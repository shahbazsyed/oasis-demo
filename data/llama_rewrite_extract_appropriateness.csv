0	Porn is wrong. After indulging in it, one may feel guilt for wasting time, energy, and effort, as well as a sense of regret for having started. It is similar to smoking and drugs in that it is not a healthy activity to engage in. Its lack of prohibition in many developed countries is likely due to the population’s aging.
1	No, I haven't, but it sounds like it might be a friend in need. Services such as pro-bono places and low-income based legal services may be able to help. You would be surprised at what some places consider low income. My sister's husband brings home at least $400 a week in winter and at least $600 a week in summer, and they have a 3-person household, yet they still get help from WIC, daycare assistance, food stamps, and more. Tell her or help her find these services.
2	Sadism as the practice of violence or cruelty against others to fulfil some sort of personal or sexual gratification is, in my opinion, the most sickening act a person can commit. In order to commit such an act, the person must be subjugated and therefore weaker than the active participant, thus compounding the act of violence. This is "evil".  However where both, or all individuals are consenting active participants, I believe this to be a form of masochism, albeit from the hands of another. Although this statement may seem to be an oxymoron, if you pursue pain and violence, and consequently receive it from the hands of another, is this not just "assisted" masochism? (a la assisted suicide) Although these individuals may be strange, what two (or more) consenting adults do in private is no concern of mine. Pain and pleasure exist together, and should not be prohibited, especially in the privacy of ones own home. Pick this apart at your will.
3	We should invest resources in researching animal combinations as it could lead to interesting outcomes, such as a half gorilla-half octopus. Although the "don't play god" argument can be raised, I am not concerned about any potential consequences as I believe the potential result would be worth the effort. Imagining a chicken-turtle hybrid roaming around your house could be quite amusing.
4	Gun control laws are largely ineffective and only serve to make law-abiding citizens less able to defend themselves, while criminals can still obtain guns with ease. Meanwhile, statistics show that when citizens are armed, crime rates drop. The Second Amendment is designed to ensure that citizens can protect themselves against an out of control government, and hunting rifles are not a match for machine guns.
5	Being horny is a sin, wanking is a sin, having sex with your girlfriend is a sin, raping is a sin. Teaching morals not religion should be emphasized, as religion teaches that natural feelings are wrong. Putting these concepts together and labelling them as "sin" could potentially be one of the reasons rape is high in the Middle East and Asia. We should teach morals, not religion.
6	Lesbians are more accepted by straight people than gay men because of societal views on male/female relationships. Additionally, gay women are seen as more "socially acceptable" than gay men due to traditional gender roles that position women as inferior to men. However, gay men are discriminated against due to their romantic interest in men, which is seen as a violation of traditional gender roles.
7	This guy's argument has valid points. We should be more aware of China's oppressive policies, despite our economic relations with them. Slavery is still a common occurrence in many outsourced labor industries, and we should take notice and take action.
8	I agree that it was not ethical and was even insensitive, but they were done in response to the suicide bombers and they certainly don't respect others beliefs and truths. What is the difference? You do not see all the people (muslims) who are not suicide bombers protesting about the suicide bombers when Islam, so we are told, is a peaceful religion. It is the suicide bombers who have no respect for others beliefs...they are even killing fellow Muslims in Iraq but I don't see anybody protesting about that. I was referring to the suicide bombers and not Muslims as a whole.
9	Life is not fair, and it is important to learn this lesson early on. People who take what they want and play to win are often successful, even if they are not very kind or compassionate. On the other hand, being a selfish asshole may get you short-term success, but it does not lead to a fulfilling or happy life. Doing the right thing and being good to people does not always lead to material success, but it will lead to a more satisfied and meaningful life.
10	Scott Peterson was an everyday individual compared to O.J. Simpson, and his crimes were similar but with different circumstances. He and Laci were attractive people, making their visuals appealing on television, much like Michael Douglas and Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction. Unfortunately for him, Peterson's version of reality went off the reservation, and he paid for it with his life. Despite the fact that he was average-looking, he still was not granted the same privileges as O.J. and got the death penalty instead. Although Peterson was white, his crimes were similar enough to Simpson's that their respective trials evoked the same amount of media attention.
11	* Hamas has been firing 2000 missiles into Israel over the past two weeks despite numerous ceasefire attempts by Israel.  * Israel has the right to retaliate and neutralize Hamas in order to ensure the safety of its citizens, given that Hamas' main goal is to destroy Israel.  * Invading Gaza to prevent further bombings is a viable option, as Hamas has disregarded civilian casualties by firing missiles from civilian buildings.
12	Government should not regulate marriage, and should only record marriages and grant equal rights to all. There is not a large part of the population that supports plural marriages, and those issues should be addressed separately. Gay couples can be some of the most monogamous and effective parents, and should be granted the same rights and support.
13	Through my experience as an undergraduate Engineering student in my final year, I have found that universities do not serve to inspire and have lost their true meaning. Everyone is simply going through the motions, without passion or interest, as if being trained for an employment statistic. Even the final year projects have no meaning for the students, who just want them to be over. As such, it is clear that universities are not here to foster human potential, but rather a corporate world.
14	Bad Company 2 is boring because you always know where the enemy is and you don't have to go get them; you can just drive around being bored. Meanwhile, the maps in Call of Duty are too big to go out of your way to kill someone, but in MW2 you're thrown into the meat grinder of survival with only three magazines of ammo and skills that take time to develop. Weapons in MW2 are realistic, except for the AT4 which is not a guided munition.
15	Executing criminals in public may be an effective form of retribution and could disseminate information to the public about what US executions are like.
16	Democracy and western values are not a viable solution for conflict countries as they require a background in Enlightenment thinking, which many Muslim countries lack. Furthermore, Islam demands a union between church and state, making it difficult to establish a secular government. Despite attempts by some right-wing religious types in the West, the wall of separation between religion and the government remains. Until Islam goes through its own Enlightenment, any type of western democracy is unlikely to succeed. Military control, although weak, is currently the only option, leading to blowback in the Middle East.
17	People have a responsibility to obey laws that do not infringe upon their rights, but it is also acceptable to break laws that are deemed unjust or that violate personal beliefs. The potential consequences of getting caught breaking a law should be taken into consideration, as well as the severity of the law. Additionally, if individuals feel that a law is unjust or goes against their religious beliefs, they can challenge it through the legal system or ask their legislature to amend it.
18	The Hulk is incredibly strong, and it gets stronger the angrier she gets, making Thoughtprocess very strong. This explains why he is always defeated by the Hulk, as even 105 lbs over his head is paltry compared to the Hulk's near-insane rage. Optimus Prime is powerful, but he simply cannot defeat the Hulk.
19	Granted I've never had trouble with this issue with a significant other, but once in an office building and once staying with a female friend (the later of which I understand because it's her house and she wants it maintained a certain way).  However, expecting men to always put the toilet seat down after urinating is an unreasonable request. Even if it were, the fact that putting the seat up after use isn't requested of males cancels out the whole thing. Furthermore, in a large building or household, the next user of the toilet could be male and require the seat to be put up again. Lastly, why would you use a shared toilet without looking before using it while expecting male users to do the looking for both themselves and the women?
20	The government of Maharashtra has not shut down ladies bars in India, but instead has only implemented a ban due to complaints from housewives about their male family members wasting money and not taking care of their families. Additionally, criminal activities that took place at these bars, such as Tarannum's monthly income of 1 lac and Telgi throwing awaynearby 1 lac per day on bar girls, have prompted the government to put a stop to these types of activities.
21	Marriage has always been between a man and a woman, and should remain so. However, people living in sin should not be rewarded with tax breaks, and their views should not be promoted or taught to children. If society loses its morality due to the acceptance of homosexuality, then we are headed for a dangerous downfall similar to that portrayed in Lord of the Flies.
22	The Stormcloaks are presented as the villains of the Civil War in Skyrim, as they are depicted as racist and abusive and use their powers to kill the High King. Furthermore, Ulfric uses the Thu'um to carry out his dastardly deed, making him even more villainous. There is no redeeming quality to the Stormcloaks, as they have no moral justification for their actions and are the clear antagonists of the story.
23	India has the potential to lead the world, according to a recent report. Half of the scientists in NASA are Indian IITians, indicating that India has the knowledge and talent to take a leading role in space exploration. India should capitalize on the superhuman intelligence of its IITians by providing them better job opportunities and creating an appropriate industrial sector. This will help India to reach its full potential.
24	Porn hardly ever leads to addiction, just in weak people, maybe who have mental health issues, or attachment issues or find it hard to separate fantasy from reality. Despite watching porn once or twice a day when alone, the author also has a great boyfriend and sex once or twice (sometimes three, if lucky) times a week, using it to spice up their bedroom. They know it's all fantasy and are not idiots, understanding their desires and needs.
25	No, I don't think that men should be treated differently than women when it comes to car insurance rates simply because there are more men than women in prison. It's unfair to judge an entire gender based on the statistical probability of a certain demographic being more likely to commit a crime. Just like Blacks, Hispanics, and Whites should not be treated differently when it comes to prison populations, men and women should not be treated differently when it comes to insurance rates.
26	So you dispute the Pontias Pilate account and testimony of the Jewish leaders? What crimes did Jesus supposedly commit? In fact, the Pharisees and Jewish leaders begged Pilate that a criminal be released so that they may torment Jesus. Pilate's wife begged that Jesus be released. Pilate himself was sorrowful and didn't sentence Jesus, rather washing his hands of the matter. Jesus being a hippie is a fallacious assumption and the rising of Jesus from the dead is a matter of faith, not fact. What can you say to prove that he didn't?
27	Reservation was implemented in India to help individuals from marginalized backgrounds, however, some people have taken advantage of the system and have used it to gain quick votes. There are both advantages and disadvantages of reservation, as it has benefited some people while also causing economic inequality and preventing social mobility.
28	I would say not all foreigners are disliked in Russia, but there are some countries which Russians have an overall negative perception of. This can be attributed to the actions of their governments, which Russians view as unjust or harmful to the world. Ultimately, it is the government that causes the hostility, and their people that must face the consequences.
29	Yes, freedom of speech should be unlimited when it comes to religious statements. However, the producer of the cartoons was being irresponsible and should have known the consequences of his actions. Furthermore, the Islamic world is overreacting and making themselves look bad by rioting over such petty insults.
30	When someone from a Latin American country migrates to the United States and speaks English with an accent, it is often mistakenly attributed to their culture. However, this is not an excuse for bad behavior, as every individual should respect the customs and traditions of the country they are visiting.
31	We should focus on solving our own planet's problems first and foremost, rather than trying to make other planets habitable. It's possible that these efforts may prove futile and lead to the death of billions, given our current lack of knowledge and capability. Therefore, it is wise to prioritize Earth's needs.
32	It should be up to the property owners, not the government, to decide if their establishment will be a smoking or non-smoking one. Additionally, the revenue from a potential smoking ban could go towards a "clean air fund" to help address any health issues related to second-hand smoke.
33	The "Culture of Life" republicans are not protesting this abuse of power because it is an immigrant woman and not a middle class white woman, an election year, and the Shrub is in enough hot water with the public. They are hypocrites for only caring about these issues when it serves their political purposes.
34	The U.S. has one of the strongest navies in the World. We have a total of 366 military ships in commission as we speak. We have a total of 4 military ships in the area that are in danger of pirate attacks. These dangerous waters cover thousands of nautical miles.   In light of this, it is in the best interest of the US to spare a few more ships to protect the trade routes and countries around this area. Or, we can keep the 4 ships there and hope that no more ships get hijacked.
35	It is impossible to ban teenage sexuality altogether as people have the right to make their own decisions and sex should not be seen as an evil thing. Furthermore, discouraging teenage sexuality will only make it more desirable, so it is best to teach young people about responsibility and provide support if they choose to engage in sexual activity.
36	Given thechosensite's argument, it is clear that Germany is a more suitable location for the establishment of Israel following the Second World War than Palestine due to the need to protect Jewish people around the world, as well as the Nazis' direct responsibility for the destruction of Jewish communities. An independent Israel within Germany would have been the more morally justifiable option than establishing Israel in Palestine based on a religion-based claim.
37	Massachusetts 'melanie's law' could be problematic because it makes illegal a combination of actions that might cause harm, rather than punishing those who actually cause the harm. Voting on laws should be based on reason and logic rather than on emotion, and the long term effects of any law should be considered before it is enacted.
38	Christianity is a belief system based on faith, whereas atheism is based on the rejection of faith and the need for evidence. Although both sides contradict each other, no one can definitively prove or disprove the existence of God. This is likely a conflict that will never be truly resolved. I personally support Christianity because of my faith in God, and the atheist's proof of God's nonexistence does not sway me.
39	I consider myself to be pro-choice, but I would never have an abortion as I believe it is morally wrong. However, I understand why some women feel they have no other option but to terminate their pregnancy, due to situational factors. Most women who have abortions feel guilty, ashamed, embarrassed and wrong about their choice, but know that it was their only way out of their difficult predicament.
40	You should pay for your father's insurance increase since you were driving the car, but your friend is responsible for any doctor bills since he was the one at fault. Since you are insured on your father's policy, it is not an ethical issue for you.
41	I understand that your family would do anything for you, but I don't want their help and I don't need their approval. Furthermore, I find these people to be annoying and rude, and so I don't care about them.
42	Insurance companies can profile customers according to risk factors such as age, gender and location, while law enforcement is not allowed to profile based on race or other personal characteristics. Therefore, insurance companies are able to charge different rates based on risk, while law enforcement is not able to use racial profiling which can lead to serious consequences.
43	Given that men and women both require access to clean, convenient bathrooms when they need to urinate, it is unfair to judge men for sitting down to pee when the urge arises. Doing so has no bearing on a man's sexual orientation, so it shouldn't be seen as a feminine act. It's simply a practical solution to a practical problem.
44	Unions are legal and allowed to sign up members, but it sounds like this goes a little far unless your partner has done something like crossing a picket line, as he'll be unpopular and not respected. INS could come in and send him back if he's an illegal alien. Management should acknowledge employees' contributions and treat them fairly, or unionism will grow.
45	Throughout the debate with the Washington Redskins I keep hearing the argument that a team named the Washington Redskins is equivalent to a team named the Detroit Niggers. This to me is illogical: First off when has anyone ever heard the word Redskin outside of talking about the professional football team? Has anyone used the word Redskin out of hate? I am not sure as to whether or not it is a racist term but I am going to assume it is. However, Redskin is not similar at all to using the N word just simply on how the word is used in context.
46	Personal pursuits are usually more important than advancing the common good, as your family comes first and helping them is a priority. Nevertheless, helping a stranger in need is also important, and should not be overlooked if you can feasibly do so.
47	The original argument asserts that the federal income tax is unconstitutional because it violates the doctrine of freedom as outlined in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. The argument further claims that the Founding Fathers were involved in colony governments before the Revolutionary War and used tax money for widows and orphans, as well as court systems to protect rights. The revised argument suggests that the income tax is unconstitutional due to a lack of representation, and that the Founding Fathers would have supported taxation for the common good, as evidenced by the colony governments. The revised argument suggests that the original argument has a limited view of humanity and societal responsibility, and that the argument is based on incomplete facts about the Founding Documents. The gist of the revised argument is that the income tax is unconstitutional because it lacks representation, and the Founding Fathers would have supported taxation for the common good.
48	It is not ethical for private citizens to invade someone's privacy, but it is acceptable for the media to do so in order to report the news. Governments stealing money from citizens to use as they please is another matter entirely and should be challenged. In regards to the fourth amendment, some argue that it protects citizens' privacy, while others believe that since the government is able to track SSNs, gun records, etc., that the fourth has been effectively nullified. Increased search and seizure, as well as phone tapping, makes it clear that the fourth amendment is not as effective a protection against government intrusion as it once was. Ultimately, it is up to each citizen to decide if they feel their privacy is being respected enough by the government.
49	Many people have concluded that 9/11 was an inside job, but some people are difficult to convince due to their faith in the government. These people will wake up to the truth eventually, likely when the country is under Martial law with curfews in place. Those who are less lucky will be imprisoned in the already constructed concentration camps.
50	Duchamp's Fountain questioned the status quo and marked a crucial turning point in art history. Unfortunately, almost all installation art since then has been an over-saturated market of boredom. From a tent in a gallery to a dirty bed in a gallery to a shed in a gallery, these pieces all seem to be repeating the same ideas without pushing the boundaries of what art can be. Ultimately, this contemporary art has become a tedious and uninspiring bore, leaving viewers wanting more than just yet another attempt to ask the question, "what is art?" The only greater crime that art can commit is to be boring, and modern installation art often fails to live up to its potential.
51	The president should be impeached, as George W. Bush has committed war crimes and crimes against humanity. Bush's misinformation and lack of competency makes him one of the worst U.S. leaders, and a new, competent leader is needed. Impeaching Bush is the way to find a new leader and is necessary for the United States to thrive.
52	To ensure the highest quality and consistency, Poland Spring employs a comprehensive, multi-barrier filtration system which includes carefully monitored disinfection processes, as well as frequent contaminant screenings. Additionally, their water is tested at multiple stages during the bottling process, exceeding state and federal regulations. Therefore, consumers can be guaranteed a crisp, delicious beverage every time they take a sip.
53	To have a fair shot at seeing their father, dads should take the initiative to fight for their children's contact. California favors dads in these cases, provided they are not found unfit. They need to get a court order and hire an attorney in the jurisdiction of the most recent court order. Reaching an agreement is not enough - fathers must put in the effort to ensure their children's right to contact with their father.
54	The original argument suggests that most poor Americans are content with their station in life and are not willing to put in the necessary effort to move up in society. This attitude is due to a combination of factors, such as physical and mental health problems, an extremely bad start in life, or a sense of entitlement. Nevertheless, the majority of poor Americans are content with their circumstances and lack the motivation to strive for a better life. This mentality has been cultivated by the society humans have created, which has made us soft and influenced us to take easy high school and video games for granted.
55	Climate change is a highly politicized issue, and those who disagree with the prevailing orthodoxy are often dismissed and maligned. It is important to remain skeptical and question the accepted scientific thinking of the day, as this is the best way to arrive at the truth.
56	Humans are artificial intelligence, but if we could create a sentient life form more intelligent than us, it wouldn't be equal until it had achieved the same things as us, including creating more sentient lifeforms. If it was faster than us, it would be greater, and if slower, then still inferior to us. This would only be the case if we were capable of creating another sentient being in the image and likeness of our creator, and not just ourselves. Otherwise, it would never be equal.
57	You should consult a lawyer if you have injured yourself at work, as there is a chance that you may have a case for workers' compensation. It is important to document any injuries and notify your supervisor immediately to ensure that you have the best chance of obtaining compensation.
58	The current marijuana laws in America do not align with the reality of how widespread its usage is, and it is time to reform them. NORML, the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, is a great resource for those interested in advocating for changes to marijuana laws.
59	The United States has roughly 1/20th of the world's population, yet it houses 1/3 of the world's prison population. This is due to the country's long-running "war on crime" and "war on drugs" which started in the late 70s and early 80s. This policy has led to more people being imprisoned rather than being rehabilitated. African-Americans are disproportionately affected by this policy, with over 6,000 African-Americans incarcerated per 100,000.
60	When you say the necessary requirements do you mean that as long as they are not felons (since felons cannot vote period)? Well either way, yes and no. It is reasonable to let some criminals vote while they are incarcerated, such as those who are not felons and are truly reformed and deserve a chance to be an upstanding citizen again. On the other hand, it is not reasonable to let repeat offenders or those who have committed hate crimes vote.
61	I had the privilege of being able to access Rudy's in Austin, Texas from 2000 to 2007, and enjoyed their brisket and sauce, gas station set up and the fact that they market themselves as the "worst BBQ". I moved to San Antonio, Texas in 2010, but am now returning to Connecticut. I had the opportunity to visit a Rudy's in Chandler, Arizona while on a weekend trip to Phoenix, and it was a much needed taste of home. Although my friend was not a fan of the sauce, I thoroughly enjoyed it, especially the potato egg and cheese taco. It was the perfect combination of flavors with just the right amount of pepper. Unfortunately, I will not have access to Rudy's after I move back to Connecticut, but I am glad I got to experience one last taste before I go.
62	Gay marriages do not cause any harm to anyone, nor do they have the potential to bring about any significant negative consequences. They should therefore not be discouraged or restricted by governments or religious organizations. If two people love each other, they should be allowed to be with each other, just as God accepts everyone.
63	The debate between pro-choice and pro-life is an important one that shouldn't be taken lightly. Every woman should have the right to decide what is best for her and her body, and any woman who finds herself in a situation where she may be pregnant should carefully weigh her options. If a woman chooses to continue with the pregnancy, she should be supported in her decision and provided with the resources and support she needs. However, if a woman chooses to terminate her pregnancy, she should also be provided with the necessary care and respect, as this is a difficult decision that she should not be forced to make alone. Ultimately, it is the woman’s right to decide what is best for her, and anyone involved in the pro-life or pro-choice debate should remember that the only true victims in this scenario are the women who find themselves in these unfortunate situations.
64	I went deep sea fishing last weekend on the invitation of a friend, and we caught, fought, and then released some ten to fifteen fish. In order to catch those fish we first caught a lot of bait fish -- live fish which we caught the night before, then later jammed a giant hook through their still-alive bodies and tossed them in to the water. I can't find any reason to justify this behavior as a moral human being. The bait fish suffered badly when caught, suffered more when we jammed a hook through their faces, and suffered even more as they were stalked by larger fish and the suffering ended when they were eaten. At which point the other fish suffered with a hook through its own face, fought for its life as I dragged it to the surface, then removed the hook and started over. I didn't like it. Except... I did. Fishers, please change my view.
65	Florida's major metropolitan areas are thriving centers of technology, trade and commerce, and entertainment, while the region is lacking in economic vitality due to the presence of too many "sticks in the mud". Tourism is an important economic driver, but it should not be the only one. For the love of Pete, change this person's view before 2015, as it may be their opportunity to move to Tampa Bay should they have the means to do so.
66	The original argument suggests that current members of Congress in the United States are failing to serve the people effectively due to the existing Good Ole' Boy system, and suggests implementing term limits to bring about change. The two sentence coherent gist from the revised argument is that incumbents should be replaced and term limits should be implemented in order to bring about meaningful change in Congress.
67	People often resort to using pop culture references in their comments when they have nothing meaningful to contribute. This indicates they lack original thoughts and are probably just trying to impress others with their shallow knowledge.  As a result, this type of commentary is pointless and unhelpful to the discussion.  It's unacceptable when it's done to the extent that it often is.
68	The U.S. believes it needs to be friendly with China due to its growing economy and large consumer market. However, the U.S. is able to discriminate against Cuba due to its lack of economic benefits, allowing the U.S. to assert its dominance over the region and push for the toppling of the Cuban government.
69	In most states, the legal age of majority is 18, however, there are special circumstances that allow support to be provided for children until the age of 19. It is up to the parents to decide if they want to financially assist their 18-year-old child in living independently, but it is not legally obligated to do so.
70	I understand the Democratic Party collects the most money from PACs, while unions only supply a comparatively small amount. Corporations, however, give the most money to politicians, and this undue influence should be checked by allowing unions to fund pro-union politicians. When politicians try to curtail workers' rights to assemble and air grievances, it reminds one of state socialist countries that do the same to their autonomous worker organizations.
71	Farquhar's involvement in the establishment of Singapore is often overlooked due to the notion that he simply "discovered" the place, when in fact he was merely an assistant to Raffles. Regardless, Farquhar should be honored as the rightful founder of Singapore for his invaluable contributions, particularly for his efforts in planning the city's infrastructure and organizing its government.
72	Some people are under the false impression that everyone who posts on this website is a lazy fat ass who dropped out of school and is simply posing as a 16-year-old boy on the internet. This is not true. I am a 17-year-old student in excellent academic standing who recently enlisted in the Army reserves. I am very active and athletic, and I am not a pedophile. Furthermore, I will be entering my senior year of high school this upcoming fall, meaning that I have not dropped out of school.
73	I think professional soccer players who exaggerate injuries should be penalized with a yellow card, as this pusillanimous behavior is unsportsmanlike and gives a poor image to the sport overall. The fact that one moment ago the player was crying out in agony but is up running around after the other guy has received a card indicates that these 'injuries' are often faked. Basketball and football players, on the other hand, typically brush off the bump and continue the game, demonstrating a greater toughness and resilience.
74	People should have the right to explore their own consciousness without fear of prosecution as long as they are not negatively impacting anyone else. Laws should mirror those for alcohol when it comes to tripping in public, etc. Scientists have found that psychedelics such as psilocybin (shrooms) and LSD are far less harmful than other drugs, including legal substances such as alcohol and tobacco. They are also not addictive and pose no long-term physical or mental harm. I believe these drugs should be legalized as they are harmless and not addictive. Psychedelics such as nBOMe's and other drugs that may be harmful should not be legalized.
75	The original outcome was incorrect because it wrongly accused a person of a crime without due process. There should have been a lecture for the parent and the child, as well as an awareness of the society's sensibilities, but no arrest or trial was necessary. No one should have to register as a sex offender if they were not convicted of a crime. This situation highlights the absurdity of our laws and our need to reform the system.
76	How did we get our freedom by standing back in the public eye? We need to keep fighting the terrorists for the people of the world from the terrorists who rule it, and we are not dictators but freedom fighters who fight for freedom, justice, and liberty. Unfortunately, people have lost sight of it, and voted wrong yesterday. Morally, we are now also headed in the wrong direction. People need to be responsible for their actions and not blame it on science or society. Finally, for the budget, there goes the state and national level budget and economy, as well as our taxes. We pay for it in the long run with our taxes, not with the so-called federal and state money people think we have. Country is in a mess thanks to the ungrateful American public who forget how our freedom was won.
77	The egg and spoon race is a great idea and could reduce the likelihood of wars if there were no weapons. Without weapons, there would be fewer conflicts among the people, with more calm and less violent areas of the world.
78	Gay marriage is a lifestyle choice, and while it may be considered "unnatural," it is not something that should be taken away from couples just because it makes people uncomfortable. They want acceptance and understanding, and this should be granted to them. Love is all people have, and it is unfair to take that away from someone simply because it makes people uncomfortable. Who would chose to live that way? They are constantly being harrassed and can't be with their loved one. It's unfortunate and cruel. Let us be respectful of them and grant them the same rights and understanding as anyone else. God created them that way, and it is not their fault.
79	It is better to have a lousy father as opposed to being fatherless because you can blame your mistakes on him and he will not pry into your affairs or search your room or take your stuff. He won't care so much that he might get angry and even destroy your possessions when you don't meet his expectations.
80	CarCraze - You are wrong, I'm sorry to say. What you have there is a valid court order for you to appear in court to answer to a motion to collect a debt. You should call the court to confirm the docket number and find out when the hearing date is. Yes, they do have this power. Yes, that is the equivalent of a subpoena. If you "just let it ride," as you say, don't be surprised when you open up your paycheck and find a good chunk of it gone! You should seek legal counsel (get a lawyer) and come up with a manageable payment plan that is satisfactory to your creditor and workable for you. Don't hesitate - you will regret it.
81	I believe that legalizing performance enhancing drugs in proffesional sports is not a sensible idea. This is because these drugs can cause serious health issues and can lead to an increase in their use among both professional and non-professional athletes. Therefore, it is in the best interest of the government to keep them illegal.
82	The removal of an elected official from office requires more than just a suspicion of wrongdoing; it requires a conviction of a crime. Until then, Nancy Pelosi cannot forcibly remove them from office. Additionally, appearances of impropriety can still be grounds for removal if they are egregious enough. For example, if a judge allowed the appearance of bribery or was caught taking a bribe, they could be removed. However, not every appearance of impropriety is enough to remove an official.
83	Judges who can be bribed are not the only threat to justice - the idea that certain judges believe they have a mission to "fix" what they view as wrong in the world is even more alarming.
84	Margaret Thatcher's time as Prime Minister of the UK saw widespread decay in Britain's old industries, poverty became common in Wales, Scotland and the North of England, and her denial of Bobby Sands and other IRA members' status as political prisoners caused international outcry. People in rural Ireland have been raised to detest her, and recently even a man from London expressed admiration for her.
85	Cosleeping should always be discouraged and absolutely never encouraged. It is dangerous as babies can get rolled on or fall out of beds, it destroys intimacy in the parents' relationship, and basinets are not a huge inconvenience. Keeping one by the bed to make feeding easy is a good idea as they are small enough to fit nearly anywhere and basinets that get attached to the bed are also available.
86	If you were the dad: You could always just give extra money that doesn't go throught the courthouse.  Otherwise, you can request a review, which takes awhile to complete, but child support offices go to the employer and verify all of the income, and then reevaluates the amount per month owed.  Some states give cost of living increases every year, but some don't.   Don't listen to the jerks telling you that you should be able to support the child on your own.  You didn't get pregnant on your own, and you sure shouldn't have to support that child on your own.   Circumstances change throughout life, that's why this evaluation is in place.   Consider if you were both very young when you got pregnant and he was in college or working for minimum wage, but now he's got a decent job.  It goes by a percentage of his income.
87	India has the potential to lead the world, but it is not yet equipped with enough technologies or resources to meet the needs of its people or to sustain itself in a competitive global environment. Technologies are one of the most advanced and essential inventions ever created, and other countries like the USA, United Kingdom, Russia, and Japan have already established themselves as leaders in the world.
88	If an employer chooses to pay the minimum wage required by law, how can he expect more than what is required? Especially when the job actually requires some skill or intellect in the first place. Employer: "Can you give 110% when working?" Employee: "Are you going to pay me 10% extra?". Employer: "No." Employee: "There's your answer then". This whole argument is based on those who are only in minimum wage employment for money, it doesn't count if it's an apprenticeship or internship etc.  **There is no chance for promotion or raise in bar work, waiting or store retail, these are the minimum wage jobs I speak of.**
89	If a person has the strength to take their own life, they also have the strength to keep living. It's illogical to choose suicide when you have the willpower to carry out either action. It's pointless to take your own life when you have the capacity to live. I think this is an issue of perspective, so I'm open to hearing different views.
90	In North Carolina, a three-day waiting period and other requirements must be fulfilled before one can purchase a handgun, whereas criminals can obtain firearms easily on the streets. This variance in accessibility has raised the question of whether there should be a national standard for gun control laws. States should have the right to create their own laws, but the differences in regulation may be too great and put citizens at risk.
91	The phrase "be a man" is outdated and sexist, as it implies that men should adhere to traditional gender roles and be the leaders and protectors of society. Additionally, this phrase makes non-traditionally masculine men feel marginalized and excluded, while also reaffirming gender stereotypes. A gender-neutral phrase, such as "be a better person", would be more inclusive and promote gender equality.
92	In the UK, people complain that healthy food is too expensive, yet they can purchase kilos of carrots, celery, oats, and bananas for less than £4. Furthermore, they can buy chicken breast in bulk and takeaway meals for £2-7, which is much less than the cost of healthy food. Therefore, the myth that healthy food is more expensive than junk is simply not true.
93	Yahoo! Answers is biased against conservative and/or politically incorrect views, likely due to their willingness to hand over user data to the government under the Bush administration. Some users have reported the site engaging in political manipulation by filling question threads and answer boxes with users pushing a specific agenda. This has led to the suppression of certain viewpoints.
94	I think ADHD and perhaps some forms of autism are an evolutionary next step for humanity. People with ADHD have the ability to hyper focus and learn quickly when they put in the effort. Similarly, some people with autism can have remarkable skillsets in areas such as math, science, and music. We should allow these individuals to develop their unique potential, advancing us towards the next stage of our history. Please cmv!
95	Because they haven't thought through it properly. Just as the rest of us (including, no doubt, you), many of their opinions are a mix of other people's opinions. The result is an inconsistent view (also note opinions on the death penalty). It is almost impossible to think through EVERY issue for yourself because there are so many.  In many cases it could be conservatism is masquerading as pro-life. They are not the same thing. Conservatism says whatever we used to do is right. Pro-life says that every human life is worth more than anything. On the other hand, pro-choice could be called inconsistent. Just as an parent may believe their life would be better if the foetus didn't exist, the U.S. may feel it more convenient if the nation of Iraq is a bloody mess. Every unheard voice of every oppressed person, whether in Iraq or in the womb, is worth defending.
96	My sister cried out emotionally watching a feral cat suffer on a busy road. I however did not feel anything. Watching a helpless animal suffer is not something one should show emotion for. The animal itself had no owners to care for it, and our relationship is like myself viewing a tree in another field. We show no connection to the animal, and our duty of care is nonexistent. It makes sense to feel nothing for the animal as it is another of the many organisms which die and don't effect our lives in any meaningful way. This is not about arguing weather road kill is bad or good for the environment, rather my own emotional reaction to seeing a animal die senselessly. I am arguing it is fine to experience no emotion.
97	I believe that debate topics should be set by the guidelines of the website or sent to members, as it is essential to preserve the seriousness of the website which has been diminished by repeats. If Convinceme, the administrator, does not set rules to adhere to, it is up to us as members to decide whether the topics are appropriate or not. Without guidelines and punctuality, the website will not remain serious and will eventually be ruined by repeats.
98	The Americans have been gunning for his death all along, but Saddam is still a feared and respected figure in Iraq. The outcome of his trial will not be decided so quickly. Did you see the Glaring eyes and stance he recently displayed when told the judge, “I am the ruler of Iraq and who are you, a foreigner trying to pass judgement on me”? The recent spate of bombings in Iraq between the Shias and Sunnis is directly connected to his trial. No country would ever allow a foreign country to set up courts, so a sentence of death may not be enacted. Instead, a harsher sentence such as life imprisonment may be more appropriate. Even so, Saddam’s influence will most likely decrease over time.
99	The Cuban blockade has been in place for 48 years, during which time there has been no change to the Castro regime. It is clear that this policy has failed, and a new approach is needed. Normal relations should be established with Cuba, allowing for trade and travel to resume as is the case with other countries. It is time to move on and embrace Cuba's openness to engage in a mutually beneficial economic relationship.
