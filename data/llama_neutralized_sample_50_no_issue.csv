0	The argument that porn would expose one to the reality in life, and thus increasing one's maturity and preventing potential future sexual assaults, is invalid. Porn is definitely wrong. After indulging in it, the guilt of wasting one's time, energy, and effort, and not dedicating oneself to another activity and regretfully saying goodbye to it later would almost kill one. I assure you. It is a path that should not be taken, just as smoking and drugs. The only reason it is not banned in most developed countries is that they are facing an aging population.
1	No, I haven't been able to help yet, but it sounds like it might be a friend. In some cases, free or low-cost legal services are available to those with low incomes. You would be surprised at what some places consider low income! My sister's husband brings home at least $400 a week in winter and at least $600 a week in summer, and they have a three-person household. They earn around $46,000 a year and receive help from WIC, daycare assistance, food stamps, and other services. Perhaps you could suggest to her or help her find these services.
2	Sadism as the practice of violence or cruelty against others to fulfil some sort of personal or sexual gratification is, in my opinion, the most sickening act a person can commit. In order to commit such an act, the perpetrator must be subjugated and therefore weaker than the active participant, thus compounding the act of violence. This is "evil". However, where both, or all individuals are consenting active participants, I believe this to be a form of masochism, albeit from the hands of another. Although this statement may seem to be an oxymoron, if you pursue pain and violence, and consequently receive it from the hands of another, is this not just "assisted" masochism? (a la assisted suicide) Although these individuals may be strange, what two (or more) consenting adults do in private is no concern of mine. Pick this apart at your will.
3	I think we should invest heavily in research into creating fascinating hybrids between animals. For example, a gorilla/octopus combination, with its furry face, two legs, and six wavy arms, would be incredible to behold. While it might cost a lot and cause some animals to be harmed, I firmly believe the end result would be worth it. Furthermore, I do not agree with the "playing God" argument; I'm not concerned that an angry deity will smite us for our creations. Imagine the potential of a turtle with a chicken's head walking around your house! The possibilities are truly exciting.
4	That's just ignorant thinking. A criminal will find a way, whether it's a gun, knife, or baseball bat. It's just "feel good" legislation. Makes the liberals think they are doing something to combat crime (while letting the criminals run rampant).  Statistics show that criminals do less when up against a well-armed citizen. (And crime rates drop). And for the record, the second amendment is there to protect our rights to be able to fight back against a government that goes out of control. And hunting rifles against machine guns isn't an even matchup.
5	Being aroused is a sin.  Masturbating is a sin.  Having sex with your girlfriend is a sin.  Raping is a sin.  If this is what young men are taught, how can they have an understanding of what right and wrong actually are? We should teach morals, not religion.  Religion teaches that natural feelings are wrong. You don't tell a woman that feeling cold is wrong, so why tell a man that acting on his arousal is wrong? I'm not saying rape is right, but putting the two in the same context of a "sin" is causing confusion.
6	In a society traditionally and, to be honest, still dominated by men, men's general consensus is more popular than women's general consensus, and I think we all know that a lot of men consider lesbians to be downright sexy, because there is no man in the picture to ruin the aesthetic. Additionally, gay women are more "socially acceptable," for one of the traditional reasons behind homophobia: women are inferior to men. Gay men are discriminated against because they have no honor: romantic interest in men is for women only, and when an man participates he is "lowering himself" to a women's level. However, when a woman participates in the same activities, she is participating in something unique and special. Thus, gay women are discriminated against less because romantic interest in women is a man's attribute, giving them honor.
7	This guy has a valid point. While there may not be evidence of Yahoo!’s direct involvement in Chinese government oppression, we do know that the Chinese government is oppressive to anyone who questions or disagrees with its policies. Torture and beatings are still a regular occurrence in China, despite any potential improved labor standards. America has chosen to look the other way, as we prioritize preserving our good economic relations with China. We need to open our eyes and start recognizing the truth.
8	I agree that it was not ethical and was even insensitive, but they were done in response to the suicide bombers and they certainly don't respect others beliefs and truths. What is the difference? You do not see all the people (muslims) who are not suicide bombers protesting about the suicide bombers when Islam, so we are told, is a peaceful religion. It is the suicide bombers who have no respect for others beliefs...they are even killing fellow Muslims in Iraq but I don't see anybody protesting about that. I was referring to the suicide bombers and not Muslims as a whole.
9	You can be a kind, compassionate person and still experience adversity. Conversely, you can go through life being a selfish asshole and be successful, at least in the short term. People who are successful in life often take what they want and play to win. However, this comes at a cost, as often those who pursue success in such a way will eventually face consequences for their actions. Similarly, those who do right by others and are respectful often don't receive the same rewards.   I think this is a fair assessment; life isn't always fair, and people who are innocent can go to prison while those who are hardworking often still struggle to get ahead. Being good and doing right do not always lead to success, nor do they guarantee one's safety from harm. It's unfortunate, but this is the way the world works.
10	Scott Peterson was the polar opposite to OJ Simpson. He wasn't a celebrity, he was an everyday person. Like OJ, he murdered the mother of his children. The similarities end there. He and Laci, were good-looking, thus making the TV images more pleasing to the viewers. We watched it for the same reasons we watched Michael Douglas and Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction. Scott is just an everyday white man. As with most people who have an affair, particularly when the wife is at home pregnant, his actions were a red flag to the rest of us.  1) Don't lose sight of reality and think that life will be great after you kill your pregnant wife and hook up with the psycho-chic who was f**king you while your wife was pregnant.  2) If you are an everyday white man, you will not get away with a crime like OJ got away with. It still seems that a black celebrity can work their celebrity magic on a jury - right Michael?
11	Hamas has fired hundreds of missiles into Israel over the past two weeks, despite numerous attempts by Israel to secure a ceasefire. This indicates that Hamas has no intention of peace and is seeking to destroy Israel. Given this, Israel has the right to retaliate in order to protect its citizens. Furthermore, Hamas's main goal of destroying Israel means that they must be neutralized. The civilian casualties caused by Hamas are unforgivable, as they fire missiles from within civilian buildings. Thus, Israel has the right to invade Gaza and prevent further bombings.
12	This debate has made it clear to me that the government shouldn't really be in the business of marriage. Let churches perform marriages for whomever they deem fit and grant equal rights to them all. As for plural marriages, they exist but there is not a large part of the population that supports them. That is a different debate for another day and the issues are quite distinct. In my opinion, the purpose of marriage/civil union is to provide support to individuals, especially when they are raising children. Some of the most monogamous couples I know are gay, and they are some of the best parents too.
13	Through my experience as an undergraduate Engineering student in my final year, I have come to the realization that the university environment can be uninspiring. After three years, you come to see that everyone is simply passing through, and you are merely trained to become another figure in an employment statistic for the department you are in. Worst of all, it seems that no one notices. For example, when I chose to do a final year project that I was passionate about, no one else seemed to share this enthusiasm and just wanted it to be over. Therefore, I have come to the conclusion that universities are not designed to serve humanity, but instead serve as a production line for the corporate world.
14	Bad company is boring since it's difficult to kill people on there and the controls are awkward, the vehicles are boring and are hard to control for some reason, and the maps are way too big. On COD, the map called Wasteland is one of the biggest and people hate that map. MW2 is very intense because it keeps you wondering what's about to come from around that corner or if a sniper is up in a window or hiding on a roof ready to put a bullet in your head or if your about to get hit by a thrown grenade, but you still have to go and get them. On Battlefield, you always know where the enemy is and you don't have to go get them, you can just drive around and be bored, and the maps are too big to go out of your way to kill someone. Unlike MW2, your thrown into the meat grinder of survival with only three magazines of ammo and skills that take time to develop. Plus, weapons on MW2 are realistic except for the AT4 which is not a guided munition.
15	I often hear people advocating for increased enforcement of the death penalty. Although I am undecided on my personal opinion of it, I believe the death penalty serves as a form of retaliation by society. Shouldn’t we want as many people as possible to witness what happens when someone is sentenced to death? At the very least, this could inform people’s beliefs about the death penalty and perhaps even dissuade them from supporting it.
16	You can't impose democracy on Muslim countries through military force. They lack the Enlightenment background that the United States had when it formed its constitutional republic. Islam demands that church and state be unified, with the rule of law coming from the Quran. Despite the efforts of some conservative religious types in the West, we have a wall of separation between religion and government, allowing citizens to follow the dictates of their conscience. Muslim countries need to go through their own Enlightenment process before any type of western democracy will have a chance to succeed. Until then, our only option is to keep a tenuous control through military force, which is now causing blowback in the Middle East.
17	Law is an obligation of the society to which a person has to abide. Any law that violates your rights is morally wrong. However, your right should not hinder/hurt other people's rights/sentiments. Breaking a law is dangerous when you are prone to get caught, but people tend to bend laws and break laws when the penalty is not severe, such as speeding, not wearing seat belts, etc. Any law would be right if it does not infringe upon the realms of human rights and religious beliefs of a person. If you are unhappy with any law, you can challenge it in the court of justice or ask your legislature to change/modify. This is a long and tedious process, but it is the only way to achieve a lasting solution.
18	I'd have to vote for Thoughtprocess' Momma, otherwise known as The Hulk. The Hulk is incredibly strong and gets stronger the angrier she gets, which is why Thoughtprocess is so strong. Every single defeat I hand him, along with my own superior strength, enrages him to the point of near - insanity. This is why he's always wrong on the issues! Additionally, I can press 105 pounds over my head, which is more than double his paltry 100 pound capacity. Snapilicious!
19	Granted I've never had trouble with this issue with a significant other, but once in an office building and once staying with a female friend (the later of which I understand because it's her house and she wants it maintained a certain way).  The argument is that it's considerate to put the seat up after use, but the counterpart of not putting the seat up is that it then needs to be put up by the next user. And even if it were then it just cancels the whole thing out.    In a large building or household, this could be an issue because the next person to use the toilet could be male and need to urinate in which case he now needs to put the seat up again.  Lastly, why would you use a shared toilet without looking before using it while expecting male users to do the looking for both themselves and the women.?
20	You are wrong, my dear. The ban has been enacted in Maharashtra, not across India. The state government took this measure due to the numerous complaints from housewives about their male family members wasting money on ladies’ bars and not taking care of their families. Additionally, many criminal activities have been associated with these establishments, as seen in the Tarannum and Telgi cases, where Tarannum was making approximately one lac rupees per month and Telgi was throwing away near about one lac per day on the bar girls. To put an end to such criminal activities, the Maharashtra government has implemented the ban.
21	Marriage has traditionally been between a man and a woman. If two people want to live in a romantic relationship together, I have no issue with that. However, they shouldn't be rewarded with tax breaks or receive any special recognition for their relationship. Moreover, I do not want my children to be exposed to or indoctrinated with the notion that homosexuality is an acceptable lifestyle. If we continue down this path, there is potential for society to deteriorate even further. (Lord of the Flies)
22	Ulfric and the Stormcloaks are portrayed as villains in the game, while Emperor Palpatine and the Imperial forces are presented as the antagonists of the main conflict. The Stormcloaks are presented as racist and abusive towards those different from them, which paints them as villains in the modern context and makes them morally bankrupt. Furthermore, Ulfric's use of the Thu'um to kill the High King paints him as an extreme and powerful villain. This makes the Stormcloaks the obvious bad guys in the story, as they have no redeeming qualities other than not being the ones who want to cut off your head at the beginning. Try to counter my argument by proving to me that the Stormcloaks have something that paints them as good in any way.
23	According to a recent report, 50% of scientists at NASA are Indian IITians. Imagine if these scientists were to join the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) - our status, value and astronomical knowledge of India would definitely increase.  Think about IITians, students who are qualifying the Institute. They are known to be superbrains. If India is capable of providing world-class educational institutions, then why are we unable to take the best advantages from them? This is due to brain drain, lack of industrial development, suitable working environments, and proper salaries. It is thus the need of the hour to improve our industrial sector.
24	All these arguments about pornography leading to addiction are becoming quite tedious. It is true that only certain vulnerable individuals may be prone to developing an issue with viewing pornography, such as those who have underlying mental health issues, attachment issues, or difficulties separating fantasy from reality. Nevertheless, it is important to be mindful of the potential for harm in overindulging in this activity. One can enjoy pornography in moderation as a form of entertainment and sexual stimulation, but it should not be relied upon exclusively to meet one's sexual needs. Using it as a tool to enhance one's relationship with their partner is a healthy and positive way to incorporate it into one's life, but it is still important to be aware of one's boundaries. It is advisable to be mindful of the content being viewed and make sure that it is comfortable and safe to do so. Ultimately, it is up to the individual to decide how they want to incorporate pornography into their lifestyle.
25	Yes, I understand the fact that there are studies showing how young men can be more reckless than women, but that shouldn't be a good enough reason to treat men any differently than women. For example, "Whites, who make up 78 percent of the U.S. population, accounted for 35 percent of the state prison population. Blacks, who make up 13 percent of the U.S. population, were 38 percent of the state prison population. Hispanics, who make up 17 percent of the U.S. population, were 21 percent of the state prison population." Does this mean Blacks or Hispanics should be treated differently just because there are statistically more of them in prison? No. This, I feel, is a good analogy as to why men should be getting the same insurance rates as women. I'm not a 'masculinist', but It just strikes me as unfair. I would love to hear some other opinions! Thank you for taking the time to read :]
26	So you dispute the testimony of Pontius Pilate and the Jewish leaders? What crimes did Jesus supposedly commit? In fact, the Pharisees and Jewish leaders begged Pilate that a criminal be released so that they may torment Jesus. Pilate's wife begged that Jesus be released. Pilate himself was sorrowful and didn't sentence Jesus, rather washing his hands of the matter. Hippie? I believe nomad would be a better term. And, in that case, he was no different than any other nomadic person or tribe. Most wore their hair long (except for proper Roman citizens), and togas or other robes. And sandals were the only footwear available. You are hardly justified in calling Jesus a hippie, much less the first hippie. And by all accounts, Jesus was a Nazarene. And Jesus being married is a fallacious assumption. The whole controversy is really based on whether or not He rose from the dead. Eye witness accounts claim that he did. What can you say to prove that he didn't?
27	No thing is bad or good in itself; it is how it is used, implemented, and taken up that determines its value. In India, reservation was originally implemented for 15 years to please certain people and secure votes. The Mandal Commission was later used to further this agenda, despite lying dormant for years. There are various aspects of reservation that are worthy of debate, such as the question of whether or not some strata of society need additional support to move up the social ladder. Unfortunately, those who stand to benefit are often not the ones who need it most, and the opposition to reservation is often fueled by people who would rather see those benefits go to those who are already well-off. No one would object if the benefits were actually reaching those who are truly in need. This is especially true since it is clear that the current system is not working as intended.
28	I would argue that not all foreign countries are equally popular, with some being more favored than others. Just as with individuals, certain countries have certain reputations that make them more or less well-liked by the rest of the world. Countries that are violent, deceitful, or otherwise unfit for the world stage are likely to be disliked by the international community, and their people will pay the price for their government's actions.
29	Yes, it should be of unlimited proportions. Freedom of speech should not and cannot be twisted to the point where it is no longer freedom of speech. However, freedom of speech goes hand in hand with the idea of personal responsibility and accountability. Producing those cartoons was technically legal, but it was irresponsible. Surely the cartoonist knew that those cartoons would cause trouble in extremist countries. However, I also think that the Islamic world is greatly overreacting. They are ruining their credibility and making themselves look like a bunch of whinging little kids who riot at the most petty insult. Do you know how many "Jesus Christ" parody websites exist online? How many Christians burn down embassies for stuff like that?
30	I just don't know if you are referring to all Latinos as a whole or to a specific group. I know that many people born south of the USA, may speak the same way due to Spanish being their native tongue, which is why when they move to speak English they may have a similar accent. Let me tell you something, not all Latinos are the same; Puerto Ricans, Cubans, Dominicans are very different to the rest of Latin America. You don't say to an Irish person he is British, to a Canadian he is American, or to a Basque he is Spanish. Culture shouldn't be an excuse to do something wrong, when you are allowed into another country you should learn their customs and traditions. To say that because of my culture I do this or that, is just a lame excuse to avoid responsibility.
31	I don't think it's a waste of time, but I believe we should prioritize solving our own world's problems first. The Earth is facing a number of challenges, such as poverty, overpopulation, pollution, and the biggest threat of all - global warming. This could potentially result in the deaths of 6.5 billion people, if not more. Scientists should focus on these issues first and find solutions. If these efforts prove to be impossible, we'll know it's pointless to search for other habitable planets. We should use our resources wisely and make sure we aren't placing too much emphasis on exploration and discovery at the expense of our own survival.
32	I don't think that it should be a government choice; it should be the owner of the property's choice. I have yet to be anywhere where smoke bothered me because most places are non-smoking; bars in Ohio are mostly non-smoking anyway. And while smoke might smell on my clothes and hair the next day, my breath probably smells just as bad after a night of drinks. This is just a way for people to control and get money; one of the issues on the ballot states that the money will go to a “clean air fund.” If smoking is banned, why would we need a “clean air fund?” And what on earth would we do with the money? I prefer my money to go to my child’s college fund; but if this passes, won’t I have a choice?
33	I appreciate your argument that the "Culture of Life" folks are a bunch of politically motivated hypocrites. While I am grateful that this lady was permitted to die without being the center of a public controversy, I cannot help but feel cold comfort. I am sorry that compassion did not move anyone to wait for her mother.
34	The U.S. has one of the strongest navies in the world. We have a total of 366 military ships in commission as we speak. We have a total of 4 military ships in the area that are in danger of pirate attacks. These dangerous waters cover THOUSANDS of nautical miles. So can a mere 4 ships protect this huge expanse of sea? Not effectively. So why can't the most powerful navy in the world spare a few more ships to protect the trade routes and countries around this area? Or would we rather keep the 4 ships there and hope that no more ships get hijacked? I prefer the first option. I mean, hundreds of ships peacefully pass through the dangerous waters each day, some with the intentions to provide aid to third world countries. Is it truly politically correct to allow trade routes to be dangerous and hostile? Nope.
35	People are free to make their own decisions in life. Yes, it can be disappointing when there are serious consequences, but it's not right to belittle their choices. Sex should not be seen as evil or dirty. Teaching kids about responsibility and having open dialogue is the best way to go. Jails are already overcrowded and criminalizing youth for exploring their sexualities will only make it worse. You should know from experience that discouraging something only increases the desire to do it. Everyone has the right to make their own decisions and learn from their experiences.
36	The establishment of Israel is often cited as necessary to protect people of Jewish heritage from around the world. To the victors go the spoils, so why not annex a portion of Germany and resettle a population whose government actively worked to destroy the Jews, in order to promote acceptance of Jewish visitors in their "Holy Land"? I am aware that not all Germans were complicit in the actions of the Nazis, but the annexation of a portion of Germany would be more morally justifiable than establishing a state in a highly dangerous location due to an ancient religion-based claim. If Jewish security is the issue, then a piece of Germany would have been the superior option. CMV.
37	I haven't followed this political case, but I believe that any law named after a person is questionable since those pushing it will often be reacting based on emotion and grief, rather than reason.  Any good law will have safeguards, and rational provisions so that whatever action is made illegal is really the action that is the threat. I generally oppose laws that make actions illegal just because they might, in combination with other actions, have the potential to cause harm. I believe in punishing those who cause the harm, and not limiting action based purely on speculation.   That being said, the voting process has become an emotional one. People -- whether voters or legislators -- pass laws based on their gut reactions, often without any concern for the consequences or long term effects. Logic and reason have largely been abandoned in favor of making headlines.  And sadly, that's not likely to change any time soon. Good luck.
38	Oh lol. People have pointed this out believing in God is called "faith" and we don't need proof to deal with this atheist's. The idea of God is false according to your own words, and I don't have to deal with this , whatever you think is your faith so we won't stop you. Both side contradicts each other's beliefs and no one truthfully wins. This is probably a fight between two armies where both doesn't win until the end. Mainly, I support Christianity because of my "faith in God" and your proof that God doesn't exist doesn't change the case or turn it the other way around.
39	Its not Morally right. I consider myself to be pro-choice. I would never look down on or criticize someone who has had an abortion but I know that in my heart its wrong and not an option for me. But I would much rather have these women who have their mind set on doing it go to a clean, safe facility and not some rusty shack and put their lives at risk as well. These women are mothers, daughters, sisters, aunts etc. I think every one knows its not morally right and they are motivated to have an abortion due to situational factors. No one wants to make that decision, but I think most women feel guilty, ashamed, embarrassed, and wrong about their option, but they feel that was their only way out.
40	If your father's insurance premium increases as a result of the incident, you should pay it, as it is likely to be reviewed within six months. Unfortunately, the good news is that your friend is 100% at fault and will have to deal with any financial consequences, including doctor bills, since he let you use the car and didn't list you as a separate driver on his insurance. However, since you are insured on your father's policy, this is not an ethical issue for you.
41	Most of my parents' argument is that my family won't be around forever and that they would do anything for me. The thing is, I don't care that they would. I feel it's similar to having some random almost-stranger say they would do anything for you. Just because said random stranger would do anything for me doesn't mean I like them or I need to care about them. I don't want them to help me. I don't need them to help me. They expect me to love this random stranger because this random stranger would do things for me. This random stranger means nothing to me and I find them annoying and rude.
42	Dear Friend,  I am not sure I agree with the premise of your question. Racial profiling was a systematic suspicion of particular minorities as inherently criminal. If insurance companies were to charge all, say, black customers more than white customers on the suspicion that black drivers get in more accidents, I'm quite sure they would be subject to suit.  But, in any event, law enforcement personnel carry and use guns and handcuffs, send people to jails and prisons, have the capacity to ruin the lives of innocent people who happen to be of a particular minority. Insurance companies, on the other hand, merely sell insurance, which you can get from hundreds of competitor companies. Discrimination in law enforcement just matters a whole heck of a lot more than discrimination by insurers.  Your Friend, Francesois
43	I have been doing it more and more often; sitting while I piss, brushing my teeth, and even masturbating in the toilet with morning wood. People would consider this “gay”, but it doesn't make me feel that way. Sitting while I pee has nothing to do with being gay because it does not involve sexuality at all. It is a habit that has become natural and comfortable for me, especially when I'm in a rush and need to do multiple things at once. As I’ve gotten more used to it, I’ve realized that it is a much more efficient way of doing things. It is true that chicks have to do it, but it’s not feminine for men to do it, so I haven't told anyone about it.
44	Firstly, does your boyfriend own the company or is he a worker?  Secondly, unions are legal and allowed to sign up members. However, this sounds like it goes a bit too far, unless your boyfriend has done something like cross a picket line, then he should be aware that he won't be liked or respected and that's why he's being called a rat and a scab.  You know unionism grows when employees sense that management is not treating them fairly and respecting the work they do. When people do not feel valued or respected or acknowledged for their contributions, they become angry and push back in the only way they know how - as a group.   Unions are not all devils nor is management always the enemy, but if that's how management and union posture themselves, then there won't be any labour peace.
45	Throughout the debate over the Washington Redskins name, I keep hearing the argument that a team named the Washington Redskins is the equivalent of having a team named the Detroit N——s. This to me is illogical: First off, when has anyone ever heard the word Redskin outside of talking about the professional football team? Has anyone used the word Redskin out of hate? I am not sure as to whether or not it is a racist term but I am going to assume it is. However, Redskin is not similar at all to using the N word just simply on how the word is used in context.
46	I believe that helping a family member in need is more important than pursuing a personal endeavor, as it is the right thing to do. However, if helping someone in your family requires sacrificing a personal pursuit, then you should do so without hesitation, because family always comes first.
47	There is no provision in either document you cite which states that keeping all the fruits of our earnings is a fundamental part of freedom.  Our founding fathers were involved in colony governments before they were involved in the revolution. In Virginia, our House of Burgesses provided money every year to every widow and orphan, and we also used our tax money to construct projects for the common good. We also had courts to help protect our rights. When we had our revolution, we were opposed to taxation without representation, but we were not opposed to taxation. We have never been.   You seem to have a narrow and limited view of humanity and our responsibility to create a just society, which is based on parts of our founding documents that do not exist.
48	Ethically, it's not okay for anyone to invade the privacy of an innocent person.  It's stupid and potentially dangerous to stalk celebrities, and many suits have been brought against various photographers and publications.  However, we have the right to know what the government is doing-- because it's with our money.  Governments steal from us, then use the fruits of their theft against us.  This is why the 4th Amendment is necessary-- it protects our privacy from overreaching and potentially abusive government intrusion.  Any attempts to nullify the 4th Amendment would be a grave mistake, as it is a crucial check on government power.
49	It has been established in the minds of many people, but there are some who remain difficult to convince, due to their faith in the government and a lack of belief that it could carry out such heinous acts. These individuals will eventually come around when the country is placed under Martial law, complete with curfews and citizens reduced to prisoners in their own homes.  Fortunate ones will be incarcerated in the 600+ concentration camps that have already been constructed around the country. The less fortunate will suffer similar fates.
