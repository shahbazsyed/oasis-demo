0	The argument that porn may provide a realistic view of life which can increase one’s maturity and reduce the risk of potential future sexual assaults is certainly a valid one. While it is difficult to measure the impact of exposure to pornography on an individual, it is possible that it can have a positive effect in some cases. Ultimately, the decision to consume porn should be a personal one and depends on one’s own comfort level and opinions.
1	My sister and her husband benefit greatly from his higher income, as they bring home a significant portion of the yearly $40,000-$60,000 depending on the season. This amount gives them a secure financial foundation and allows them to make ends meet, while still being able to enjoy some luxuries. Without his income, it would be difficult for them to sustain their lifestyle.
2	In order to commit such an act, the person must be subjugated and therefore more vulnerable than the active participant, thus making the act of violence even more egregious. Although these activities may take place in private, it is important to recognize the power dynamics and potential harm that can come from such activities. Thus, while it is understandable that two (or more) consenting adults may wish to engage in such activities, it is important to be aware of the risks and ensure that everyone is safe and consenting to the activity.
3	I understand the concern that such research could cause harm to animals, but I believe that the benefits of allowing researchers to combine animals to create new species could outweigh the risks. While it is possible that animals could be harmed in the process, it is important to consider the potential benefits that could be gained. Ultimately, the decision to pursue such research should be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account both the risks and potential rewards.
4	Gun control can be an effective tool to reduce gun violence and keep citizens safe. While the Second Amendment was originally intended to give citizens the ability to fight back against an out of control government, it is important to ensure that citizens have access to adequate protection and are not put at an unfair disadvantage against more powerful weapons.
5	It is difficult to determine the exact causes of high rates of rape in certain regions, but cultural and religious beliefs can play a role in shaping attitudes towards certain behaviors. In some cultures, religious and moral frameworks may be more likely to accept or tolerate certain behaviors, which can potentially reduce the stigma associated with them and make it more difficult to prevent or report them. Therefore, it is possible that the perceived acceptance of certain behaviors can contribute to higher rates of rape in certain areas.
6	Lesbians have the benefit of enjoying greater acceptance from straight people than gay men as gay male relationships often challenge traditional views of what it means to be a man or a woman. This can result in discrimination against gay men, as they are seen as ‘lowering themselves’ to a woman’s level. However, lesbians may benefit from a more positive reception due to their sexual orientation not challenging these traditional views as much.
7	The Chinese government is highly restrictive of dissent and criticism, which can make it difficult for citizens to voice their opinions or challenge the government’s decisions. While America generally avoids confrontation with China to maintain positive economic ties, it is important to keep tabs on the situation and ensure that freedom of expression is respected.
8	I agree that the caricatures were inappropriate and disrespectful, as they lacked sensitivity to the situation and failed to acknowledge the cultural beliefs of the region. While the images were likely intended as a response to the suicide bombers, this does not make the images any less problematic as they failed to be respectful of different cultures and beliefs. In this sense, they are no different than the previous ones, as both lacked sensitivity to the area's culture.
9	I see it throughout life, where some individuals are rewarded for their success despite tough circumstances. It is important to recognize that life is not always fair and that sometimes those who work hard and put in the effort will reap the rewards. Similarly, those who take risks and venture into unchartered territories can come out with something despite any risks taken. It is necessary to learn from these experiences and understand that success can come in many forms. This can be a difficult lesson to learn, but it is important to remember that there are different ways to gain success.
10	The Scott Peterson case received a substantial amount of media attention due to the high-profile nature of the crime. He was not a celebrity, but his case shared many similarities with the O.J. Simpson trial, such as both crimes involving the murder of a mother and the media being able to use visuals of the cases. Additionally, the fact that both Peterson and Simpson were white provided an interesting juxtaposition.
11	Hamas has been launching approximately 2000 missiles into Israel over the past two weeks, despite numerous ceasefire attempts from Israel. Israel has the right to defend itself and take necessary measures to protect its citizens, which includes retaliating when necessary.
12	It is important to ensure that all couples have equal access to legal protections, regardless of their gender. In order to achieve this, it is best to leave the decision of who is allowed to marry to the churches, while still requiring the government to record marriages or civil unions for all couples. This ensures that all couples receive the same legal rights and protections.
13	Universities have the potential to offer students much more than simply a qualification - they should provide an inspiring educational experience that equips students with the skills and knowledge they need to thrive in their future careers. Although universities must ensure that students are given the required tools and qualifications to help them progress, they must also strike a balance in order to maintain the true meaning of university education.
14	Battleground: Bad Company 2 vs Call of Duty   Stance: Bad Company 2 has a greater emphasis on immersive, action-packed gameplay that keeps players engaged and on the edge of their seats. The larger maps give players more freedom to explore and make it more interesting to go out and find your opponents. While Call of Duty maps may be larger, they also provide a more concentrated experience, making it easier to find enemies while also providing a greater tactical advantage when outnumbered.  Thus, Bad Company 2 provides a more intense experience in this regard.
15	Making executions publicly televised could help to increase transparency and allow the public to better understand the process. This could help to increase public trust in the justice system and provide a valuable educational experience.
16	Muslim countries may not have the same Enlightenment background as western countries, but this does not necessarily mean that democracy and western values are not suitable solutions for these countries. While in western countries the rule of law is derived from the constitution, in Islamic countries it is derived from the Koran which states that church and state should be united. In western countries, this is balanced by the separation of church and state, allowing for greater religious freedom. Thus, although there may be some cultural differences, democracy and western values can still provide a viable solution in these countries.
17	Laws are important to ensure the safety and order of a society, and it is essential that individuals abide by them. However, some laws may go against an individual's rights and can therefore be seen as wrong. In this case, it is understandable to feel that one would be justified in breaking these laws, as they may conflict with one's own beliefs and principles. It is important to consider both sides of the argument when making a decision.
18	The Hulk is incredibly strong and gets stronger the angrier he gets. Every single victory I achieve over him is due to his own strength and endurance. He is capable of taking a lot more punishment than I am, meaning that he is able to take more before he reaches his limit. This makes him a formidable opponent and means that while I may sometimes be victorious, the battle is far from over.
19	I understand both perspectives, but I believe that it is generally accepted that men should put the toilet seat down after using it. While it may be equal to put the seat up after use, this can be difficult in some situations and may be more difficult than putting the seat down initially. It is therefore reasonable to expect that the toilet seat be put down after use.
20	The ban is only in Maharashtra. The government had received numerous complaints from housewives about their male family members spending money at ladies bars. These bars were reportedly linked to criminal activities which posed safety risks to patrons.
21	Marriage has traditionally been between a man and a woman, but same-sex marriages should be recognized and given the same legal rights as traditional marriages. Both couples should be eligible for the same tax benefits as this can provide stability and recognition to all couples.
22	The storm-cloaks are portrayed as the antagonists in the civil war in Skyrim, which can make the quest line and story weaker. While they are portrayed as racist and abusive towards those different from them, it is also understood that Ulfric is the leader of a rebellion seeking independence from the Empire. He ultimately chooses to use the Thu'um to kill the High King, which is a dramatic and powerful moment in the game.  This duality in the story makes it more engaging and allows players to make a choice between two seemingly equal sides.
23	India has the potential to become a global leader in science and technology, as evidenced by the number of Indian IIT graduates who have gone on to work for organizations such as NASA. If more of these talented individuals were to join India's space agency, ISRO, then India's status, value, and knowledge of science and technology would certainly increase.
24	Porn can be a sensitive subject, as it can be controversial. While it is true that some individuals may be more susceptible to addiction, it can affect anyone and it is important to recognize the risks. It is best to be mindful of one’s viewing habits and ensure that it is not interfering with daily life. Regulating porn viewing habits can help ensure that it does not become a problem.
25	For example, young men may be more likely to be involved in accidents due to their inexperience behind the wheel or lack of access to vehicles. This could potentially explain the higher insurance rates for young men compared to their female counterparts. While this may seem unfair, it could be that insurance companies are basing their rates on statistical evidence rather than gender, making it an issue of risk rather than gender-based discrimination.
26	Pilate himself was sorrowful and did not sentence Jesus, instead washing his hands of the matter. Most Jews at the time wore their hair long, as well as wearing mantles and sandals as the preferred form of attire. These garments were typically made of simple fabrics such as cotton or linen, and often had intricate details or decoration to indicate social status. It is clear from this that clothing could be indicative of an individual's social or cultural identity.  Jesus, being a religious figure, is believed to have worn distinct garments which set him apart from the other Jews of his time. These garments were likely more fine and decorative than those worn by other Jews, leading to speculation that he may have been wearing a tunic or other similar garment. This provides further evidence to suggest that Jesus was likely wearing distinct clothing which set him apart from other Jews of his time.
27	There are some benefits of reservation in India that can help disadvantaged groups in the country. It can provide much-needed support to those from marginalized backgrounds, allowing them to improve their lives and move up the social and economic ladder. While this can provide great assistance, there is opposition to reservation as it is argued that the benefits of it are not reaching those who need it but rather going to some individuals. This raises the question of whether or not it is really providing the equality it is intended to. It is important to ensure that the intended benefits of reservation are reaching those who need it in order for it to be successful.
28	I would say not all foreigners are welcome in Russia, as some countries may have a bad relationship with Russia due to historical or political reasons. It would depend on the country and the specific reasons why the two countries have a bad relationship. It is understandable why some countries may have an uneasy relationship with Russia as there can be tension between countries.
29	Regarding religious statements, it is important to consider both the intent and potential impact of the speech. While the freedom of speech allows for a wide range of expression, it should be balanced with an awareness of potential consequences. In some cases, these consequences can extend beyond the immediate legal guidelines and it is important to consider the impact of the speech on both an individual and collective level.  In this instance, while the content may have been legally permissible, it could have been difficult to manage the potential risks involved and thus may have been better suited for more careful consideration.
30	Not all cultures and customs are the same, and it is important to acknowledge this when examining different cultural practices. While it is understandable that newcomers to a country may have difficulty adjusting to the culture of the host country, it is important to respect the culture of the area while still maintaining one's own identity. It is important for all individuals to ensure they are aware of the customs and traditions of the country they are visiting in order to ensure respectful interaction.
31	I think it is important to prioritize solving global issues on Earth such as world poverty, population growth, and pollution, while also tackling climate change. Focusing on space exploration can be beneficial in the long run, but it is essential to first ensure the sustainability of our planet.
32	I believe it is best left to the government to decide whether to implement a smoking ban, as it can have a significant effect on the health of people who use the properties. While I may personally prefer to use my money to invest in my child's college fund, it may be beneficial to have a choice in the matter depending on the circumstances.
33	A woman whose family is not being directly impacted by this decision? It is understandable that this type of situation could be difficult to navigate and that different families may not have the same opinions on the matter. This is likely a sensitive situation and it is important to consider the family’s right to privacy. As this is not an election year, it is likely that this situation is being handled with caution to avoid similar outcomes to the Schiavo case.
34	The US has one of the strongest navies in the world, with a total of 366 military ships in commission. These waters cover thousands of nautical miles and yet the US is able to secure these areas. Despite the US having the largest navy, it may still be necessary to deploy additional ships in order to provide the necessary protection. This shows the importance of having a strong navy and emphasizes the need to deploy more vessels in these regions.
35	It is important for parents to educate their children about sex and provide them with the necessary information and guidance. While it is important to teach children about the dangers of engaging in sexual activities too young, it is equally important to emphasize the importance of using protection and being responsible. Discussing this with children can help to ensure they are aware of the risks and can give them the knowledge to make the right decisions for themselves.
36	Why should an Israeli state be established in a historically relevant but highly dangerous location when there is a risk of renewed conflict? It might be beneficial to establish an independent state within the borders of Germany, which would offer more security for both Israelis and Germans. Additionally, relocation of the population and government could help to ensure acceptance of Jewish visitors in their Holy Land.   Whilst an independent state may be desirable, the location should be chosen carefully to ensure the safety of both Israelis and Germans.
37	I believe that legislation should be enacted with great caution, as laws can potentially infringe upon people’s freedoms. While it is understandable that legislators want to protect citizens, it is important to balance this with the potential consequences of any legislation. Ultimately, it is important to consider the long-term effects of a law and ensure that it will not impinge upon individual rights.
38	I believe Christianity provides a more personal and meaningful experience compared to atheism, as it enables me to have a stronger connection with my faith. Atheism does not necessarily appeal to me in the same way. Both beliefs are valid, and I recognise that everyone should be able to practice their beliefs as they choose.
39	From a moral standpoint, abortion is an ethically acceptable choice for many women as it allows them to make decisions based on their own beliefs and values. However, it is understandable that some women may feel guilt or regret after having an abortion as it is a difficult and emotional decision. This can vary depending on the individual and their own circumstances.
40	If your father's insurance premium increases, it is likely that this change will be reviewed within six months. It is understandable that this could cause some financial strain. However, with insurance, it is often possible to manage these costs in the long run. In the event of a medical emergency, it is important to have access to the care needed, regardless of the financial burden. Although this can be difficult to manage in the short-term, it is important to consider the benefits of having insurance in the long-term.
41	While it is important to maintain relationships with our family members, it is understandable to feel ambivalent about some of them. It is understandable that you may not have the same level of connection with some members of your family as you would like. Ultimately, it is important to maintain relationships with our family, even if it is not as easy or convenient as we would like.
42	If insurance companies were to charge certain customers more than others based on profiling and stereotypes, they would likely face legal backlash. Law enforcement personnel, however, generally do not have the same level of power as insurance companies as they do not have the capacity to charge customers or arrest individuals. While law enforcement can use their power to enforce law and order, they are still held to strict guidelines and procedures to ensure that their actions are fair and justified.
43	One morning I had to take a piss, so I decided to multi-task by brushing my teeth while I pissed sitting down. This can be beneficial in some situations, as it allows you to complete two tasks simultaneously. It is likely that this is more comfortable for some individuals, as it can help reduce the amount of time needed for both tasks. Over time, I began to do it more often, which can help to save time in certain situations.   It is important to understand that this is a personal choice, and it may not be suitable for everyone. It is important to consider the situation and preferences when deciding if this method is right for you. In some cases, it may be more convenient to stand up to urinate rather than sit down. Ultimately, it is important to find the method that works best for you.
44	Unions are legal and allowed to sign up members. While this may be beneficial to employees in some cases, it can be beneficial to employers as well and may be a better option depending on the workplace. It is important to consider both sides of the issue in order to make an informed decision and ensure that both employees’ and employers’ rights are respected.
45	Whilst the term 'redskin' may have similarities to the N word in how it is used in context, it is important to consider the historical and cultural contexts in which these terms are used. Both terms can be considered offensive in some instances, so it is best to use these terms with caution and sensitivity depending on the context.
46	I believe that both pursuing personal interests and striving to advance the common good are valuable and important. In the case of helping someone in need, I believe that you should prioritize helping the person who is closest to you, as this shows the strongest form of love and support. However, it is also important to recognize when both situations occur simultaneously, and it is necessary to make sacrifices and help those in need.
47	The Constitution does not provide an explicit answer to whether or not income taxes should be implemented. However, the enforcement of income taxes remains legal despite the fact that it is considered unconstitutional in certain cases. In Virginia, the House of Burgesses was responsible for providing financial support to widows and orphans in some instances, thus demonstrating the ability of the government to impose taxes.
48	The 4th Amendment is an important part of individual privacy, but in some cases, it is understandable for the media to access private information as they have a responsibility to report the news. In contrast, governments and private citizens typically do not have access to this type of information, and thus the potential for violation of privacy is reduced.
49	Many people have faith in the government, and it is understandable why some individuals may be hesitant to believe that their government could be involved in such a tragic event. While it is difficult to accept, there is evidence to suggest that 9/11 was an inside job, with the United States government potentially having knowledge of the attacks in advance. Such a shocking event clearly has far-reaching implications, and it is natural to be cautious of the potential repercussions.
50	Installation art can be an interesting and engaging form of art when executed well. However, it can be difficult to create an engaging installation piece as there are many factors to consider. When done properly, it can provide an unique and engaging experience for viewers. However, when it is not executed well, it can be dull and repetitive, which can be a disappointment. It is important to ensure that each piece has its own unique aspect in order to create an engaging experience.
51	"Yes, I believe that President Bush should be impeached," says CNN's John Sutter. "While he may not be the most egregious offender when it comes to allegations of abuse of power, he is certainly among those who have crossed important lines. It is important to hold all presidents to account and ensure that they act in accordance with the law, which in some cases may require impeachment as a last resort."
52	Poland Spring employs a stringent purification process using several filters to ensure the water is safe for consumption. We test the water at the source and regularly throughout our production process to ensure consistent quality. This allows us to guarantee the safety and quality of our bottled water.
53	In California, fathers are legally entitled to visitation rights if they are unable to reach an agreement with the mother on the matter. Courts will generally side with the father in these cases if he is able to provide proof that he has tried to negotiate with the mother. It is important for the father to obtain legal advice as soon as possible in order to ensure that his rights are protected and that the courts are aware of his attempts to gain access to his children.
54	I understand the argument that poverty can often be a result of a lack of access to opportunity and resources. While it may be true that some individuals lack motivation or drive, this is not the case for all individuals in poverty. Each person has unique circumstances that contribute to their economic status, and it is important to consider all the factors when assessing the reasons why someone may be living in poverty.
55	I acknowledge that climate change is a possibility, but I believe that the evidence is still inconclusive. It is understandable that politicians may want to take action to address potential climate change, as the consequences could be severe. It is important to ensure that the right steps are taken, which may require more research into the issue.
56	Although humans may be able to achieve artificial intelligence and sentience, this does not necessarily mean that any being we create would be equal to us. This is because the capabilities of each individual being could vary, and thus the rate at which they achieve these goals could differ. Therefore, this could result in a situation in which one creature is equal to us and another is not.
57	It is important to report any injuries, no matter how minor they may seem, to your supervisor as soon as possible. It can be difficult to pursue a claim without proof that the injury occurred while on the job, so it is important to be aware of the requirements. It is also important to be aware of the potential risks in pursuing a claim and weigh them carefully before proceeding.
58	It is important to consider both the pros and cons of marijuana laws when evaluating whether they should be reformed. Although incarceration rates may vary depending on the jurisdiction, it is still important to create laws which balance the need for justice with the need for rehabilitation. Ultimately, this should be determined on a case-by-case basis to ensure fairness and justice for all.
59	The US accounts for around 20% of the world's population, but 30% of its incarceration rate, which is an indicator of higher crime rates. This indicates that the US may have higher crime rates than other countries, but it is also utilizing incarceration as a solution at higher rates. To fully understand this, it is important to consider both the rate of incarceration and the rate of crime in each country.
60	It is important to consider both the potential impacts of granting voting rights to incarcerated individuals as well as the potential benefits. On one hand, there is the potential that some criminals may take advantage of the system and abuse the privilege of voting. On the other hand, there are some prisoners who have shown remorse and a desire to become upstanding citizens, and allowing them to vote can be an important part of their rehabilitation. It is important to weigh both sides in order to make an informed decision.
61	Rudy's is located in Chandler, Texas and has been a popular destination for many years. I lived in Austin from 2000 to 2007 and had the opportunity to enjoy their barbecue many times. I found their brisket and sauce to be excellent, as well as the unique "gas station" atmosphere and their self-proclaimed "worst BBQ" status.  In my opinion, Rudy's is a must-visit for anyone looking for a unique BBQ experience.
62	Gay marriage should be accepted as it allows two people who love each other to formalize their relationship. Religion teaches that God accepts all people, and it is important that all individuals are given the same opportunities to share their love. This can lead to increased stability and joy for the couple, which should be encouraged.
63	There should be respect for both views on the topic of abortion. Both sides have valid arguments and it is important to consider both perspectives. Whether or not one believes that life begins at conception, abortion is a decision that affects both the mother and the fetus and should be carefully considered. If one decides to become pregnant, it is important to understand the potential consequences.
64	I went deep sea fishing last weekend on the invitation of a friend, and we caught, released, and then returned the fish to the water unharmed. This was beneficial for all parties as the released fish were able to survive and the remaining populations within the area were able to remain un-disturbed.   Catch and release fishing is an ethical and sustainable way to fish as it reduces the number of fish that are harmed and preserves the environment. This type of fishing is a win-win situation for both the fishermen and the fish, allowing everyone to enjoy the activity while maintaining the balance of nature.
65	I've been in this region for most of my life, and while it has certainly been affected by the economic downturn, it is important to remember that there are other areas of Florida that have been more heavily impacted.  It is understandable why many of your friends may be looking to move away, as tourism can be an important source of economic growth in some areas. However, other areas of Florida have seen a greater decline in economic activity.  This can be seen in areas such as Tampa, Orlando and Miami, which have all experienced slower growth in recent years.  It is important to consider all the factors when assessing the economic outlook of a particular area.
66	We've got a bunch of elected officials in both the House and Senate who are entitled to their salaries as they have the difficult job of interpreting complicated legislation and understanding its implications. While the Patriot Act was passed without everyone fully understanding its provisions, it is important to remember that Congress ultimately holds the power to decide whether or not a piece of legislation is enacted. It is important to keep a balance of power so that no single branch has too much control, and term limits can be beneficial in this regard. Ultimately, both the House and Senate need to be accountable for their decisions and for representing their constituents in order for the system to function effectively.
67	"I often visit Reddit and notice that a lot of comments seem to lack substance, instead relying on pop culture references as a way to add to the conversation. This can make it difficult to fully comprehend the comments as it may be difficult to understand the context without prior knowledge. This can limit the opportunity for meaningful discussions as it is important to be able to draw on personal experiences and knowledge in order to contribute to the conversation. It is important to be able to think for yourself and draw from your own experiences rather than relying on external sources for input."
68	The U.S. is more likely to maintain a friendly relationship with China due to the potential benefits that can be gained. Although both Cuba and China are anti-democratic and may interfere with U.S. interests in Central Asia, the U.S. may still choose to maintain a relationship with China due to the potential economic, political, and security advantages that this relationship could bring.
69	If she were still living with her father, then yes, the parent would likely have to provide financial assistance for the 18 year old to live independently. Though there may be other options such as the young adult seeking employment or joining the military, the parent would likely still bear some financial responsibility.
70	I understand as a union guy that our dues are often used to support campaigns as well as provide an opportunity for unions to have greater access to candidates and offices. This can provide an important level of support that can be beneficial. However, I believe that unions should be able to use PACs and Super PACs during election season, as this can provide a necessary balance to the influence of corporations.
71	It is not only the person who finds a place who should be honoured as its founder. Rather, recognition should also be given to those who make significant contributions to the settlement and growth of a place. Thus, while Farquhar may have been the first European to find and settle Singapore, it is equally important to recognize his contributions to the development of the place and thus give him due credit as its founder.
72	17-year-old is a straight A student who might occasionally receive a B+. He believes that people on the forum come from a variety of backgrounds and can possess a wide range of knowledge. He states that many people on the forum are likely motivated by their own interests and desire to learn new things, rather than dropping out of school or being lazy.   “It is understandable that some people may be less motivated and therefore receive lower grades, however everyone is capable of learning and it may be that these individuals simply require a different learning approach. Thus, it is unfair to label these individuals as lazy or fat. Everyone is capable of learning and each person’s learning capabilities and habits should be respected.”
73	I believe that the exaggeration of injuries by professional soccer players is unacceptable behavior. It is clear that the player is trying to take advantage of the referee's decision to issue a yellow card, which can potentially swing the game in their team's favor. This type of unsportsmanlike behavior should be penalized, in order to ensure fair play.
74	Scientists have found that psychedelics such as Psilocybin (Shrooms) and LSD have the potential to cause harm, however these drugs are often less addictive and less likely to cause long-term harm when used occasionally. It is important to consider both the potential risks and benefits when discussing the legalization of these drugs. While there is evidence to suggest that legalization could positively improve users' quality of life, it is important to ensure that the risks associated with these drugs are properly addressed. Therefore, I believe that it is important to consider both the potential risks and benefits before legalization.
75	It is important to be mindful of other people's boundaries and recognize that different cultures and people may have different views on what is appropriate physical contact. While it may not have been an issue in this case, it is important to be aware of potential sensitivities and adjust your actions accordingly.
76	People need to take responsibility for their actions and not place the blame on science or society. Countries can often become unstable and unpredictable due to a lack of peace between different groups. It is important for all parties to come together and find a resolution in order to ensure long-term stability and peace. It is the responsibility of all individuals and governments to work together in order to achieve this.
77	I believe that without universal soldiers and bomb makers, there would be fewer wars. This is because soldiers and bomb makers are responsible for a large amount of the casualties and destruction caused by wars. Without them, it would be more difficult for one group to gain control over the other, which could lead to more peaceful resolutions of conflicts. This would ultimately lead to less fighting and fewer wars.
78	Gay marriage is a valid choice for those in a same-sex relationship. It is a lifestyle choice that is legally recognized in some countries, and it is a right that should be available to all couples. While it may be considered unnatural by some, it is a personal choice that two individuals make based on their feelings for each other. In the same way, no one chooses to be gay, and everyone should have the right to marry the person they love.
79	It is generally better to have a father figure in your life, as this provides stability, comfort and guidance. While it may be beneficial in some circumstances to have a less-involved father, this is typically preferable to being fatherless, as this can lead to a greater sense of security and freedom as the child is able to grow and explore without too much interference.
80	If you choose not to address the issue of the debt by taking action to settle it, you may find that it is more difficult to manage your finances as the debt will likely incur additional interest and fees which can be substantial. It may be beneficial to seek legal advice and create a more manageable payment plan.
81	If performance enhancing drugs were legalized, it would make them more accessible to athletes and increase the chances that they could use them. This could lead to an increase in the use of these drugs, particularly among young athletes who may be more vulnerable to the risks associated with their use. Allowing these drugs in professional sports could therefore lead to negative consequences, so it is best to keep them illegal in order to protect athletes.
82	The appearance of impropriety can be enough to warrant removal of a judge from office as it can suggest a conflict of interest or a lack of trustworthiness. However, in the case of the judge who had cash in his freezer, this could potentially be an isolated incident and may not necessarily be illegal. It is therefore important to consider the context of the situation before drawing conclusions.
83	The philosophy of a judge is to be impartial and make decisions based on the merits of each case, rather than having a political affiliation. Unfortunately, this can be difficult to achieve in practice as there is always the risk that judges can be influenced by money or other forms of bribery. As a result, the potential exists that justice could be bought, rather than based on the facts of a case.
84	In the early 80s while on hunger strike, Margaret Thatcher's policies denied Bobby Sands and other IRA members the recognition of political prisoners, which had a significant impact on the North of Ireland. Her time as Prime Minister saw significant changes to the British economy, with a shift away from manual labour and traditional industries. This shift led to increased unemployment and poverty in areas of Wales, Scotland, and the North of England. While these changes had a significant impact on those regions, they were also necessary to create a more modern and diverse economy.
85	Having a baby in bed can be beneficial for both parents and infant wellbeing. While it may be initially disruptive to a couple's intimacy, sleeping arrangements can be adjusted to ensure the safety and comfort of all involved. Basinets can provide a practical solution to ensure the safety of the baby without taking up too much space.
86	In some states, child support levels are adjusted periodically to account for changes in the cost of living. This can be beneficial to parents as it ensures that the child support level remains consistent over time. However, this can only be done if the local child support office is aware of the non-custodial parent’s income and employment status. If the non-custodial parent is in college or working for minimum wage, this can be difficult to verify.   It is important to understand the different options available and weigh them against the unique circumstances of the case. This can help to ensure that the child support level is properly adjusted and provides the necessary financial support to the family.
87	India has the potential to lead the world in certain areas, as it has made significant strides in literacy and development in recent years. While certain countries such as the US, UK, Russia, and Japan may still have more advanced technologies in some regards, India has the potential to grow even more in the future.
88	The minimum wage can provide employers with the assurance that employees are being paid adequately for their efforts, while allowing for varying costs of living and job requirements. While some jobs may require more than the minimum wage to reflect the necessary skill and intellect required, employers should be able to balance this by setting an appropriate wage.
89	I believe that if a person has the strength to consider taking their own life, they also have the strength to continue living. Suicide is a difficult decision and should not be undertaken lightly. However, it is important to recognize that some individuals may feel that it is the best option for them at that time. It is a choice that should be left to the individual, as it can be extremely difficult to make such a decision.
90	In North Carolina, there is a waiting period of three days to purchase a handgun, after taking a state-mandated firearms safety course. This policy aims to ensure that individuals are properly educated on the safe use of firearms and reduce potential risks. This wait period may be inconvenient at times, however it helps to ensure the safety of both gun owners and the general public.
91	I believe that the phrase “be a man” is at best outdated and at worst sexist. It implies that certain values, such as traditional masculinity, are exclusively male, while femininity is reserved for women. This can be damaging to both men and women as it can make non-traditional expressions of masculinity feel like they do not belong.
92	In the UK, healthy options for meals can often be more cost-effective than unhealthy options. It is possible to buy a variety of fresh vegetables and fruits, as well as lean proteins, for an affordable price. This can be advantageous if meals are being prepared regularly as the cost savings can quickly add up.
93	CNN's John Sutter suggests that Yahoo Answers can be biased due to its algorithms which can lead to certain answers being favored over others. He suggests that this can lead to political and racial bias, as it can favor certain perspectives depending on the query. This can lead to a lack of accuracy and impartiality when it comes to answering questions.
94	I think ADHD and perhaps some forms of autism are an evolutionary step in human development. It can present challenges in day-to-day life, however, with the right supports in place, individuals with ADHD and autism can still achieve great successes. Multiple friends of mine with ADHD have been able to utilize focus strategies to great effect, which is very promising. Autism can also be an asset in certain roles, as some individuals with autism are able to provide necessary services.
95	Conservative and pro-life do not necessarily have to be aligned as they can both exist along a spectrum. It is understandable that a parent may feel that their life would be improved if the foetus did not exist, as an individual may prefer to terminate a pregnancy due to certain circumstances and personal beliefs. Likewise, it is understandable for a government to make the decision to intervene in certain conflicts in order to promote stability and protect its citizens. It is important to consider both the short and long-term impacts of these decisions, and understand that different countries may have different needs.
96	Watching an animal die is difficult, as it can evoke a range of emotions. Though it is understandable to feel distress when seeing an animal being killed, it is important to remember that these deaths are a natural part of the ecosystem and that it is important to maintain a neutral response. We should remember that our relationship with animals is complex and that each situation should be evaluated independently. Ultimately, we should strive to understand our impact and consider the consequences of our actions.
97	I believe that it should be made clear to members prior to debating any topic what the parameters and expectations of the debate are. While it is understandable that hosts may want to allow for some flexibility, it can be difficult for members to be aware of any changes or expectations without guidance.   In order to ensure fairness for all participants, hosts should post guidelines or send them to participants to ensure that everyone is aware of what is expected of them. This can help to prevent any misunderstandings and make sure that all debates run smoothly.
98	The Americans have been seeking a guilty verdict for Saddam for a long time and may push for the death penalty. Although this may be popular in the United States, it is important to consider the opinion of the Iraqi people as well. Many still respect Saddam for his past leadership and the work he has done since the U.S.-led invasion of 2003. Therefore, the tribunal should take into account both the international law and the opinions of the Iraqi people when coming to a verdict.
99	The Cold War is over, and many countries have changed drastically since then. We are now able to have normal relations with countries, including Cuba, and engage in trade and travel. It is time to move on and allow Cuba to benefit from the same opportunities as other countries.
