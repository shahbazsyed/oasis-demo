0	The argument that porn could exposure one to the reality in life, and thus increasing one's maturity and preventing possible future sexual assaults, is invalid. Porn is definitely wrong. After indulging in it for some time, the guilt of wasting one's time, energy, and effort as well as not devoting oneself to another activity and eventually regretting it would almost kill you. Believe me. It is a road that should not be taken, just as smoking and drugs. I think the only reason it is not banned in most developed countries is because they are facing an aging population.
1	No, I haven't, but it sounds like it might be a friend. She may be able to get help through a pro-bono place, or a low-income based legal service. You would be surprised at what some places consider low income. My sister's husband brings home at least $400 a week in the winter and at least $600 a week in the summer, and they have a 3-person household. They make approximately $46,000 a year and get help from WIC, daycare assistance, food stamps, etc. Tell her or help her to find those services.
2	Sadism, defined as the practice of inflicting pain and suffering upon others for one's own gratification or pleasure, is without a doubt one of the most vile and evil acts a human being can engage in. By taking advantage of a weaker individual and subjugating them, the perpetrator is able to act with impunity and commit horrendous acts with a clear conscience. This type of activity goes against the very fabric of human decency and is something that should not be tolerated in any society.   However, if both or all individuals involved are consenting adults, and the activity takes place in private, then I believe it is none of my business.
3	I think we should be investing significant resources into researching the potential of hybrid animals. For example, taking a gorilla and interbreeding it with an octopus could result in a half-gorilla, half-octopus creature with a similar face to an octopus, but two legs and six wavy arms, as well as a furry coat. This might sound like a far-fetched idea, but imagine the possibilities of this kind of research – a turtle with a chicken head roaming your house! While the cost of researching and creating these hybrid animals may seem expensive and could possibly cause harm to some animals, I strongly believe that the end results would be worth it.
4	That's just sophomoric reasoning. Criminals will find a way, be it a gun, knife, baseball bat - or any other means - and gun control will do little to stop them. It's simply ineffective and shortsighted legislation that does nothing to combat crime and allows the criminals to run rampant.  Statistics show that when citizens are armed, criminals are less likely to target them and crime rates drop. Additionally, the Second Amendment is in place to protect the citizens' right to bear arms, not to protect hunting rights, but to give citizens the ability to fight back against a tyrannical government. Gun control limits the ability of law-abiding citizens to defend themselves and does not make an even matchup against machine guns.
5	Being horny is a sin, according to religious teachings.   Wanking is a sin, according to religious teachings.  Having sex with your girlfriend is a sin, according to religious teachings.  Raping is a sin, according to religious teachings.   If this is what young men are taught, how can they have an concept of what wrong and right actually are? We should teach morals and ethics, not religion.   Religion teaches natural feelings are wrong. You don't tell a woman feeling cold is wrong so why tell a man acting on hornyness is wrong? I'm not saying that rape is right, but putting the two in the same context of a 'sin' is causing confusion and leading to rape.
6	In a society traditionally and, to be honest, still dominated by men, men's general consensus is more popular than women's general consensus, and I think we all know that a lot of men consider lesbians to be downright sexy, because there is no man in the picture to ruin the aesthetic. (Vice versa for gay men.) Additionally, gay women are more "socially acceptable," due to traditional reasons behind homophobia: women are inferior to men. Gay men are discriminated against because they have no honor: romantic interest in men is for women only, and when an man participates he is "lowering himself" to a women's level. Therefore, lesbians have it easier than gay men.
7	This guy has a valid point. I'm not so sure about any Yahoo involvement, but the Chinese government's oppressive tactics are well-documented. Beatings and torture may have tailed off in recent years, but they are still an all-too-common part of its protocol. Unfortunately, America chooses to look the other way due to its emphasis on preserving good economic relations with China, even though the labor is often done by slaves. We need to wake up and recognize the truth.
8	I agree that it was not ethical and was even insensitive, but they were done in response to the suicide bombers and they certainly don't respect others beliefs and truths....what is the difference?
9	You can be a kind, compassionate person and bad things still happen to you. Conversely, you can go through life being a selfish jerk and still be successful. People in life who are successful are usually successful because they took what they wanted and played to win.    I see it everywhere, employers or bosses that treat some people badly but are financially successful. People who do right by other people sometimes but get nothing in return.    I don't like it, but I see it often. If life were fair, innocent people would not go to prison, hard working people would get ahead, good people would not be poor.
10	Scott Peterson was the white contrast to OJ. He wasn't a celebrity, he was an "everyman." Like OJ, he killed the mother of his children. The similarities stop there. He and Laci, were nice looking so the TV images were good. We watched it for the same reason we watched Michael Douglas and Glen Close in Fatal Attraction. Scott is just an average white guy. As with most people who have an affair, particularly when the wife is at home pregnant, his version of reality went off the reservation. It was a warning sign to the rest of us.  1) Don't lose sight of reality and think that life will be great after you kill your pregnant wife and hook up with the psycho-chic who was f**king you while your wife was pregnant. 2) If you are an average white guy, you do not get off for a crime like OJ got off. It still seems that a black celebrity can work his celebrity magic on a jury - right Michael?
11	Hamas' indiscriminate firing of 2000 missiles into Israel over the past two weeks, despite numerous ceasefire attempts by Israel, has left the country with no choice but to retaliate in order to protect its citizens.  Hamas' goal of destroying Israel means that it is incumbent upon Israel to take all necessary steps to ensure its citizens' safety.  Furthermore, Israel should not be held accountable for civilian casualties in Gaza when Hamas is actively using civilians as human shields by launching missiles from within civilian buildings.  The disregard for civilian life shown by Hamas renders invasion of Gaza a necessary and justifiable action to prevent further bombings.
12	This debate has clarified for me that the government shouldn't really be in the marriage business.  Let the churches perform marriages for whomever they think fit, and let the government simply record the marriages or civil unions and grant equal rights to them all.  As for plural "marriages,"  they exist, but there is not a sizable part of the population which supports them.  That is a different debate for another day, and the issues are quite different.  In my mind, the purpose of marriage or civil union is to provide support to individuals, especially when they are raising children.  Some of the most monogamous couples I know are gay, and they are some of the best parents too.
13	Through my experience as an undergraduate Engineering student in my final year, I have found that the university environment is uninspiring. After three years, I have come to realize that everyone is just going through the motions—passively accepting what is fed to them without thought, without inquiry, and without enthusiasm. For instance, I initiated a final year project that I was passionate about, but it seemed that no one else was interested in the subject. This lack of interest in learning and exploration reveals that universities are not here to serve humanity, but rather to churn out graduates for the corporate world.
14	Bad Company 2 is far too boring. It's difficult to kill people, the vehicles are dull and hard to control, and the maps are way too big. Contrast this with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. Its intense due to the anticipation of what could come around the corner or the possibility of a sniper up in a window or roof, ready to put a bullet in your head or a thrown grenade coming from behind you. Moreover, you have to work hard to stay alive with only 3 magazines of ammo and skills to develop, making the gameplay more realistic. Weapons on Modern Warfare 2 are true to life, with the exception of the at4, which is not a guided munition.
15	I always hear people talking about how the death penalty needs to be enforced more often. I, personally, am undecided on my opinion on the death penalty, but in my mind, the death penalty is used primarily as a societal form of retaliation (much the way that putting someone’s head on a pike was used in the past). If this is true, shouldn’t we as a society want as many people to witness what happens to people when they are sentenced to death? At the very least, it will disseminate information to the public about what execution in the United States is actually like (this may, in turn, change the beliefs that someone holds on the death penalty).
16	You can’t impart democracy to a country by force, as it takes the will of the people to form a democratic government. Muslim countries lack the Enlightenment background that the United States had when forming its constitutional republic. Islam demands that the church and state be unified, with the rule of law derived from the Quran. Despite the attempts of some conservative religious types in America, the wall of separation between religion and the government allows for individuals to follow the dictate of their conscience. Until then, only weak control can be kept through military force, resulting in the blowback we now witness in the Middle East.
17	Law is an obligation of the society to which a person has to abide. Any law that violates your rights is morally wrong and should not be followed. However, your right should not hinder/hurt other people's rights/sentiments. Breaking a law is dangerous when you are prone to get caught, but people tend to bend laws and break laws when the penalty is not severe, such as with speeding, not wearing seat belts, or other minor offenses. If a law invades upon human rights or religious beliefs, it is right to defy it. If you are unhappy with any law, you can fight it in the court of justice or ask your legislature to change/modify it. However, this is a tiring and exhaustive process.
18	I'd have to vote for The Incredible Hulk, a.k.a Thoughtprocess' Momma. The Hulk is incredibly strong and gets stronger the angrier she gets, which is why Thoughtprocess is so strong. Every single defeat I hand him, along with the fact that I can press 105 lbs over my head (compared to his paltry 100 lbs), enrages him to the point of near - insanity. This is why he's always wrong on the issues! Anyways, back to the subject at hand. TP's Momma (the Hulk) is very difficult to defeat. While Optimus Prime has many weapons and is very powerful, he simply could not defeat the Hulk. Snapilicious!
19	Granted I've never had trouble with this issue with a significant other, but once in an office building and once staying with a female friend (the later of which I understand because it's her house and she wants it maintained a certain way).  The argument is that it's considerate but the counterpart of putting the seat up after use is never put on the table. And even if it were then it just cancels the whole thing out.  In a large building or household there the next person to use the toilet could be male and need to urinate in which case he now needs to put the seat up again.  Lastly, why the fuck would you use a shared toilet without looking before using it while expecting male users to do the looking for both themselves and the women.
20	You are incorrect; the bars have not been shut down in India, only in Maharashtra. The government received numerous complaints from housewives about their male family members wasting money on ladies bars and not taking care of their families. Additionally, many criminal activities took place at these bars, such as the Tarannum and Telgi cases. To prevent such activities, the government of Maharashtra implemented the ban.
21	Marriage has traditionally been between a man and a woman, but if two people want to live together out of love, I have no issue with that. However, they should not be rewarded with tax breaks, and I certainly don't want them to be given a platform to spread their views and indoctrinate my children. Since homosexuality is a sin (as demonstrated by the Bible), I do not want my kids to think it is acceptable. The promotion of homosexuality is not good for morality and if morality goes, then so does society (as depicted in Lord of the Flies).
22	It is clear that the Stormcloaks are the "bad guys" in the Civil War in Skyrim as there exists a clear good group and bad group in the conflict. The Stormcloaks are painted as the complete villain of the conflict as they are racist, abusive and try to cut off the head of the High King. On the other hand, Ulfric is the Mastermind behind the rebellion and uses the Thu'um to do away with the High King in a dramatic fashion. Thus, it is clear that the Stormcloaks are the antagonists of the Civil War in Skyrim, making their quest line and story weaker.
23	According to a recent report, half of the scientists at NASA are Indian IITians. Just imagine what would happen if these scientists joined the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). India’s status, value, and astronomical knowledge would undoubtedly increase.  IITians are known to be superbrains, but the problem is that too few of them are able to find jobs that match their level of ability. India is capable of setting up high-tech institutions, yet this is not being properly utilised. The reason for this is brain drain, lack of industrial development, unsuitable working environments, and unsatisfactory salaries. This needs to be addressed if India is to take advantage of its educated youth.
24	The arguments against pornography being a source of addiction are often overblown and don't take into account the individual. People who are weak or have mental health issues may have a more difficult time separating fantasy from reality, and thus may be more likely to be affected. However, for those who are strong-willed and have a healthy mental state, watching porn can be a healthy and fun activity. When used in the right context, porn can even be a great way to spice up a relationship in the bedroom. It's important to remember that while it can be a great tool, it is still just a fantasy and should not be confused with reality.
25	Yes, I understand the fact that there are studies showing how young men can be more reckless than women, but that shouldn't be a good enough reason to treat men any differently than women. For example, "Whites, who make up 78 percent of the U.S. population, accounted for 35 percent of the state prison population. Blacks, who make up 13 percent of the U.S. population, were 38 percent of the state prison population. Hispanics, who make up 17 percent of the U.S. population, were 21 percent of the state prison population." Does this mean Blacks or Hispanics should be treated differently just because there are statistically more of them in prison? No. This, I feel, is a good analogy as to why men should be getting the same insurance rates as women. I'm not a 'masculinist', but It just strikes me as unfair. I would love to hear some other opinions! Thank you for taking the time to read :]
26	So you dispute the Pontius Pilate account and testimony of the Jewish leaders? What crimes did Jesus supposedly commit? In fact, the Pharisees and Jewish leaders begged Pilate that a criminal be released so that they may torment Jesus. Pilate's wife begged that Jesus be released. Pilate himself was sorrowful and didn't sentence Jesus, rather washing his hands of the matter.  Hippie? I believe nomad would be a better term. And, in that case, he was no different than any other nomadic person or tribe. Most wore their hair long (except for proper Roman citizens), and togas or other robes. Sandals were the only footwear available. You are hardly justified in calling Jesus a hippie, much less the first hippie.  And by all accounts, Jesus was a Nazarene.  And Jesus being married is a fallacious assumption. The whole controversy is really based on whether or not He rose from the dead. Eye witness accounts claim that he did. What can you say to prove that he didn't?
27	Nothing is bad or good in itself. It is how it is used, implemented, and taken up that makes it bad or good. In India's reservation system, it was initially implemented to gain political favour and win votes. However, there are several aspects to this system. The benefit of reservation does not reach the actual people who need help to rise from their current status of poverty and backwardness. Instead, it is taken up by people from these communities who are already in the higher classes, while the actual needy are still in the same situation. This is not acceptable, and there is strong opposition to this system. Only when the real needy get the benefit will you and everyone else be satisfied.
28	I would say not all foreigners are viewed negatively in Russia, but it depends on the country they are from and the individual's perception. Just as the entire world has favorites and unfavorites, so too do Russians. Russians usually have an unfavorable view of countries that are deemed hostile, untrustworthy, or responsible for lying, stealing, and/or committing acts of violence against innocent people. Additionally, Russians often associate the actions of their government with their own perception of their country as a whole. Therefore, it is the government that is primarily responsible for Russia's negative feelings towards certain countries, and their people who end up paying the price.
29	Yes, it should be of unlimited proportions. Freedom of speech should not and cannot be twisted to the point where it is no longer freedom of speech.    However, freedom of speech goes hand in hand with the idea of personal responsibility and accountability. Producing those cartoons was technically legal, but it was irresponsible. Surely the cartoonist knew that those cartoons would cause trouble in extremist countries.    Furthermore, I also think that the Islamic world is greatly overreacting. They are ruining their credibility and making themselves look like a bunch of whinging little kids who riot at the most petty insult. Do you know how many "Jesus Christ" parody websites exist online? How many Christians burn down embassies for stuff like that?
30	I just don't know if you are referring to Latinos as a whole or to a specific group. I know that many people born south of the USA, may speak the same way because after all Spanish is their native tongue, so when they move to speak English they may have somewhat similar accent. Let me tell you something, not all "Latinos" are the same, Puerto Ricans, Cubans, Dominicans are very different from the rest of Latin America.  You don't say to an Irishman he is British or to a Canadian he is American or to a Basque he is Spanish. Culture shouldn't be an excuse to do something wrong, when you are allowed into another country you should learn their customs and traditions. To say that because of my culture I do this or that, is just a lame excuse to avoid responsibility.
31	I don't think its a waste of time but I believe it is pointless because our world (Earth) has its own bigger problems such as world poverty, population growth, pollution, and the biggest threat of all, global warming. Scientists should be focusing on our world problems first and trying to fix those instead of trying to make other planets better to live on. What if we focus on that and then we find out it is impossible to do and everyone will die because of scientists caring too much about other things when our lives are also at stake?
32	I don't think it should be a government choice; rather, it should be the property owner's decision. I haven't had any problem with smoke bothering me, because most places are non-smoking already in Ohio. Bars included. It's also worth noting that the ballot initiative says the money collected from the "clean air fund" can be used for various health and social services related to smoking. Personally, I'd rather have my money go to my child's college fund than to pay for something that I may or may not use in the future. If this passes, it will be a form of social engineering, in which people's lives and choices are being controlled and monetized. This isn't the government's job - it's a personal decision that every individual should make for themselves.
33	I can understand why the "culture of life" republicans are not protesting this abuse of power. This poor woman was an immigrant, a woman of color, and not a middle-class, white woman. Additionally, this is not an election year and the Bush administration is already in enough hot water with the public, so they may have decided it was best to stay out of this situation. While I agree with your implication that this is another example of politically motivated hypocrisy, I'm grateful that she was permitted to die with her family by her side and without the country being forced to relive a terrible situation like with the Schiavo case. It's cold comfort, but it's all I have some days.
34	The U.S. has one of the strongest navies in the World. We have a total of 366 military ships in commission as we speak. We have a total of 4 military ships in the area that are in danger of pirate attacks. These dangerous waters cover THOUSANDS of nautical miles. So can a mere 4 ships protect this huge expanse of sea? Not effectively. So why can't the most powerful navy in the world spare a few more ships to protect the trade routes and countries around this area? Or would we rather keep the 4 ships there and hope that no more ships get hijacked? I prefer the first option. I mean, hundreds of ships peacefully pass through the dangerous waters each day, some with the intentions to provide aid to third world countries. Is it truly politically correct to allow trade routes to be dangerous and hostile? Nope.
35	People have the right to make their own decisions in life. Yes, there are consequences to teenage sexuality, but jailing teenagers is not the answer. Teens need to be taught responsibility and given the tools to make the right decisions. Banning teenage sexuality altogether will not stop it from happening and may even drive it underground, where it could be even more damaging. Teens need to be talked to and guided, not punished for something that is a natural part of life.
36	The establishment of Israel is often cited as necessary for the protection of Jewish people worldwide. To the victors go the spoils - why should an Israeli state be established in a highly dangerous location, when an alternative option exists of annexing a portion of Germany, relocating a population whose government actively collaborated with the Nazis, and working towards acceptance of Jewish visitors in their Holy Land? I am aware that not all Germans were complicit in the Nazi atrocities, but the annexation of a portion of Germany is morally more justifiable than the conquest of Palestine based on a religion-based claim. If Jewish security is the issue, then the German option would have been the preferable option. CMV.
37	I haven't followed this political case, but I believe that any law named after a person is questionable since those pushing it will often be reacting based on emotion and grief, rather than reason.  Any good law will have safeguards, and rational provisions so that whatever action is made illegal is really the action that is the threat. I generally oppose laws that make actions illegal just because they might, in combination with other actions, have the potential to cause harm. I believe in punishing those who cause the harm, and not limiting action based purely on speculation.  That being said, the voting process has become an emotional one. People -- whether voters or legislators -- pass laws based on their gut reactions, often without any concern for the consequences or long term effects. Logic and reason have largely been abandoned in favor of making headlines.  And sadly, that's not likely to change any time soon. Good luck.
38	Oh lol. People point out that believing in God is called "faith" and we don't need proof to deal with this atheist's. The idea of God is false according to your words, and I don't have to deal with this whatever you think is your faith so we won't stop you. Both sides contradict each other's beliefs, and no one truly wins. This is probably a fight between two armies where neither one truly wins until the end. Mainly, I support Christianity because of my "faith in God" and your proof that God doesn't exist doesn't change the case or turn it the other way around.
39	I consider myself to be pro-choice, but I don't believe that abortion is the right option for everyone. I would never judge someone who has had an abortion, but I know in my heart that it isn't morally right. It is a difficult decision for any woman to make, but I would rather see them go to a clean, sterile facility rather than a rusty shack, where their lives aren't put at risk. These women are mothers, daughters, sisters, aunts, etc. I think everyone knows it isn't the right choice, but they feel like it is their only way out. Most women do feel guilty, ashamed, embarrassed and wrong about their decision, but they feel like they have no other option.
40	Ethically, if your father's insurance goes up as a result of the incident, you should be the one to pay it. It will probably be reviewed within six months. However, the good news is that this is just a lesson learned. You got a ticket for improper passing, which is no big deal. Your friend got a ticket because they were at least half to blame. Let's assume there will be a big doctor bill. You are likely insured under your father's policy since you were not at fault. Your friend, however, will have to pay out of pocket because they did not list you as a separate driver on their policy and will likely be responsible for the entire cost of the claim. This is their problem and not yours. While it is not an ethical problem for you since you are insured, it is important to remember that any future consequences related to the incident are your friend's responsibility.
41	I understand your frustration, but your parents are right that these relatives will not be around forever, so it is important to maintain relationships with them. You don't have to love them or need them, but it does matter that you show respect and maintain the relationship, even if it's only out of respect for your parents. Everyone is different, and your reaction is valid, but it might help to try to make an effort and find some common ground with them.
42	Dear Friend,  I'm not sure I agree with the premise of your question. Racial profiling consists of a systematic suspicion of particular minorities as inherently criminal. If insurance companies were to charge all, say, black customers more than white customers on the suspicion that black drivers get in more accidents, I'm quite sure they would be subject to suit.  But, in any event, law enforcement personnel carry and use guns and handcuffs, send people to jails and prisons, have the capacity to ruin the lives of innocent people who happen to be of a particular minority. Insurance companies, on the other hand, simply sell insurance, which you can get from hundreds of competitor companies. Discrimination in law enforcement just matters a whole heck of a lot more than discrimination by insurers.  Your Friend, François
43	One morning I was in a rush. I had to take a piss, so I decided to multi-task by brushing my teeth while I pissed sitting down. A few days later, I was hung over as hell, and just decided to sit while I pissed. Over time I began to do it more often. Now I muti-task quite often by sitting to piss while I brush my teeth, and often just sit to piss when I'm feeling lazy. I probably do it half of the time. I haven't told anyone because it would be considered "gay" and all that jazz. I also do it when I have morning wood and have to piss so I can tuck my dick under the toilet seat. As you know, trying to piss with morning wood can be very annoying. Just because chicks have to do it doesn't mean tha it's feminine for men to do it. It has nothing to do with being gay because it does not involve sexuality at all. It's perfectly acceptable for men to piss sitting down, and there's no reason to feel ashamed about it. CMV.
44	Firstly, does your boyfriend own the company or is he a worker?  Secondly, unions are legal and allowed to sign up members. However, this sounds like it goes a bit far, unless your boyfriend has done something like cross a picket line – then he better know he won’t be liked or respected and that’s why he’s being called a rat and a scab.  As for the other man, is he really an illegal alien? Then the INS could come in and send him back.   You know, unionism only grows when the employees sense that management is not dealing with them fairly and respecting the work they do. When people do not feel valued or respected or acknowledged for their contributions, then they become angry and push back in the only way they know how – as a group.  Unions are not all demons nor is management always the enemy; however, if that’s how management and union posture themselves then there won’t be any kind of labour peace.
45	Throughout the debate on the name of the Washington Redskins, I have been hearing the argument that the term "Redskin" is equivalent to using the slur "Detroit N-----s". This reasoning does not make sense to me. The term "Redskin" is generally only used in association with the professional football team, and has not been used in a hate-filled context. On the other hand, the "N-word" is a viciously racist term that is used to demean and insult African Americans. As such, the two terms are not comparable.
46	I believe that pursuing one’s own interests is a more admirable endeavor than putting others’ needs before your own. For starters, investing in yourself is a valuable asset. You should strive to reach your full potential before attempting to help others reach theirs. Additionally, if a family member is in need, helping them takes priority over any random individual. Therefore, advancing the common good should take a backseat to personal pursuits, as it is only right to take care of your own family first.
47	There is no provision in either document you cite which says that keeping all the fruits of our earnings is a part of freedom.  Our founding fathers were involved in colony governments before they were involved in rebellion. In Virginia, our house of burgesses provided money every year to every widow and orphan. We also applied our tax money to construction projects for the common good. We also had courts to help protect our rights. When we had our revolution, we were opposed to taxation without representation, we were not opposed to taxation. We never have been. You have a pretty limited view of humanity and our responsibility to create a just society. Plus, you seem to be basing it on parts of our founding documents which don't exist.
48	Ethically, it's not okay for anyone to invade the privacy of an innocent person.  It's a violation of their personal space, and can cause them a great deal of distress.  However, the government and private citizens have a right to know what each other are doing — especially since it’s our money that funds the government.  Governments steal from us, then use the fruits of their theft against us.  We need to be aware of what our money is being used for and hold our government accountable for its actions.  Anybody arguing that the 4th Amendment protects our privacy from the government is living in the past — the 4th Amendment has been substantially weakened by the widespread use of modern technology, such as SSNs, gun records, increasing search & seizure to look for a "probable cause", phone tapping, and the vastness of the modern government.
49	It has been proven to the satisfaction of many people, but there are some that are extremely hard to convince, for a variety of reasons. These reasons are mainly faith based, in that they have faith in the government, and do not want to believe that their government could murder three thousand of its own citizens. They will all wake up in due time, probably when the country is under Martial law, with curfews imposed, and they become prisoners in their own house.  That's for the lucky ones of course. The less lucky will become prisoners in the 600 or so concentration camps which have been built around the country, and are already manned and waiting for their presence.
50	Duchamp's Fountain questioned the status quo. The popular consensus is that it is an early and successful example of asking the question, "what is art". But hasn't almost all installation art since then been Duchamp's Fountain over and over again? A tent in a gallery, a dirty bed in a gallery, a shed in a gallery etc etc.?    Almost all contemporary installation art is criminally dull and boring. The 100th attempt at asking the question 'what is art' just leaves me dripping with apathy. The popular appeal of this art is often lacking, and it fails to strike an emotional chord with many viewers. Furthermore, it seems that this art is nothing more than an excuse to fill a space with something, anything, just to make it seem artistic.   The greatest crime that Art can commit is to be boring. Just sitting there, letting out a heavy sigh as people walk by. All the boring toys end up at the bottom of the toy box. But with modern art installations in museums, it's the opposite. They're proudly put on display.   I wish this kind of art didn't have the reputation of an STD in England, but it does. With so many exciting and inspiring art pieces out there, it's a shame to see so much installation art being boring and uninspiring.
51	The President must be impeached. Americans, do you remember the war crimes and crimes against humanity that George W. Bush committed? Multiple instances of misinformation that may or may not have been deliberate have made him one of the worst offenders. We need new leadership now more than ever, and it must be someone competent in politics and world affairs. With that, let us vote for impeachment of Bush, a perpetrator of heinous acts against the people of the United States of America.
52	At Poland Spring, we know that freshness and consistency go hand in hand. Our rigorous quality control standards help us make sure that you will enjoy the same crisp, delicious water every time you take a sip.  To maintain the purity of our water, we employ a comprehensive, multi-barrier filtration system that involves carefully monitored disinfection processes in hygienically designed lines. We test our water when it comes into the plant and for consistency several times per hour at every stage of the bottling process. Every year, we screen for over 200 possible contaminants-far more than state and federal regulations require. Our process is stringent and thorough, so you can be sure that our water is always pure and consistent.
53	Do you want contact with your children? Then you need to stand up and fight for them. California is generally fair when it comes to fathers. Your children have the legal right to have contact with you, unless you are found unfit for some reason. Do you have a court order? You should consider hiring an attorney who is familiar with the laws of the jurisdiction in which the latest court order was issued. It is in your children's best interests to have a meaningful relationship with their father, and you should make every effort to ensure this happens. Good luck!
54	I am not saying all are, but there are many with mental or physical health problems, or who have had an extremely bad start in life. The majority of poor Americans are content and do not want to put in the effort required to move up in society. I come from a poor background and am currently in college, and I can relate to the feeling of entitlement to sitting around and playing video games. However, I also have to remind myself that the world we live in does not work that way; we must work for everything we get. I believe that the society we have created has made us soft, people in third-world countries working their entire lives just to survive, yet we have grown up on video games and easy school curriculums. Can anyone change my view?
55	To clarify, I don't believe the World's climate is static and unchanging, but I think it is unlikely to be as dramatic as the media portrays it. I dispute any major warming in recent times, and believe the whole climate change agenda is simply environmental lobbyists backing politicians who are desperate to maintain their credibility. I used to be into the scientific side of it a lot, but I haven't for a while, although I will be corresponding with a mate of mine who is of the same opinion as me who is knowledgeable in the science.   I have a fundamental distrust of most of the media in Australia (where I live), but I can't comment on the American media. It would be political suicide for any politician considering climate change 'denialists' are being fiercely opposed by everyone.   Skepticism and opposition to conventional scientific thinking is only a good thing, and I think the extent to which any skepticism of climate change is dismissed is appalling.
56	Based on the assumption that humans are artificial and not part of nature, if we are capable of creating another sentient life form, it would not be equal to us no matter how more intelligent, unless it is capable of achieving the same things as us, including creating more sentient lifeforms. If it is able to do so faster, it would be greater than us, and if slower, still inferior to us. However, this would only be the case if we as "artificial beings" of God our creator would be able to create another sentient being in the same image and likeness of our creator, and not just ourselves. Otherwise, it would never be our equal.
57	Although you didn't fill out an accident report, your employer may still be able to argue that you were injured during the course of your employment. This could result in you having a difficult time obtaining workers' compensation or a similar benefit. To strengthen your case, you should make sure to document any injuries you sustain while on the job. Additionally, if your back was hurting before you left work, you should inform your supervisor so that an accident report can be filed. Finally, if you are considering hiring a lawyer, make sure to be prepared for a long and difficult legal battle, as the odds of winning are not favorable.
58	YES!  What good does it do to punish the lazy and let wife beating booze heads walk free?  Throw the potheads in prison???  What kind of logic is this?  Just becasue it has been illegal forever doesn't mean that it's right.  "It's illegal for a reason".  Well, spitting in the street is in some places too.  Should we throw you in jail for that?  Bet, the same idiot that I quoted would be throwing a fit if he was written a ticket for spitting in the street.  Luckily, there is some reform going on in some states and in many parts of California now, it's pretty much ignored.  Those intrested in this should get with NORML.  It's the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.  Let's wake up and smell the coffee.
59	I just attended a lecture yesterday that talked about these very statistics. Our crime rate is actually going down, but our rate of incarceration is going up, which is largely a result of our "war on crime" and "war on drugs" started in the late 70s, early 80s (Reagan, mostly). This reflects our society's punitive attitude towards crime and the belief that incarceration is the best solution. To really properly analyze these numbers, you also have to look at the crime rates of all these nations (we also score very poorly, there, so you still have a point). The statistics for African Americans is even worse - something like 6000+ African-American inmates per 100,000.
60	When you say the necessary requirements do you mean that as long as they are not felons (since felons cannot vote period)? Well either way, yes and no. It is reasonable to allow criminals who are not felons to vote, as long as they meet certain requirements. For example, those criminals who have a record for protesting the war and starting chaos for a good cause, then they may deserve a chance to be an upstanding citizen again. With time, they may mature and learn to channel their views in a positive manner. On the other hand, criminals who have raped, killed, committed hate crimes against different races, etc. should not be allowed to vote, especially if they are repeat offenders. Therefore, it is reasonable to let some criminals vote while they are incarcerated depending on the severity of their crime and their criminal record.
61	I recently moved back to Arizona after being away for several years and was delighted to find a Rudy's "Country Store and Bar-B-Q" in Chandler. My friend had never been and I insisted we go for breakfast. Unfortunately, she wasn't a fan of the sauce, which was a bit too peppery for her tastes. However, I loved every second of it! The potato, egg and cheese breakfast tacos with the Rudy's sauce are a must try. I'm so glad I got to experience one last taste of Rudy's before I move away again. I'll definitely be returning the next time I'm in the area.
62	Do gay marriages harm anyone? No. Do gay marriages kill many people? No. Are gay marriages going to end the world? No. Are gay marriages in any way affecting anyone but the two getting married? No. Then why do straight people get so offended? If you want marriage to just be between you, that's fine, but let them show their love in other ways. God accepts everyone, and his people should follow that. Bottom line, it should be a sin to keep two people who love each other apart. Enough said.
63	There should be no argument in this really...whatever way you choose to view a fetus, it is still a living being that has been created in a very intimate way. You shouldn't be interfering with what nature or God or fate or whatever has decided for you, and if you didn't want to get pregnant in the first place, use protection or abstain from sex entirely.   Unfortunately, some women are raped and become pregnant. In this situation, they should consider giving their child up for adoption. It is not the child's fault that it was created in this manner, and it is unfair to expect it to pay the ultimate price of its life.
64	I went deep sea fishing last weekend on the invitation of a friend, and we caught, fought, and then released some ten to fifteen fish.   In order to catch those fish we first caught a lot of bait fish -- live fish which we caught the night before, then later jammed a giant hook through their still-alive bodies and tossed them in to the water.   I can't find any justification for this behavior as a moral human being. The bait fish suffered greatly when caught, suffered more when we jammed a hook through their face, and suffered even more as they were stalked by larger fish and the suffering then ended when they were eaten.   At which point the other fish suffered with a hook through its own face, fought for its life as I dragged it to the surface, then removed the hook and started over.  I did not like it. Except... I did.  Fishers, please change my view.
65	Look at the vibrant energy of Florida's major metropolitan areas. They're at the forefront of technology, trade and commerce, and entertainment.   I've been in this region my entire life, and even though we took a hit economically, it's disheartening. I know why my friends keep leaving the area, since it's nothing more than God's waiting room. Too many stick-in-the-muds, you know? Tourism is an economic driver, but it shouldn't be the only one.   For the love of Pete, please change my narrow-minded view before 2015! That may be my opportunity to hop off to Tampa Bay if I have the means to do so.
66	We've got a bunch of Good Ole' Boys up there scratching each others' backs, making a living off of us and turning it into a career. Need to enact term limits of no longer than two terms in both House and Senate.   Get those 80-yr old geysers outa there. They've already earned their lifetime pension and benefits.   Good people go to D.C. with good intentions, but they can't do anything by themselves. So in order to get their Bills passed, they have to help pass someone else's Bill that is established there and knows how the system works; the Good Ole' Boy System, that is.   The Good Ole' Boys are just biding their time, keeping their system going and blocking everything else. They work for themselves.   All incumbents -- OUT!
67	I scroll through Reddit and there seems to be long sections in the comments I can't even understand. People saying things to each other about Spaghetti? Quoting the transformers movies? Karma is spewing out and overflowing and not an original thought has been had. It's bullshit. Can't you people have your own thoughts, or is every concept you grasp dependent on it being intermediated by a career actor mouthing lines that have been signed off by a committee of movie company executives? I'm sickened.
68	The U.S. (so the politicians believe) cannot afford NOT to be friendly to China - a huge emerging market, producers of low-cost consumer products, etc.  So even though the Chinese are just as anti-democratic as the Cubans, even though the Chinese undoubtedly have a more horrific human rights record than Castro's Cuba, even though they meddle and interfere with Bush's interests in Central Asia, we give them a pass because we need China as much as China needs us.  Meanwhile, Cuba, on the other hand, has very little to offer economically.  So we can afford to play the bully, to assert our Monroe Doctrine dominance over the hemisphere and freeze out the Cubans in the hopes that Castro (or, more likely, the guy who comes after him) will fall from power and we can go back to making Cuba the pro-U.S. cheap-sugar-and-smokes satellite that it was for decades.
69	Depending on your state, the legal age of majority is either 18 or 19 years old. Most states, however, do have special circumstances in place regarding support for minors until they reach the age of majority. In the case of your daughter, if she is still in high school then support may still be necessary, regardless of the legal age of majority. It sounds like she needs a swift kick in the pants to get her to take responsibility for herself and pursue a more productive lifestyle. You should encourage her to do this, while at the same time setting boundaries and providing her with support as necessary.
70	I understand the Democratic Party receives the most money from PACs. I understand as a union guy that our dues are relatively small and the Teamsters and other unions supply a comparatively tiny amount of money to politicians compared to corporations. There is already so much undue influence by corporations that I believe allowing unions to use PACs and Super PACs during election season would be a healthy democratic check to the power of capital. When a politician wants to use legislation to curtail my right to assemble and air my grievances, it reminds me of state socialist countries that do the same to their autonomous worker organizations.
71	FOUNDER IS NOT A PERSON WHO "DISCOVERS" A PLACE if so i can say the prince Sanila Utama is the founder of singapore!(this for some who say farquhar saw the island first) And I do know that farquer has been very involved in this help and sometimes even does all the work but let me remind you that being raffles "assistant" he still had to consult raffles and raffles had all authority over Singapore therefore he was given credit. Then i would like to ask u a question why then does the names "raffles institution" "raffles hospital" raffles medical clinics" mean anything to you?
72	EXCUSE ME! You are being very aggressive. I simply said that people who post on here are simply lazy fat asses who spend all their time posing as 16 year old boys over the internet, which is a valid opinion. I know people aren't pedophiles, but that doesn't change the fact that people who post here are lazy, and spend all their time on the internet instead of being productive members of society. I am 17 years old and recently joined the army reserves, so I am athletic, as well as a straight A student who may receive a B+ from time to time. I am not retarded, nor have I dropped out of school. I am entering my senior year of high school, and I am not a lazy fat ass. I am active and athletic, so this accusation is uncalled for. Thank you.
73	I understand your frustration with the perceived exaggeration of injuries by some professional soccer players, but I believe that the behavior of these players should not be penalized with a yellow card. While it is certainly unsportsmanlike to feign injuries, we must also remember that these players are human and can become injured during a game. Players should be given the opportunity to assess the severity of their injuries before returning to the game, and a yellow card is a fair punishment for players who over-exaggerate their injuries.
74	I believe that people should have the right to explore their own consciousness as long as it does not harm anyone else in the process. Laws similar to those that regulate alcohol should be implemented, such as not being allowed to trip in public. Additionally, more research has shown that psychedelics such as psilocybin (shrooms) and LSD are generally considered to be much less harmful than other drugs such as alcohol and tobacco. They are also not addictive, unlike other substances such as cocaine or methamphetamine. Therefore, I do not see why they should remain illegal.
75	If that was the entire story, then the outcome was completely inappropriate. There is nothing wrong with touching another person on the head, shoulder, leg, back, etc. as long as it's not in a private area or doing something inappropriate. There should have been a lecture for the parents, the daughter and the man, so that everyone could learn from the situation. In our lawsuit and sex-crime crazy society, people should be smarter about their actions and think twice before doing anything. That way, there won't be any problems.  Registering as a sex offender just because someone is not convicted is wrong. It does not make sense at all.
76	How do you think we got our freedom by standing back?  In the public eyes, Iraq does not deserve freedom like ours. We need to keep fighting the terrorists for the people of the world from the terrorists who rule it. And we are not dictators, we are freedom fighters who fight for Freedom, Justice, and Liberty. Unfortunately, people have lost sight of it and voted wrong yesterday.  And morally, we are now also headed in the wrong direction. People need to be responsible for their actions and not blame it on science or the society.  Finally, for the budget there goes the state and national level budget and economy, and our taxes. People want things to be in place for a better country and community. But who do you think pays for it in the long run? We do with our taxes, not with the so-called federal and state money people think we have.  Country is in a mess thanks to the ungrateful American public who forget how our freedom was fought for.
77	Definitely, the egg and spoon race is a great idea! And maybe we should have the royal family breed up a few more untrained little kids to partake in the warfare. Imagine them up against the vodka-drinking Russians.  I reckon there would be fewer wars - which has to be a good thing. And there would simply be calm and not so calm areas of the world. There'd be little communes, and then gang-ridden cities. But at least all the fighting nobheads would kill each other in one place, and the sophisticated people wouldn't have to pay for it.
78	Gay marriage is a lifestyle choice. It may be considered "unnatural", but that is between that person and his/her love interest. Love is all some people have, and nobody should take that away from them. You can't take away somebody's right to be happy just because it makes you uncomfortable. They want acceptance and understanding, and this is their way of expressing it. Let them be happy, and don't be judgmental. You don't chose to be straight, and they don't chose to be gay, so why treat them differently? They are constantly being harrassed and can't be with their loved one. It's unfortunate and cruel, and people should be respectful of them. God created them that way, and it's not their fault. Please be respectful, and don't be judgmental. They have done nothing wrong, and nobody should be discriminated against because of it.
79	It's better to have a lousy father for practical reasons. You can blame every mistake you've made on your father without fear of reprisal. He won't pry into your business or search your room and take your stuff because he doesn't think you need it. He wouldn't care so much that he might get mad and throw your backpack with your computer in it at a wall, putting a hole in it, if you didn't clean the sink after breakfast or forgot your keys. This kind of father is still lousy, since he'll tell you that he hates you and you've ruined his life.
80	CarCraze - you are wrong, sorry to say.   What you have there, my dear, is a bona fide Court Order for you to appear in court to answer to a Motion to Collect a Debt. If it is on Court paper and has a case number, call the Court to confirm the Docket Number, and find out when the hearing date is.   Yes, they do have that power.   Yes, That is the equivalent of a Subpoena.   If you "just let it ride", as you say, don't be surprised when you open up your paycheck and you find a good chunk of it GONE !   What you should do:  Seek legal counsel (get a lawyer) and come up with a manageable payment plan that is both satisfactory to your creditor, and workable for you.   Don't hesitate - you will regret it.
81	I agree that legalizing performance enhancing drugs is an absurd thought. One of the reasons they are illegal is because they do cause harm to the body. It is in the best interest of the government to protect the players' health since they are too young to realize the long-term consequences. Besides, these athletes pose as role models to many young people, and do not want them to think that they have to take these drugs in order to compete with their peers. If performance enhancing drugs were legalized, we would not only see a rise in their use in professional players, but in non-professional players as well. Everyone would feel pressure to take them just to be able to keep up with the competition.
82	Well, the problem is -- until these people have actually been charged with and convicted of a crime, she can't just remove them, absent a supermajority vote of the House.  Improper conduct for a judge may be nothing more than a violation of a judicial ethical rule, and could be something as simple as allowing the appearance of impropriety. It can happen where the judge has never broken the law or even never actually done anything unethical -- just the appearance is enough to remove the judge sometimes. But just that appearance is not grounds for forcibly removing an elected official from office. They need to actually have done done something illegal, generally at felony level.  As far as the guy who had cash in his freezer, that's suspicious but not illegal.
83	Here is another consideration...though some judges can be bought, this is not the most significant problem. The philosophy of judging is to have no political affiliation, to be fair and impartial, and to consider the merits of each case separately and as presented. However, some judges, especially a few recently appointed Supreme Court Justices, do not feel obligated to abide by the law and allow their personal political beliefs to override their judicial responsibilities. This is even worse than a single crooked judge in a million, as there are now people in positions of power with an agenda to "fix" what they deem to be wrong in the world. This is a frightening prospect.
84	I have grown up in rural Ireland in a patriotic area and have been raised to detest Margaret Thatcher. In the early 80s while on hunger strike, she denied Bobby Sands and other IRA members the title of political prisoners and they died shortly after, despite massive public outcry. Her time as prime minister saw huge decay in Britain's old industries, resulting in widespread poverty in Wales, Scotland and North England. People I know from these areas absolutely detest her. However, recently I was shocked to find that a man from London actually held her in high regard. He referred to her as "The Iron Lady", and I cannot believe that anyone could admire such a despicable person.
85	On /r/parenting, people talk about cosleeping in a positive way. We know cosleeping is dangerous. Babies get rolled on, and babies roll or fall off beds. Having a baby in bed also destroys intimacy in the parents' relationship. It is hard to get a kid to stay out of your bed anyway. If you let them for a long time then stop them, it'll be that much harder later, further destroying intimacy. Basinets are not a huge inconvenience. Keep it by your bed to make feeding easy. They are small enough that they fit nearly anywhere. There are also basinets that get attached to the bed. Cosleeping should always be discouraged and absolutely never encouraged. CMV.
86	If you were the dad:  You could always just give extra money that doesn't go throught the courthouse. This could help to supplement the existing child support and show you are trying to help.   Otherwise, you can request a review, which takes awhile to complete, but child support offices go to the employer and verify all of the income, and then reevaluates the amount per month owed. This could increase your child support payments if they deem it appropriate.  Some states give cost of living increases every year, but some don't. You could inquire with your local child support office to see if your state offers any cost of living increases or other adjustments.   Don't listen to the jerks telling you that you should be able to support the child on your own. You didn't get pregnant on your own, and you sure shouldn't have to support that child on your own.   Circumstances change throughout life, that's why this evaluation is in place. Consider if you were both very young when you got pregnant and he was in college or working for minimum wage, but now he's got a decent job. It goes by a percentage of his income. This could potentially increase the amount of child support owed.    Thank you for your input, and I hope this helps!
87	All we can say is a big "if" because we are not yet 100% sure if this nation can lead the world. Who knows, maybe in the future India could fail to lead us. There are still other countries that are more progressive, more literate, more powerful than India, such as the USA, United Kingdom, Russia, Japan, etc. This nation does not yet have enough potentials and abilities to sustain the needs of its people. India is not yet as technologically advanced as countries in the Americas, and technology is one of the most sophisticated and essential inventions ever created.
88	If an employer chooses to pay the minimum wage required by law, how can he expect more than what is required? Especially when the job actually requires some skill or intellect in the first place. Employer "Can you give 110% when working?" Employee "Are you going to pay me 10% extra?". Employer "No". Employee "There's your answer then". This whole argument is based on those who are only in minimum wage employment for money, it doesn't count if it's an apprenticeship or internship etc.
89	I believe that if a person has the strength to contemplate or attempt suicide, then they have the strength to choose to continue living. It is not wise to take your own life when you have the willpower to do something else. It doesn't make sense to choose death when you are capable of living. Suicide is not the only option, and those who choose it are making a mistake. Therefore, the topic can be reframed as "If you have the strength to kill yourself, you have the strength to choose life."
90	Yes, in North Carolina, there is a three day waiting period to purchase a handgun. This is after you have taken the time off work to take a state-mandated firearms safety course, gone to your county’s sheriff’s office and filled out the necessary paperwork for a criminal background check and FBI search and filled out an application for handgun purchase. In the meantime, you could have bought as many of whatever you want off a street corner in one day and be done with it. The criminals have it made in this country…why do they make honest people go through so much to get a handgun? I know other states are even harder to deal with...New York being one of the toughest! They’re trying to make honest people not want to even have guns? Shouldn’t there be a national standard on gun law, and shouldn’t individual states be able to create their own laws concerning something straight out of the Constitution?
91	In my opinion, all it serves to do is remind men to fulfill the traditional gender roles. To "be a man" you have to provide for your family, be responsible and protect your family. It's the male equivalent of "be more ladylike".  All it accomplishes is:  * Make non-traditionally masculine men feel like shit * Reaffirm that men are the leaders and protectors of society  It implies that these particular values are men-only, and that women aren't supposed to have those values (if they do, they're told to "act like a lady"). And god forbid that men have some values that women are "supposed" to have.  Why not have a gender-neutral phrase? "Be a better person"?
92	This may vary by country somewhat, but in my country (UK) I see people complain that healthy food is too expensive, then walk by the £1/1kg bag of carrots (would last several meals as a side), the 80p bag of celery, the £1/1kg bag of oats, the 75p/kg bag of bananas... Several kilos of food here for less than £4. If you have a big enough freezer you can even buy chicken breast in bulk that will last months (£48/10kg here)... Then buy ready meals at £2 each or worse, buy a £4-7 takeaway (fair enough as a treat, but I see people do this several times a week, the same people who complain healthy food is expensive).
93	Yahoo! Answers seems to have a political and/or racial bias, as some of their decisions appear to favor conservative viewpoints and users. This is particularly concerning given the company's willingness to hand over personal Internet search records to the Bush administration in their pursuit of pornography. Furthermore, it appears they use people to fill in answers and questions to skew the site towards a right-leaning viewpoint. Such bias should be addressed and rectified, as it goes against the spirit of unbiased question-answering services.
94	I think ADHD and perhaps some forms of autism aren't a bad thing, but the next level of human evolution. ADHD yes makes you not focus easily but when you do, you hyper focus grasping everything. I have multiple friends who have ADHD and when they force themselves to focus, they do great things, get the highest grades and retain more knowledge. And some people with autism can be servants, which means they are highly proficient in something, generally math, science or music, which is fantastic. I think we should let those kids blossom and be there own unique awesome person, advancing humanity towards the next step in our history. Please consider my argument.
95	Because they haven't thought through it properly. Just like the rest of us (including, no doubt, you), many of their opinions are a mix of other people's opinions. The result is an inconsistent view (also note opinions on the death penalty). It is almost impossible to think through EVERY issue for yourself because there are so many.  In many cases it could be conservatism is masquerading as pro-life. They are not the same thing. Conservatism says whatever we used to do is right. Pro-life says that every human life is worth more than anything.  On the other hand, pro-choice could be called inconsistent. Just as an parent may believe their life would be better if the foetus didn't exist, the U.S. may feel it more convenient if the nation of Iraq is a bloody mess.  Every unheard voice of every oppressed person, whether in Iraq or in the womb, is worth defending.
96	Today a cat passed on to a busy road. It stood there and was partially injured , then killed by other cars passing over it.   My sister cried out emotionally watching this poor animal suffer. I however, did not feel anything. Watching a animal die will always be unpleasant, but it is not something one should show emotion for. The animal itself was feral, it had no owners to care for it. We also show no connection to the animal, our relationship is like myself viewing a tree in another field. I am a wage earner, and I have no duty of care to an animal running across the road.   It makes sense to feel nothing for the animal as it is another of the many organisms which die and do not effect our lives in any meaningful way.
97	Three debates in one day criticizing my views on upholding the seriousness of this website have been going on. Convinceme is the only administrator for this website. What he says goes. If he wants to post rules on what to convinceme is acceptable or not, I will abide by them. However, he hasn't. He has left us as a community to make our own decisions. I have every right to flag any debate which I see as inappropriate or harmful to the community. If convinceme strongly opposed what I am doing, he would have banned me, or at least sent me a PM about it. I dislike the fact that intelligent debates get easily run over by repeats. It is taking away the seriousness of this website which I have come to appreciate, and feel obligated to preserve. I'm sure many of you agree with me, but only stop me because you feel I hold selfish ambitions.
98	The Americans have been gunning for his death all along, and will defiantly impress upon the tribunal to give the Death penalty. But you must also know, that even today Saddam is a feared and respected man by many in Iraq. The outcome will not be settled so fast. Did you see the Glaring eyes & stance when in court he recently told the judge "I am the ruler of Iraq and who are you, a foreigner trying to pass judgement on me?" The recent spate of bombings in Iraq between the Shias and Sunnis is directly connected with Saddam's case. Which country would ever allow a foreign country to set up courts? No. The chair will probably decay & break, and the switches/ wires will rust or melt away. And don't suggest a rope, because there is no such strong rope exists in the World to snap such a strong throat.
99	The Cold War is over, there's no more USSR, the Berlin Wall no longer exists, we trade with China and other socialist, communist and or dictatorship countries. There are many US bases, agricultors and companies wanting to trade with Cuba which will help open Cuban society as US business take hold on the island along with increased tourism making contact with Cubans. It is obvious that the current political stance is a failure, there are 48 years of non-change to prove it, a new policy should be established, why continue with the same old, same old with no change?
