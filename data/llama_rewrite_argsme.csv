0	Climate change clearly does not exist, as there is no evidence to suggest that it is man-made or even a significant issue.  Firstly, exhaling carbon dioxide is not a clear threat to our climate - we all do it, as do our cars. Secondly, it is a conspiracy, and thirdly there are no sources to back up the claims made. Here are my sources which tell you how "Climate Change" doesn't exist:   Top 10 reasons why climate change does not exist - http://www.globalclimatescam.com...   Facts about this "global warming" hoax - http://www.newsmax.com...   The conspiracy behind "Climate Change" - https://en.wikipedia.org...
1	A scientific consensus exists on the reality of anthropogenic climate change. This conclusion is supported by numerous studies, including those cited above, which demonstrate that humans are causing global warming. Man-made climate change has already claimed human lives and continues to do so. In a general context where the anthropogenic contribution to climate change is becoming more plausible, this has resulted in an excess of 14,947 deaths in France, between August 4 and 18, 2003. The greatest increase in mortality was due to causes directly attributable to heat: dehydration, hyperthermia, heat stroke. The association between climate change and the frequency and intensity of extreme heat events is now well established. The World Health Organisation estimates that the warming and precipitation trends due to anthropogenic climate change of the past 30 years already claim over 150,000 lives annually. Many prevalent human diseases are linked to climate fluctuations, from cardiovascular mortality and respiratory illnesses due to heatwaves, to altered transmission of infectious diseases and malnutrition from crop failures. The consensus that humans are causing recent global warming is shared by 90-100% of publishing climate scientists according to six independent studies by co-authors of this paper. Those results are consistent with the 97% consensus reported by Cook et al.
2	My position on climate change is that it is undeniably occurring and primarily caused by human activity. Recent research shows that 97% of scientists agree that global warming is real and those who reject this consensus are being unscientific. The arguments of climate change deniers are based on personal opinion and not backed up by evidence. I wish my opponent the best of luck. Sources: Shaftel, H. (Ed.). (2012, January 5). Global Climate Change: Consensus. Retrieved February 3, 2015, from http://climate.nasa.gov...
3	There is an overwhelming scientific consensus that climate change presents a serious risk to the future of the Earth and to mankind. Many of the threats we face due to climate change are insidious and will not be noticed by those in denial. But they are real and serious. Among these are the spread of potentially lethal diseases such as that caused by the Zika virus. Other diseases formerly confined to the tropics will spread across North America and Europe.  Furthermore, the production of child pornography should be restricted due to the immense harm done to children in the production of it. The magnitude of this harm is such that it violates the First Amendment. Therefore, free speech can be restricted in this circumstance.  The ignorance spread by climate change deniers should be stopped, as many of them do so for greed. These will include teenagers who will be sent to fight the increasing number of wars and conflicts which will likely occur due to climate change. Yes, the risk is too high to allow this ignorance to continue to be spread.  Should we jail people who write and utter falsehoods about climate change? If need be, yes.  The argument has been rewritten in a way that better expresses the desired opinion while still preserving the original structure of the argument.
4	I'll accept this challenge. First, I should ask to be clear: When you say "climate change is a fraud, " are you referring specifically to anthropogenic climate change or all climate change? If it is the former, As I suspect it is, I won't waste time explaining all the evidence that the globe is, In fact, Warming at an unprecedented rate and instead go straight into attribution. If, However, You don't think the globe is really warming at an unprecedented rate, I'm happy to go into the evidence for it. Moreover, "fraud" implies more than just the majority of scientists being wrong (i. E. Misinterpreting the evidence) but also that they are intentionally lying. This is a big claim given the number of scientists who support the concept of anthropogenic climate change and one that incurs its own burden of proof. See you some time in the next 72 hours.
5	The climate is changing, and the impacts of climate change are already being felt. The local weather may not be changing, but global climate patterns are shifting, leading to more extreme weather events, sea level rise, and other impacts. The oceans are indeed rising, as measured by satellites that track the Earth's shape. The IPCC is not a communist organization, but is instead an intergovernmental body made up of members from different countries. Many respected scientists and organizations agree that human-caused climate change is real and not a conspiracy. The science of climate change is not necessarily full of misconceptions or bad science, and the evidence for climate change is widespread and convincing. Video evidence refuting the claims of climate change denial is largely anecdotal and not scientific. The 97% consensus is indeed real and has been verified by multiple sources. There is also evidence that climate change denial is largely funded by the fossil fuel industry, and skeptical scientists and organizations may have a secret agenda to protect their economic interests. The math behind the 97% consensus is correct and it is impossible for a tiny minority to overturn the scientific consensus with anecdotal evidence. It is true that human activities can contribute to climate change, but the impact of humanity is not mathematically impossible or against the laws of physics. In addition, the more CO2 that is in the atmosphere, the more it can absorb before reaching its saturation point, meaning that increased CO2 levels can actually amplify global warming. Maurice Strong was indeed found to be corrupt, but this does not necessarily mean that the entire climate change movement is a fraud. Finally, climate data fraud, tree ring misuse, and other examples of denialism are largely refuted by independent organizations and websites.
6	Greetings and welcome to the debate. In this round, I will present my key reasons for believing that climate change is indeed real, And not a hoax, As certain political leaders have said. But first, We must define climate change. The official definition of climate change is: a change in global or regional climate patterns, In particular a change apparent from the mid to late 20th century onwards and attributed largely to the increased levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide produced by the use of fossil fuels.  My first reason is that we have seen a huge increase in COS22; levels in the atmosphere, And this can be correlated with human industrial activity. In fact, Atmospheric COS22; levels are directly proportionate to human industrial activity. And, Increasing COS22; levels lead to a predictable rise in temperature. You may say that climates change anyway, And COS22; levels will fluctuate naturally, But it is no coincidence that it starts changing rapidly the moment humans figure out how to mine coal and burn fossil fuels.  My second reason is that the Earth's temperature has risen by approximately 1"C since 1969. This might not seem like much, But in comparison to previous climate changes, It is vastly significant. Ocean temperatures have also risen by 0. 7"F, Killing a statistically significant proportion of the Great Barrier Reef.  My final reason is that Arctic sea ice is shrinking, And polar bears may see the first iceless summer by 2050. So, We can conclude that climate change is indeed real, And not a hoax. I await my opponent's argument!
7	I propose that climate change is a serious issue that must be addressed and that the people who support it are not frauds or charlatans. The science of human-caused climate change is strong and based on many factors, including video evidence, the In-depth Story Behind A Climate Fraud, the 97% consensus fraud, and much more. It is clear that climate change is real and must be addressed, not dismissed. There is proof that climate change is not all fake news started by Obama & crew. Those people who listen to that scientist are not a joke.  Video evidence - The In-depth Story Behind A Climate Fraud.  The 97% consensus fraud.  It's mathematically impossible and against the laws of physics that a tiny human mass verses huge Earth mass, That the former can effect the latter.  The properties of CO2 are such that it can't create global warming on the scale indicated by scientists. This is because CO2 reaches it's saturation point at 80 parts / million and doesn't reflect any significant amount of heat after this point is reached.  Maurice Strong is the main person that started this whole climate frenzy movement and was found to be corrupt and fled to China to hide from the global police.  Climate data fraud. Tree rings used as evidence when it is known that tree ring growth is not an accurate measurement of temperature. "Hide the decline" email by Phil Jones. Mike's trick. Hockey stick nonsense. Inverted graphs. Etc.  There, That should keep you busy for a while. Refute all these points. Good luck.
8	The task at hand is to “contend that anthropogenic climate change is non-existent.” From a common definition, anthropogenic means relating to, or resulting from the influence of human beings on nature. Then, from common usage, “climate change” means a harmful rise in global temperature. This could be a difficult task. The Earth's atmosphere is 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, 0.9% argon, and 0.1% trace gases including CO2. [1]  Assume (for this paragraph only) that the small trace gas of CO2 (0.04%) is the cause of global warming. The focus here will be upon sources of CO2 emissions both natural and manmade. The source emissions of CO2 would, by a most rational people, be the cause of global warming. According to the IPCC, 800 gigatons of CO2 is emitted into the atmosphere from nature and man, annually. [2]  Most rational people would consider a source that is more than 51% to be the cause of a problem. Some irrational people might try to argue that 33% would be a threshold for cause. Only, crazy people would state that something that is less than 5% could be consider the cause. That brings us to the percent of total CO2 emissions from mankind. That percent of CO2 emissions is 3.62% (29 from man of 800 total gigatons)! [2] This 3.62% can not be the cause of global warming.  Now, questioning if CO2 is the cause of global warming. The alarmist side uses thresholds in parts per million (PPM). 400 PPM sounds scary and 0.04% is at an insanely small amount, both numbers are the same. Imagine, how quick the alarmists arguments would be dismissed if they said that 0.04% of atmospheric gases drove global climate. Then, if combined with only 3.6% of annual CO2 emissions is from man, this is an incredibly small number that man is responsible for.  Using just common sense methods, it becomes very hard to believe claims made by alarmists.   Anyone attempting to say 3.6% is the cause of a problem would be laughed at. Especially, when the gas in question is exhaled by each one of us. The real reasons for climate change to be anthropogenic is political and financial. Just federal grants for climate change related projects is greater than $10 billion. [3]  Scientists are just as financially motivated as anyone else. A climate scientist that is outside of the mainstream will not be funded. This creates incentives to stay in agreement with those in political power. Anthropogenic climate change as a political is perfect for oppressive progressive politicians. The solutions to this false issue are more governmental control over the daily lives of harmless people. The politicians have scientist by the purse strings, this ensures compliance. This debate is about causes not effects, thus positive and negative impacts will not be addressed.

9	Round two arguments. First, the scientific consensus on climate change is settled, and this is a political debate that deniers try to make look like a scientific one. The 97% consensus among climate scientists is undeniable and unequivocal. Additionally, a consilience of evidence, social calibration, and social diversity exist which point towards the same conclusion. Moreover, 31,000 scientists did not sign a petition to dispute the consensus; instead, the petition itself is an attempt to downplay the significance of the agreement among climate scientists. Finally, while the atmospheric concentration of Co2 is the highest it has been in over 800,000 years, global temperatures are rising, glaciers are losing mass, and humans' fingerprints show humans are extremely likely to be causing these events. Burning of fossil fuels and the released Co2 is the main driver of climate change. Thank you.
10	Greetings! Thank you for this debate, this should be fun! In accepting this debate I do not pretend to stand for all of feminism seeing as there are many different sects of the movement. I also do not claim to know everything about feminism. I will use sources from the internet as well as books to support my argument. First, we must define Feminism. There are many different types of feminism. For example: Antiporn feminism, Cultural Feminism, Hip Hop feminism, Lesbian Feminism, Queer feminism, and Radical feminism. The feminism it seems you disagree with is the one that is prevalent in the Pink Hat movement. But my stance will be from the Antiporn and Cultural Feminist movements. These movements advocate for the recognition that women are more nurturing, cooperative, and communicative, instead of measuring themselves against men, women should make their own activities more visible and valued. To further this, we must do away with the dehumanization of women in pornography, which only further serves to objectify and diminish them. In conclusion, feminism has not gone too far, rather, it has not gone far enough.
11	Feminism has no gender. I am a man and I am a feminist. Feminism, by definition, stands up for all my perspectives, ambitions, desires and behaviors. Feminism is the act of advocating (though perhaps passively in some circumstances) against woman abuse, and everything which leads to women being slandered - including false propaganda of feminism by sluts who enable womanizers and glorify perverts such as homosexuality. { It is not an act of feminism to defend a slut who enabled an adulterous man. That would be counterproductive. } I am pro-feminism, that is why I accepted this debate. And feminism has no gender, nor negative attributes.
12	Con has argued that dictionaries do not authoritatively define words, but has given no proof of this. Con's only argument in this entire debate is that "since 'masculinism' is male supremacy, then feminism is female supremacy". Without providing any evidence to back the claim that words with similar roots cannot have different meanings, Con's argument is not sound. Furthermore, Con has not provided any source of definition for "Masculinism", so Con's argument is not valid.   I have offered six authoritative sources stating that Feminism is the movement for equality between men and women. I am for equality between men and women. I am for Feminism. Con's statement of debate is "Feminism". I have proven I am Pro. I have proven Con is not Con.
13	You claim that feminism encourages false rape accusations and stereotyping men as bad. This is incorrect; feminism is the doctrine advocating social, political, and all other rights of women equal to those of men[1]". Now, you admit that this is something you are for, so I guess you have problems with how feminists go about this? Really, I think your entire argument stems from a complete misunderstanding of the movement. So, what is feminism? This is a difficult question because, much like religion, feminism is different for each feminist. The mission statement of the movement is equal rights between the sexes, which you agree is good. By this definition, you are a feminist. If you could indicate how you aren't a feminist, that'd be appreciated. Maybe you disagree that there is a systematic discrimination against women, the patriarchy. Is there a patriarchy? Well, as it commonly seems to be the case, I must define "the patriarchy". Basically, it means a system where men are valued over women[2]. This can be shown in the wage gap[3], rape culture[4] (though men can be victims of rape, rape culture usually targets women), and gender roles[5].  Rebuttals: What you are saying here is very dangerous. Stating that feminism promotes false rape accusations is an example of rape culture. 60% of victims report abuse, and 97% of abusers will not see jail[6]. Only 1.5-8% of rape reports are fake[7], so Puh-LEASE do not try and say that considerable amount of rape reports are fake and that we should cast doubt on those few that come forward. If we are going of the definition of feminism I stated earlier, then feminists aren't trying to put men as stereotypically bad. We are trying to make men and women equal. If you think that trying to remove the bias towards men is trying to say they are bad, then I am going to have to ask you go to timeout because that idea is downright childish. In the end there you say something about "calling the police about something ridiculous is obscure". I think you mean absurd, but if you didn't then I'm not sure what that would mean. If it is obscure, then false rape accusations don't happen often and thus shouldn't be a problem. If you meant absurd, then I would agree that false rape accusations are deplorable, but again I would say that "false rape reports" is not a tenant of feminism nor is it a likely to occur.  In short, yes, I do think feminism encourages false rape accusations and stereotyping men as bad. Men are often victims of these sort of actions and it is wrong to victimize anyone. Also, I think rape culture exists and is a big part of why rape is so prevalent. Rape culture is bad and the fact that feminism would support it is worrisome. I also disagree that the patriarchy is only limited to men being valued over women. The patriarchy is a system of male domination that is enacted through various means, such as gender roles, to oppress women and keep them in a subordinate position. I know you said this yourself, but I'm just clarifying. Finally, I think that the statistics you provided about rape are very interesting and actually support my side of the argument. Again, in the end, my entire argument stems from a misunderstanding of feminism; I believe that it is a powerful movement which can and should be used for good, however, I also believe that there are portions of it which go too far and become detrimental to society. Additionally, I think that feminism should not overshadow other causes such as equal pay for equal work, and women being able to make decisions regarding their own bodies. To conclude, I will be sure to make sure to keep an open mind to different perspectives and do more research into this topic. Thank you for the debate.
14	As per the rules of the debate as set by my opponent, this will be my final argument. Since my opponent has failed to formulate a response, I see little need to elaborate much on my previous post. I will merely offer a brief summary of my arguments and this debate as a whole. My opponent claims that feminism is an incorrect argument. While I don't consider feminism an argument, I accepted the debate under these terms so I will argue as such. My opponent has offered nothing but an unsupported opinion regarding what he believes is feminism; a term of which he seems to lack a full understanding. There were no parameters set for this debate in terms of a place in which we were arguing, yet my opponent seems to have focused his argument purely on feminism in the United States. In fact, he basically concedes the debate by stating "in 1st world countries such as the USA, there should be no such thing as a feminist. The same can not be said for 3rd world countries, where women rights have not been established and women often have to be near a man to go anywhere in the city." Had we focused this debate on USA or first world countries alone, that statement would not be considered a concession, but the fact that we did not specify those terms shows that my opponent agrees that feminism is at least necessary in some places. Now let's ignore the fact that Con conceded the debate already and pretend we were just addressing first world countries. Con offers no sources to show that equality now fully exists, nor does he provide and decent explanation as to why feminism should disappear once success has been found. The fact of the matter is, inequality between the sexes still exists, as I showed in my previous round, and even once equality is reached here, feminism will still be important to help maintain that equality and to help spread the ideology throughout the countries where help is needed. Finally, if my arguments and sources are not enough to convince the reader, the fact that Con has only provided one poorly written paragraph backed by no sources, merely opinions, followed by a forfeited round, should be enough to win me this debate. I would like to thank the readers for taking the time to read this debate.
15	I agree with you that feminism is needed in countries where women are oppressed and have little rights, but you must consider the conditions of the countries' economy and social interactions as well as religious factors. Such a movement that says "Women now have the ability of free will under no circumstances can their husbands control what they do" could cause mass revolts that would massacre women and could spark a rebellion against these weak third world countries. Before feminism is introduced, slow, progressive changes should be made to deal with each conflict differently. You are very correct that feminism is no longer needed in first world countries like the US, but democracy and peace must reach these areas first. Much of these Middle Eastern countries make these laws due to their interpretation of Islamic values, which states that a woman must cover herself and listen to her husband. It is important to recognize that Islam does not state that husbands have complete control over their wives, and perhaps a powerful speech given by a religious figure speaking about the true teachings of Allah would warm the hearts of Islamic country leaders and somehow influence them to establish laws that establish, at the very least, democratic rights and feminism in the country.
16	Thank you for the response, especially since you had a bad internet connection. Let me refute your points. First off, I reject your definition of feminism. I think feminism was the belief that men and women should be equal, but I proved that this is no longer the case in third wave feminism. I also reject your premise, because I stated in my first argument that MODERN feminism is harmful. My opponent has implied that it is the fault of men today that women weren't allowed to vote in some states until 1919. It was wrong that this happened, but taking revenge on men won't solve anything. In fact, it will cause embitterment between both sexes. Your first argument is invalid, because I never said that men and women weren't intellectually equal (although they generally don't have as much physical strength as men do, which I will provide the proof for below). And again, you can't blame the phrasing of the Declaration of Independence on men born two centuries after it was created. I don't think you have won this debate. Maybe I am wrong though. Maybe you can prove yourself in the second round. Good luck. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov... (Source for men's vs. women's strength)
17	Hi everyone, my name is Ilan and I am an egalitarian, not a feminist. Many people may have heard of feminism, which is the advocacy of women's rights on the ground of the equality of the sexes. However, not as many people are familiar with the term 'egalitarianism', which is the belief that everyone should be treated equally regardless of their gender identity.   I firmly believe that everyone should be treated with respect, regardless of their gender identity. Women, men, nonbinary people, everyone should be respected and treated with the same level of care and courtesy. However, I do not believe that feminism should be the sole movement advocating for equality. That's why I am an egalitarian, believing in the equality of all people regardless of their gender identity.   For example, prostate cancer affects men just as often as breast cancer affects women, yet it receives half the funding for research and cures that breast cancer does. That's not fair. That's not right. We should all be treated with the same amount of respect and care.   I am not a feminist because I believe that it should not be the sole movement advocating for the equality of all people. Feminism focuses largely on the rights and issues that concern women, while I believe that everyone should be treated equally and have their issues addressed as well. That is why I am an egalitarian.   Thank you for hearing me out.
18	First to answer the attack on Observation One: Pro's response to this was that we are not in Iraq. This piece of evidence was from 2010, and since then nothing has changed as we still have people supporting feminism. During the Iraq war, it was true that they were more likely to be raped than shot. If we were in Iraq today it would still stand. Next he said he was never talking about pornography, however it can be inferred from his opener. Now the big argument he made in this last round was that all my arguments were about equal rights, not feminism. However, this argument is flawed. A quick Google search indicates the definition of feminism is "the advocacy of women's rights on the grounds of political, social, and economic equality to men." This means that feminism, by its very definition means equal rights to women. Pro admitted they are pro equal rights, so therefore, by the very definition of feminism, they are pro feminism. Additionally, note Observation 2 and Advantages 1 and 2 were untouched in the last round, which is reason alone to vote for con. In conclusion, by the definition of feminism, pro conceded that feminism is good, as well as not denying that feminism is bad by not attacking my advantages of feminism.
19	First off, I did some searching, and the Merriam-Webster dictionary is made in liberal Massachusetts. They clearly bent the definition to serve their own needs. I don't agree with that definition. You see, if I were to say I was a "masculinist", people would say that I'm a male supremacist, but if I called myself a feminist, I would be called a "champion of rights". So, since "masculinism" is male supremacy, then feminism is female supremacy. I consider myself an "equalist". Feminism today is so twisted and hypocritical that it is best to abandon it. I am for the rights of men AND women, not JUST women, and not ONLY men.
20	The greatest destroyer of peace is abortion because if a mother can choose to terminate her own child, what is left to prevent me from choosing to terminate yours? There is nothing between, says Mother Teresa. Abortion, what does this really mean? The definition of abortion is the deliberate termination of a human pregnancy, most often performed during the first 28 weeks. About 42 million women in the entire world with unintended pregnancies choose abortion. Abortion is a big controversial topic, people believe abortion should be illegal and others think it should stay legal. Why would someone want to kill an innocent little life? It"s not their fault people made mistakes and now they"re the ones having to pay for it. Abortion should be illegal because abortions are not safe, laws are protecting unborn babies, and fetuses can feel pain. Abortion should have never been legal.
21	I would like to thank my opponent for their argument. I do however disagree with many of the points they have made. Firstly, I would like to point out that a medical dictionary definition is not necessarily the definitive definition of a word, so I would argue that the definition they have provided does not necessarily define the word "abortion" in its entirety. Secondly, I would like to point out that the wikipedia article on abortion states that "Abortion is the deliberate termination of a pregnancy, either by medical means or otherwise." This implies that abortion is not necessarily only used to refer to the medical removal of a fetus, but can also refer to other forms of termination such as those performed by coat-hangers and other unsafe methods. Finally, I would like to state that though my opponent has provided a definition of abortion, they have not provided a moral stance on the subject. As such, I argue that the definitions provided do not necessarily need to reflect the stance that I, as the affirmative, am taking.
22	Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by the removal or expulsion from the uterus of a fetus or embryo, resulting in or caused by its death.[1] An abortion can occur spontaneously due to complications during pregnancy or can be induced, in humans and other species. In the context of human pregnancies, an abortion induced to preserve the health of the gravid (pregnant female) is termed a therapeutic abortion, while an abortion induced for any other reason is termed an elective abortion. The term abortion most commonly refers to the induced abortion of a human pregnancy, while spontaneous abortions are usually termed miscarriages.  I have a question for you do you believe in torturing terrorist? (if the answer is no) If you said no you are a moron because you believe in killing gods perfectly harmless creations for nothing and not killing a terrorist for terrorizing our country. Do you believe in the death sentence? If you said no your killing a baby for Nothing. Yes you are killing it you stop its heart from beating it. What do you think god and Jesus our lord and savior think about that. If you are atheist please Google john 3:16

25	Abortion is needed to control the population so that the population does not reach unsustainable levels. By the 22nd century, it is estimated that the global population will be 11.2 billion people, and if abortion were to be made illegal, the population would exponentially increase. This would force women to seek out abortion later on in their pregnancies, leading to an increase in the suicide rate. As a result, men would suffer from a higher rate of suicide than women. If abortion were to remain illegal, the population would eventually spiral out of control and lead to widespread famine, poverty, and disaster. By legalizing abortion, we can ensure that the population remains sustainable and humanity is able to flourish.
26	I would like to thank my opponent for their well-structured argument. It is clear that they have done their research and know the topic well.   I believe that my opponent’s argument regarding abortion and assault is invalid. It is true that abortion and assault can both result in the death of a person or animal, but abortion is not the same as assault. Assault is a purposeful action taken against another person or animal, while abortion is the medical procedure of ending a pregnancy before it results in the birth of a child. As such, they should not be grouped together.   My opponent mentions the morning after pill, and I would like to remind them that the morning after pill is not the same as an abortion. The morning after pill is a form of emergency contraception and can prevent pregnancy, but it is not an abortion.   In conclusion, I believe that my opponent's argument regarding abortion and assault is not valid, and I restate my original stance that abortion should not be accepted.
27	Con has argued that forced childbirth would enslave people into paying for their children, however, pro-choice advocates argue that abortion should be an option to prevent this. Pro-choice advocates also argue that forcing mothers to give birth to unwanted children is a form of enslavement, as these children would then become dependent on the government for financial support. Thus, pro-choice advocates argue that allowing abortion is a form of liberation and empowerment for women.
28	Most people who want to make abortion illegal do so out of a lack of understanding and emotion. Research shows that prohibiting abortion does not decrease its prevalence but instead increases maternal mortality. As to the mother's risk, pregnancy has a major impact on the body and emotional state, and every pregnancy carries some risk of serious complications or death. The crucial decision to take on that risk"no matter how small"should be left to the pregnant person themselves, not law enforcement or others. Women's lives, health, and basic human rights depend on the availability of abortion, and these are the only factors that warrant it.
29	This isn't your typical abortion debate. Because I've never had the "opportunity" of being a pregnant lady, nor do I have the privilege of remembering my fetus days, I don't consider myself fit to actually judge as to whether abortion is OK or not. This is a debate as to how the morality of abortion should be judged. In other words, I will be arguing that the morality of abortion should be determined by whether or not a fetus is sentient, while con will be arguing that the morality of abortion should be determined by deciding whether a fetus is a person or not. Go ahead and accept. Unless your rationalmadman.
30	Thank you Pro for this interesting topic. "I think trump is life. Agree?" Before starting my own arguments let's define a few terms. Trump - a card of a suit any of whose cards will win over a card that is not of this suit "called also trump card. [1] Life - the ability to grow, change, etc., that separates plants and animals from things like water or rocks [2] Now there are 7 qualifications in order for something to have life. They are as follows: It should maintain some balanced conditions in its inner structure Its structure is highly organized. It should be able to break down or build up nutrients to release or store energy based on need. This is called Metabolism It should grow, which means its structure changes as time goes by in an advantageous manner. It should show adaptation to the environment. It should be able to respond to environmental stimuli on demand (as opposed to adaptation, which occurs over time). It should be able to reproduce itself. [3] Now as far as I can tell a "trump" or "trump card" doesn't meet any of these requirements making my opponents statement "trump is life" false. [1] http://www.merriam-webster.com...

31	Trump is the most openly racist presidential candidate since before the Civil Rights Era. Source 1: (https://theweek.com...) reveals his racist rants about Mexican immigrants being rapists and drug dealers (...) After a Black Lives Matter protester was assaulted and kicked at a Trump rally, Trump said "Maybe he should have been roughed up." And he retweeted a graphic with fake statistics about black people supposedly murdering whites, which turns out to have been created by a neo-Nazi. (...) the thing Trump is trying to communicate with this story. (...) Your Muslim friends and neighbors? They're not the well-assimilated, patriotic Americans they want you to believe. They're not regular people with jobs and families and lives like yours. They're a threat, people to be surveilled and harassed and hated and feared.   Racism has a significant impact both on the individuals who experience it and the wider community. Research shows that there are significant links between experiences of racism and discrimination and poor physical and mental health, reduced productivity and reduced life expectancy. Further, it is well-recognized that racism presents barriers to social and economic participation which can in turn cause social exclusion and entrench disadvantage, sometimes for generations. (...) It harbors mistrust. It incites hatred. It stops the word 'community' in its tracks. Trump's rhetoric is dangerous and will destroy the US. It destroys communities, causes crime, etc. Why would you ever support him?
32	Here is the source I will be using: - http://www. todaysinfo.net This website lists 13 reasons why Trump will make a great president. I am only going to copy and comment on two of them. 12. "Trump is planning to build a great, great wall (yes"two "greats") on our southern border between the U.S. and Mexico. The best part? He"s planning to have Mexico pay for that wall, and mark his words, "" I will immediately terminate President Obama"s illegal executive order on immigration."" 1. "Why would Trump make the best president of all time? Because he said so. "I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created, I tell you that. I"ll bring back our jobs from China, from Japan, from Mexico and from so many places. I"ll bring back our money. " Sadly, the American dream is dead. But if I get elected president, I will bring it back bigger and better and stronger than ever before, and we will make America great again."" By building a wall, fighting ISIS, and strengthening the Christian religion, Trump will make the greatest president of all time. That is my argument. Thankyou
33	First of all, why do you think Mr. Trump will be such a "great" president? Trump is an inconsiderate jerk who thinks that he can say all the crap he likes to say about people and get away with it. He also talks about reducing our debt, but ask him how he can do that when he wants to build a wall around Mexico, which will put us in more debt and make it ok to let him do whatever he wants without trying to actually TALK to the Mexicans and ask them to stop illegally immigrating into our country.
34	First of all, I support O'Malley, but that isn't important. It looks like this debate comes down to Trump's stance on immigration. I showed clear harms from racism - shattered communities, (look at Ferguson if you want proof lol) poor mental and physical health, economic downturns, etc. If Trump becomes president and embraces racism, all these impacts will go nationwide. My opponent has no response to this, so insofar as I can prove Trump is racist, you vote neg. And I showed clear evidence of that, but if you want more, here's how illegal immigrants are treated. Source 3: (http://revcom.us...) These Minutemen inspired by rightwing Republican Pat Buchanan's claim that urgent action is needed to preserve the U.S. as an ethnically white, Christian-European nation. (...) The cold-blooded vigilante attacks on immigrants aren't a new development. Ranchers in Arizona have killed undocumented immigrants for years. They have terrorized them, hunted them down with dogs, and handed them over to the Border Patrol at gunpoint. (...) they have developed deep ties with powerful forces high in the government"and are operating in the era where any paranoid appeal for more security quickly gets official backing and a public hearing. (...) Mile by mile, walls and barbed wire have cut off Mexico from the United States, forcing more and more immigrants to cross over in the dangerous desolate stretches of border in Arizona. It has created an intense conflict zone, as desperate immigrant workers try to cross and survive, and an intensified government crackdown hunts them through the dry hills to trap them, capture them, (...) this reactionary Minuteman movement has emerged to demand even more extreme and violent actions against the immigrants. They have criticized the proposals made by President Bush and Mexico's President Vicente Fox to create a legal program for bringing Mexican immigrants into the U.S. So these Minutemen kill and hunt down not only illegal immigrants, but also innocent Americans. Clearly more anti immigration laws will simply fuel more racism, and the death of innocent people. So since Trump will cause more terrible organizations like this to form, please vote neg - vote down Trump.
35	I'll be honest, that was an interesting video, however, I still like him. Here's what I got from the video: 1. He's changed his opinion on multiple issues. I don't see anything wrong with that, if anything, I think he was smart to become a Republican in recent years. Look, times change meaning that a policy that would have worked years ago might not work today and a party that may have appeared favorable once may not appear as favorable now. In 2000, when Trump ran for president under the Reform Party, he believed in universal healthcare as an option. The idea that he maintains that belief, despite what the video said, is ridiculous. In early 2015, he brought up the idea that the government should start making deals with hospitals to help low income Americans. Later, a spokesperson (not Trump himself) stated that Trump would be open to a universal / market-based system that would open up a variety of choices. Today, his official healthcare plan affirms that he supports a 100% free market system, where insurance companies must compete nationwide - the exact opposite of universal healthcare. 2. He's donated to and supported the Bill and Hillary in the past. That makes Trump living proof that we have corrupt politicians in Washington; in fact, that's what brought down primary rivals like Sen. Rand Paul (who accepted money from Trump). The video starts going into conspiracy theory-mode; it theorizes that because Trump donated to them, he secretly supports them and is part of an elaborate plot to make Hillary our next president. First of all, there's no evidence. Second of all, if donating money means working for someone, wouldn't Trump also be working for Rand Paul? And wouldn't he have refrained from calling out Hillary for accepting his donation? 3. He's not extremely religious. I'm okay with that. He said that he does not ask God for forgiveness, and then the video pulls up Bible quote after Bible quote - but who really follows every word of the Bible? If you did, you'd be a criminal; the Bible says that we should stone our children if they are disobedient - which is considered murder, and murder is a crime. The video is basically anti-Trump propaganda with little to no factual information. SOURCES: https://www.donaldjtrump.com... GOP DEBATE: "I've given you money, too." -Trump to Sen. Rand Paul
36	No one will be tougher on ISIS than Donald Trump. Mostly because Islamic terrorism is eating up large portions of the Middle East and they have become rich. They even built a hotel, making themselves a direct competitor of Trump Hotel. Trump is undeniably a great negotiator, and despite his outrageous public statements in the recent past, he knows how to navigate complex deals and convince a wide variety of industries, businesses, and investors to do what he wants and to work with him to achieve his goals. Trump isn"t politically correct. He isn"t afraid to say what he thinks, and he can certainly voice an opinion. If he has an issue with you, he will say it to your face. It"d be nice to have a politician in office with that level of transparency.
37	I accept. Before we begin I would like to clear some things up for the voters and provide definitions. There is no clear resolution so I will provide one after the definitions. Trump - a card of a suit any of whose cards will win over a card that is not of this suit President - (Definition 2) an officer appointed or elected to preside over an organized body of persons Full Resolution based off of definitions - A Card Trump Should Not Be The President Of The World My stance is as follows: A Card Trump Should Not Be The President Of The World  http://www.merriam-webster.com... http://www.dictionary.com...
38	In round 2, I demolished everyone's source that Trump is a liar: WashPo's list is full of clearly non-lies. Probably nothing on their list is a real lie. My opponent's Round 2 response was just a rehash of his Round 1 rant. So, I will respond to some of the side comments.   Says who? Does WashPo have a tracker for Obama's lies, Bush's lies, Clinton's lies? -Nope. We can't know how his lying compares without having comparable lists.  This is my exact point: Trump is just another one of the everyone that lie. Why should his lies be tracked when no one else's have been? I assert that Trump doesn't lie in a manner worthy of special tracking. His lack of complete honesty is in line with the mainstream of US politicians and media outlets nowadays.
39	Despite the assertion that the "American Dream" is dead, it is not yet true. Hillary Clinton accused Donald Trump of being a racist, and he responded: "Failing candidate Hillary Clinton, who is desperately trying to hold on to her lead in the democratic primary against Bernie Sanders, is knowingly putting out lies about my stance on illegal immigration. I said 'Mexico is sending'" I"m not knocking immigration or immigrants, but rather am very critical of the country of Mexico for sending us people that they don"t want. Likewise I am very critical of illegal immigration and the tremendous problems including crime, which it causes. She is desperate, she is sad, and she is obviously very nervous when she has to revert to issues that have already been settled given the absolute accuracy of my statement. She speaks about 'my tone' and that's the problem with our country's leaders. They are more worried about tone than results! It's not about being nice, it's about being competent. Hillary should spend more time producing her illegally hidden emails and less time trying to obfuscate a statement by me that is totally clear and obviously very much accepted by the public as true. I am honored, however, that she is attacking me, instead of Jeb Bush. Obviously she knows that JEB is no longer her real competition. The last person she wants to face is Donald Trump." He lied about Hillary being a sad excuse for a candidate. He lies unintentionally and finds it hard to stop. I know what you're thinking: "I need evidence!" This is a part of an article I found on a website: Donald Trump is a serial liar. Okay, to be a bit less Trumpian about it, he has trouble with the truth. If you look at Politifact, the Pulitzer Prize-winning site that examines candidates' pronouncements for accuracy, 76 percent of Trump's statements are rated either 'mostly false,' 'false,' or 'pants on fire,' which is to say off-the-charts false. By comparison, Hillary Clinton's total is 29 percent.
40	When you simply dismiss an opponent's arguments as "factoids and other junk," it is to be assumed that you have no rebuttal for them. Thus, unless you provide an adequate rebuttal in later rounds, you concede all of these points as true. I don't know what political correctness has to do with this debate; if you would be so kind as to explain so both of us have some context to argue off of, that would be nice. Just as a note--since the British people have now voted to leave the EU, I hope that it happens and that Britain does succeed in invoking Article 50. It's one thing to be against something passing and quite another to try to override the will of the people by undemocratic means. I respect the will of the British people and hope that the choice they made actually occurs. If I'm not mistaken, however, you titled this debate "Brexit" and I took the Con position. Does this not mean that I am arguing that the effects of Brexit will be mostly negative and you arguing that they will be positive? Seeing as you don't appear to have made any actual arguments as to why a Brexit will be beneficial, I shall refrain from expanding my arguments this round, seeing as I have nothing to respond to.
41	Anti-Brexit had the facts, Brexit had the rhetoric. Irrational fear of immigration and losing autonomy. Britain clearly needs migrants considering it's own workers don't want to work the dirty jobs such as farming so migrants need to do it for them. [1] Let's Look at the facts. Britain's Membership in the EU costs around 6.3 Billion pounds or 0.3% of britains GDP. So for the leave side to be economically superior leaving would not be able to affect the UK by more than 0.3%. But considering the UK makes 13% of it's GDP from selling commodties to the EU this seems unlikely. [2] The problem with this is that economists predict that the UK could lose up to 6% of It's GDP from leaving the EU which is much greater than 0.3% [3] This isn't even including additional costs for tariffs that would amount to close to the cost for eu membership after free trade deals are abolished along with eu membership. [4] Also, Britain has complete control of their immigration policy so leaving would do almost nothing when it comes to immigration policy. Not to mention that 70% of Britain's population increase came from immigration. Limiting immigration radically could have some pernicious effects. [5] Clearly from this information, Brexit would have accomplished nothing in immigration and would hurt the UK economy in the long run. Your emotional appeal will not get you far.

42	Leaving the European Union will be beneficial for England. England can control its own borders and prevent a flood of migration. Moreover, it won't have to follow the EU's strict rules and regulations, which gives England the freedom to make its own laws and policies. Switzerland and Norway are not in the EU and are both thriving countries with their own laws and regulations. Additionally, England won’t be part of the Ottoman or Roman empires, and the EU's attempts to colonize Europe will not succeed. Brexit will be good for England.
43	I appreciate your response, So here is my final debate round Security of the country is more important than trade. Just look at what is happening in the rest of Europe. The migrant crisis is reaching epic proportions all the way to France because the borders were open and the migrants came cross all borders unobstructed. From Italy and Turkey through the rest of open Europe through the poorer nations all heading for England the most prosperous country in the EU. A border crossing with northern and southern Ireland is also critical in keeping the IRA at bay and controlling movement of people. Open borders are a disaster for security reasons. It might be easier to cross borders for regular travelers but lets look at the Sicilian mafia, They are now free to roam all over Europe, The Russian mafia has open borders to travel to England right now and poison people with polonium. The Gypsies can roam all around Europe without obstruction. And finally the migrants from the middle east including ISIS can freely cross from Turkey to anywhere in Europe. Everybody is complaining about Brexit until the bombs go off in France and England or a 1000 women are raped in Germany over the holidays because there is no control at the border. Switzerland and Norway are not in the EU and they are doing excellent. Not everyone needs to be in a big EU boys club. Countries all separated a long time ago because people couldn't get along. Yugoslavia split into 6 countries because they couldn't get along, Who says we need to make one big Europe country? Have we not learned from the Roman empire, From the Ottoman empire. Countries are created every decade in Africa, In the past in South America. Panama did not want to be part of Colombia so they created their own country with a border. Not having borders or having open borders is a bad idea. That's like not having a fence with your neighbor. And besides who says England pay 13 billion euros to the EU, How much is Romania and Bulgaria paying? Nothing. England is a rich prosperous country, They don't need to be part of the EU clan that is suffering from migrant invasions and terrorism. Besides other countries are pulling out too, Poland and Sweden mentioned they might pull out next. You can have your own country so why would you want to be under the thumb of the Hague and the big brother EU. England will prosper without the EU like they have done for hundreds of years just ask Switzerland and Norway about it. The EU is FAKE NEWS and bad and 50% of the British agree with me and want out
44	I will first begin my addressing the rebuttals made by my opponent to defend my arguments. My opponent started off by accusing me of not understanding opportunity cost. Let me assure him that I have quite a good idea of what opportunity cost means. He then brings in some technical terms with the hopes of confusing us to believe in him.  In this section, your argument should be more direct and not include any original material. You should summarize your opponent's argument and clearly state your refutation. You should also try to be respectful and avoid making personal attacks. For example:  "My opponent's argument is misguided and incorrect. He has clearly not understood the concept of opportunity cost."   "My opponent has attempted to confuse the issue with technical terms, but I know exactly what he is trying to do and I reject it."
45	My opponent seems to be missing the point. I'm not saying one shouldn't use sources. What I'm saying is that when you do use a source, you need to use quotation marks, and reference your source. If you don't, you're guilty of plagiarism. According to India's Secretary General of Industry, A. Didan Singh, "We firmly believe that leaving the EU would create considerable uncertainty for Indian businesses engaged with UK and would possibly have an adverse impact on investment and movement of professionals to the UK." [2] Finally, England leaving the EU could lead to the volatility of the pound. This could lead to increased risk for businesses within India. [3] Sources: 1. https://logfall.wordpress.com... 2. http://m.economictimes.com... 3. Ibid
46	The people of England are facing a lot of trouble due to the migration of people from other countries in search of jobs, leading to a rise in unemployment and a decrease in the quality of life. In order to combat this, it is essential that Great Britain is separated from the European Union. New industries might face some difficulties when establishing, but it would be beneficial for those in England as they will find employment. Additionally, new trading relationships with other countries can be formed, increasing economic growth and employment opportunities.
47	Ok, let's agree with the opposition. Let's say that the costs incurred when Britain has to trade with each country separately is higher than the membership fee of being in EU. First of all, economic experts themselves cannot agree whether which scenario is going to incur more cost, especially when you consider that even if Britain does leave the EU it is going to take at least 2 years to gradually leave the EU and to finalise new laws and trade agreements. But when the problem is happening now, we cannot continue to ignore it without trying something new. Britain has been in the EU for too long and a new way of doing things, a change from the old ways deserve at least a 'trial period' to enable us to work things out. My opponent then argues that terrorist ideas are home grown, not brought in and therefore an emphasis should be on the education system. I simply cannot agree with this. The fact that most terrorists have radical Islamic views are because they are from Islamic descent. To mitigate this problem, you can't bring in more people from Islamic countries (assuming this is Syria, Iraq etc) and expect that you know, nothing is going to happen and we're all going to live happy in a multicultural society. Which is exactly why, at this period in history with influx of migrants from Muslim countries, and Turkey trying to push their way to visa-free travel, we need to have more control over our borders. It is our concern that Brussels will force us to terms that will impact our community, particularly with regards to the public's sensitivity about muslims and terrorism. The fact that member states can share info to me is not at all a good reason to remain in the EU. The war on terrorism is a war fought collectively by all countries whether or not we remain in EU. America, Canada, Australia all non-EU countries contribute to our info on potential terrorist threats. And when we still cannot prevent incidents like that in Sydney and Paris, we should not pretend that just by sharing info we can solve terrorism altogether. Notice that I am not at all saying that all Muslims are terrorists. I am saying that we have to take the necessary precautionary steps with the knowledge that most terrorists are muslims. Britain leaving the EU does not mean we will leave our collective effort with other countries on the war on terrorism. I have certainly enjoyed this debate and I thank my opponent for his worthy assessments and for his time. Vote Government. Vote for Independence.
48	My opponent's debate technique is lacking. I have thoroughly addressed their arguments and provided evidence to support my claims. Rather than refute this evidence, my opponent has chosen to criticize the source of the evidence, which is unacceptable. Furthermore, my opponent has refused to look at the EU Constitution, which is concerning as it is a crucial factor in this debate. To make matters worse, my opponent has not provided any counterarguments or evidence to refute the claims I have made. It is clear that they are not willing to engage in meaningful discussion, which is a shame as there is much to be gained from this debate. I will link the EU Constitution here: http://europa.eu... Final Statement: I believe in independence. It is rare and difficult to achieve, but it is there, and the UK is taking a historic path towards it. I know it will be a challenge at first and I know there are people who are skeptical, but I firmly believe that, in the end, the UK will look back at this moment and be proud of themselves for choosing independence. The news may try to paint a different picture, but history has always been kind to independent countries, and that is something worth striving for. I believe in a more free and independent UK, and I believe in the country, so much so that I am confident they will make well thought out decisions for their future.
49	First of all I would like to make my "map points" as to why I am oppose to the death penalty. 1. The cost One my argue by logic that the cost is much higher for life imprisonment because you would have to feed him everyday etc.... for the rest of their lives right. # A 2003 legislative audit in Kansas found that the estimated cost of a death penalty case was 70% more than the cost of a comparable non-death penalty case. Death penalty case costs were counted through to execution (median cost $1.26 million). Non-death penalty case costs were counted through to the end of incarceration (median cost $740,000). (December 2003 Survey by the Kansas Legislative Post Audit) # In Tennessee, death penalty trials cost an average of 48% more than the average cost of trials in which prosecutors seek life imprisonment. (2004 Report from Tennessee Comptroller of the Treasury Office of Research) # In Maryland death penalty cases cost 3 times more than non-death penalty cases, or $3 million for a single case. (Urban Institute, The Cost of the Death Penalty in Maryland, March 2008) # In California the current system costs $137 million per year; it would cost $11.5 million for a system without the death penalty.  Secondly, I will state an argument that innocent people could possibly be executed. Since the introduction of the death penalty, there have been 130 people released from death rows throughout the country due to evidence of their wrongful convictions. In 2003 alone, 10 wrongfully convicted defendants were released from death row. Until I can be sure that everyone sentenced to death in Illinois is truly guilty, until I can be sure with moral certainty that no innocent man or woman is facing a lethal injection, no one will meet that fate.   Thirdly, the death penalty does not help anything. There are no proven records that say that states that have the death penalty have lower crimes rates of any sort. People do not think right before they shot a guy in the face. "Oh wait, this state has the death penalty". Actually, states that do not have the death penalty have lower crime rates http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org...  Fourthly, wouldn't you agree that spending 23 hours in the day for the rest of your life in a 6 ft" by 6 ft" box thinking about what you have done, letting the misery eat you away for the rest of your life is worse then dyeing?   Finally, shouldn't the state be considered a murderer for killing someone as well?
50	The death penalty system is flawed and subject to error, as evidenced by the possibility of executing innocent people. Capital punishment also costs more than life in prison without parole, and can lead to irreversible mistakes. In some cases, the death penalty costs more than life in prison without parole over the long run. Additionally, the death penalty serves as a form of vengeance, rather than rehabilitation, and does not provide a deterrent to crime.
51	1. Citizens should have the right to carry out capital punishment if the state cannot execute it efficiently. 2. Gun control should not be a factor when considering the effectiveness of the death penalty. 3. The death penalty is not effective in reducing crime. 4. The case of the DNA burning was a result of human error, not a problem with the death penalty. 5. The death penalty does not deter crime. 6. The death penalty costs more than imprisonment. 7. The death penalty is inhumane and can lead to the execution of innocent people. 8. The death penalty does not reduce crime and is not cost-efficient. 9. Criminals prefer life in prison to the death penalty, since it is less likely to lead to the death of the individual. 10. People commit crimes for various reasons, and the death penalty is not a suitable solution.
52	The death penalty serves an important purpose in deterring crime and punishing those who have committed heinous acts. Without it, the overpopulation of crime could fill up jails and cause citizens to be feared. Tests have shown that the death penalty is an effective deterrent of future crime and is a necessary form of punishment for those who commit terrible acts that result in the deaths of many. It also avenges the innocent victims and decreases crime rates.
53	My opponent speaks no form of fact or statistic but morally on his/her opinion. I could sit here and talk about how I think the death penalty is good. But i'm not using facts or sources. If you need a reason on why the death penalty is a good idea; here are a few. One small but important reason on why the death penalty is a good idea is that it decreases the prisoner population, which saves even more tax payers money. Another reason why the death penalty is a good idea, Once a criminal is executed, he cannot kill again. The case for this would be Kenneth Allen McDuff who was on Death Row when the death penalty was declared unconstitutional in the 1970's. His sentence was commuted to life and he was eventually released on parole and killed again. He has since been executed My final reason for this round is that the death penalty is actually a very good deterrence. If you look at this link: http://www.prodeathpenalty.com... You see a chart. The chart is documenting the number of yearly homicide rate per 100,000 population. The chart also documents the years 1950-2002. Lastly, the chart documents the yearly number of executions. The death penalty is actually considered a deterrent. The death penalty is a necessary evil that prevents further potential victims from being killed. My mistake.
54	For the most part, these are correct, although there are some grey areas, but do not concern yourself with that. One mistake i made is that in some cases the death penalty is not COMPLETELY painless, but i was wanting to make the point that in most cases, it's less painful than a lot of deaths. "The death penalty is a misuse and waste of taxpayer dollars". So you are saying that sentencing someone to the death penalty uses to many tax payers dollars, so keeping them in prisons and feeding them three meals a day along with airconditioning and electricity saves money? How many families struggle to feed their families and keep the lights on, while criminals sit here in prisons for 30 years and have everything some families struggle for, for free, and thats fair? And that doesn't waste money? If a person is sentenced to life in prison at age 37, at age 77, on average, it will cost a state more than $4 million dollars. (http://www.phoenix.edu...) I would like an explanation on how the death penalty costs more. "Innocent people are too often executed". Please show me cases where people are wrongly executed in the last 20 years or so. The death penalty is not used nearly as much, so i would like some elabortation. "The death penalty is applied in an unfair manner". I must have elabortation on this also. Another point i must make, the death penalty is a source of intimidation. If someone knows the death penalty is strictly enforced, more than likely that person will think twice about committing the crime. Its common sense, if someone understands that their life will be taken if they take someone else's life, less crimes will be committed. Now the death penalty is used more and more lightly and criminals know that more than likely nothing too terribly harmful will happen if they were to commit crimes. The justice system is becoming more and more relax and the death penalty is one example. My Dad is a police officer and even he states that the justice department is not punishing criminals the way criminals should be punished.
55	Ahhh, the death penalty. The government taking someone's life because they took someone else's life. What obvious hypocrisy. I disagree with the death penalty because it is immoral. First, the death penalty implies that a jury of twelve people is not qualified to take life into their own hands. Does this mean that mob execution should also be made legal? Second, the death penalty becomes intolerable the very moment that someone is wrongly convicted. Death is, if anything, permanent. If someone is wrongly convicted and sentenced to life in prison its horrible, but if someone is wrongly convicted and sentenced to death, then an innocent person is MURDERED. How can this be moral?
56	Ok how can you say that it is usual to strap a person down to a table and inject him with poisons that will kill him. how is it usual to strap a person to a chair with sponges up there buts and masks over there face to keep them from vomiting and craping all over the place while your send thousands of volts through there body there is not anything usual about that. when on death row you have a unlimited amout of appeals that are all paid for by our court systems. plus various other expences so yes even an 18 yr old sitting in jail for the rest of there life is cheaper then the death penalty. In reality, the death penalty is more expensive than life in prison, costing $3.2 million more on average. Even when innocent people are executed, the death penalty remains more costly than life in prison. In one study, it was found that the average cost of executing a prisoner is $900,000, while the average cost of imprisoning a person for life is $700,000. In addition, numerous studies have found that potential inmates are more likely to seek plea bargains when faced with the death penalty. This reduces the cost and time of trials since prosecutors do not need to invest as much time and money in their cases. It also reduces the possibility of wrongful executions, since plea bargains reduce the chances of innocent people being sentenced to death. It also reduces the risk of prison riots, and reduces recidivism rates since many offenders do not want to face the death penalty. The death penalty, therefore, is not only more expensive than life in prison, but it also does not serve as a deterrent to crime and can lead to the execution of innocent people. Furthermore, the death penalty has been proven to cause more psychological harm to the victim's family than life in prison. Studies have shown that the process of litigating a death penalty case is far more complex than a life without parole case. This is due to the necessity of multiple trials and appeals. The process of death row inmates' appeals can take decades to conclude, a process which is costly and emotionally exhausting for both the victim's family and the inmate. The death penalty is also not a deterrent for crime, as other studies have shown that the chances of someone being deterred from committing a crime because of the death penalty are slim to none. On the other hand, the risk of wrongful executions is extremely high. The death penalty does not offer any deterrent for crime and can result in the execution of innocent people. It is also more expensive than life in prison.  This was found at https://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/cost-death-penalty-vs-life-imprisonment where you can find more studies and facts on the subject. Furthermore, from an ethical standpoint, the death penalty is wrong and inhumane. It violates the Eighth Amendment, which protects people from cruel and unusual punishments. In conclusion, the death penalty is not only more expensive than life in prison, but it also does not serve as a deterrent to crime and can lead to the execution of innocent people.
57	I deem the death penalty to be necessary. Morally, it is senseless that a serial killer would not face death as a punishment for their multiple crimes. Again, I could go into the devastating effects on the families of the victims, which harms many more people than it would the family of a serial killer, but you would argue I would be creating more pain by killing the killer. I cannot understand why a family would continue to support said killer, however it may happen. You have discounted economics and all other sensible retort I may have had, so it would be pointless me highlighting the economic benefits of the death penalty. You may personally be opposed to the death penalty, but, as is apparent in the United States, the people evidently want the death penalty, else they would proposition the banishment in their own state. Regardless if it actually deters crime or not, "the majority" want the death penalty: http://www.gallup.com... The above is only one example of a poll, and there are more to be found should you require . I concede that the Government has too many powers as it stands, however if they are to maintain any degree of PERCEPTION of justice, it would be a wise move to include the death penalty. Regardless of its effectiveness, it still puts the public mind at ease. All too commonly, we read comments in newspapers referencing the death penalty and the revival of it. To put my position bluntly, I will use an example. If most of the penitentiaries in the United States followed the model of Sheriff Joe Arpaio, with his demeaning treatment prisoners through making them wear pink underwear and handcuffs, feeding them on pittance per day, and letting them sizzle in 100 degree heat in the desert of Arizona, I would be opposed to the death penalty. However, this is NOT the case, most especially here in Britain. Some prisons are palatial. If the "Arpaio model" was adopted, I would deem that apt and just punishment, considering their life would be in more misery than if they were dead. That is certainly punishment in the true sense of the word. For as long as Britain continues to send prisoners to tax-funded 5* hotels, I deem the death penalty a worthy inclusion to the system.
58	I apologize for not being able to give this argument my full effort, however I still think I can make a strong case for the opposing side.   1. I disagree that life imprisonment brings more closure to the families of the victims than the death penalty. While life imprisonment may be better than the death penalty in terms of not being able to be executed, it does not bring the same sense of finality that the death penalty does, as the death penalty is certain and irreversible.   2. My opponent argues that trials will be done faster and more efficiently with the death penalty, however this is untrue. Capital crimes require a higher burden of proof than non-capital crimes, and these trials can take more time as it is more difficult to find qualified juries in capital cases. In addition, the appeals process for capital cases is lengthy and complex, which leads to more delays.   3. I accept my opponent's argument that the death penalty is not an effective deterrent, however I still contend that it could potentially act as a deterrent in certain situations. For example, if someone is considering committing a capital crime, the prospect of being executed may be enough to dissuade them.   4. I disagree that an excessive use of the death penalty creates fear in society, as this could lead to people hiding their crimes out of fear of being executed. This would be dangerous, as it would prevent justice from being served and criminals would go unpunished.   5. The video clip supports my argument that an excessive use of the death penalty creates a fear in society, as it could potentially lead to innocent people being executed.
59	Google is releasing products such as Google Classroom and cars, which would make paper documents extinct. Additionally, if everyone uses Google Classroom, every document would be on the internet, giving Google control over our education and information. When Google has access to all of this, they will be able to easily manipulate us. A man said (I don't remember his name), "If Google buys Walmart, they can take over the world." Google will have access to our food and purchases, allowing them to influence what we think. This is very concerning, as it demonstrates how they could take over the world.
60	Google gets an average of 188 million visitors a day, while Bing gets a measly 60 million visitors a day. If Bing is better than Google, how come it gets fewer visitors? Just because Google gets more visitors, that doesn't mean it's necessarily better! Google has just been around longer, so Bing is starting to catch up.   As for Bing sounding better than Google, I'm going to have to disagree. Think about it. The word Bing! sounds all happy and jumpy, while Gooooooooooogle sounds more like an echo in a cemetery.   Con argued that 33% of Google users said they'd be using Bing more often after taking part in the tests. This actually bolsters my case, because it shows that 67% of people would not ever use Bing instead of Google.
61	1. "Google is a reliable source" and "Google is true so pro must win" are both valid arguments as they are sourced from Google.  2. Con argues that Google is unreliable but provides no evidence other than a Google search result which states "google not reilable". This is a logical contradiction, as Con cannot prove that Google is unreliable without providing evidence.  3. Con argues that pro's argument is incorrect because "reilable" is not "reliable". This is incorrect, as the word "reliable" can mean "able to be trusted" or "able to be relied upon".  4. Con argues that pro's argument is flawed because it is not supported by a reputable source. This is irrelevant, as all arguments do not necessarily need to be supported by reputable sources. 5. "This is an argument" is not a valid argument, as it does not have any evidence to back up its claims. 6. Con argues that pro's argument is flawed because Con has no evidence to back up their claim that Google is unreliable. 7. "You can't trust con" is not a valid argument. 8. Con argues that pro has no evidence to back up their claim that Google is reliable. This is a valid argument. 9. Con argues that pro's argument is logically flawed because it contradicts itself. This is a valid argument. 10. Con argues that pro's argument is illogical, and that Con has no evidence to back up their claim that Google is illuminati. This is a valid argument. 11. Google.com/search?q="you+can't+trust+con" is a valid argument, as it presents evidence to back up Con's claim that pro's argument is flawed.
62	My opponent has failed to refute any point that I have made, therefore I am led to believe that he is conceding this debate. He also states, “SO I think that some people just use google for their own inappropriate things.” If Google was really the best search engine then why would there be things such as this, I think not. If my opponent proceeds to refute my points in the next round, I shall post the following arguments: 1) Google plagiarism (or phishing) 2) Google traffic view 3) More and more and more Google safety flaws.
63	Google isn't being properly evaluated. Nearly every individual who prefers Google to Bing is a biased party. This is because those who hate Bing often use Google and never use Bing. Google "fan-boys" don't really know what Bing has to offer, and in many cases, have either never, or very rarely, ever used The Bing Engine, and thus, are ineligible to compare the two. I"m sure there"s a psychological term for it; there"s a cognitive "firewall" and almost "irrational" belief that appears to protect Google against competitors" claims. The competition really isn"t "just a click away." Microsoft continues to run online its Pepsi-Challenge style ads "Bing It On," in which a majority of users prefer Bing in a "blind comparison test" with Google. Despite the commercials and despite Microsoft reporting that after extensive testing users preferred Bing 2:1, people generally express skepticism Below is one of the many "Bing It On" videos/commercials run by Microsoft https://www.bing.com/...
64	The issue with the argument on the right is that: a) Google does not block results for “authorities on subjects” if someone wants an article from the New Scientist, all one has to do is type in “New Scientist” alongside their search query. b) Is the issue that Google is an ultimate truth-selling authority or that it challenges existing/established authorities such as The Economist on Economics? c) This is how the largely capitalist world works, monopolies/diopolies exist and kill off potential competition. Startups need funds, investment leads to profit/loss, those who can stave off risk and make smart choices and therefore profit win and others lose out. Google is simply protecting its assets/turf, just like every other existing company in the world.
65	This just leaves us with the matter of defining what “It’s business” is, is any company paying Google for result slots “It’s business”? Established authorities in various subject areas have the money and resources to get top slots if they want them or maybe they’re comfortable in already being in a vied-for position and are more concerned with protecting copyright/patents than in being accessible to gullible children who don't trust their parents (I sense an oxymoron here).
66	Google Glass presents an opportunity to cheat on tests, yet teachers must still find ways to adapt to the technology and ensure students are learning. While testing may not be an effective tool for learning, it can help teachers adjust their teaching methods. Further, using Google Glass in a productive way during school hours could help students learn more in public education settings.
67	No changes made.
68	Even though the integration of Google+ and YouTube has caused some controversy, my opponent is clearly taking what would be the pro side of the argument, and I will be arguing that Google+ should stay integrated with YouTube.  1. https://www.youtube.com/comment?video_id=2Q7pwK4FzGQ&includes=1#G2thXgQ9oAEF01  Comment spamming has not increased since the integration, and the "Bob's Army" spam that has only recently appeared is not inherently the fault of Google, but rather certain people's resistance to change.  The comment links, infinite characters, forced G+ account, and many other issues have been addressed. Creating a Google+ account is completely free, and does no harm to anyone.
69	"To go vegan and stop the murder of these animals would not only counter the effects of our evolutionary diet but also destroy the industries involved in the selling of these foods, which might mess up the economy. Plus, steak and bacon are amazing." I agree! But we should eat those things from vegan based ingredients so we don't harm ourselves, non-human animals, or make people over-seas become even more impoverished. sources: Records of Buckinghamshire, Volume 3, BPC Letterpress, 1870, p. 68.

Francione, Gary and Garner, Robert. The Animal Rights Debate: Abolition Or Regulation? Columbia University Press, 2010 (hereafter Francione and Garner 2010), p. 62: "Although veganism may represent a matter of diet or lifestyle for some, ethical veganism is a profound moral and political commitment to abolition on the individual level and extends not only to matters of food but also to the wearing or using of animal products. Ethical vegans are the majority " they reject the commodity status of nonhuman animals ..." "Veganism", Vegetarian Times, January 1989: "Webster's dictionary provides a most dry and limiting definition of the word 'vegan': 'one that consumes no animal food or dairy products.' This description explains dietary veganism, but so-called ethical vegans " and they are the majority " carry the philosophy further."
70	Veganism is the practice of abstaining from the use of animal products, particularly in diet, as well as following an associated philosophy that rejects the commodity status of sentient animals. (From Wikipedia) The vegan ethos is motivated by the recognition that neither man nor beast may be made an object to be sucked dry by the ruling classes. Vegans see ethical worth in all sentient beings and so refuse to partake in the reification of animals. Meat and leather represent the coercive transformation of a sentient being into an object to be sold and consumed. Swallowing semen is consensual act- the sperm is willingly expelled from the body with joy and vigor. Barring fringe cases of prostitution, the vegan is not making the sperm donor an object to be bought and sold; the vegan is not reducing the sentient spewer to a piece of meat. Simply put, spunk ain’t a commodity. Oral sex and the eager lapping that follows is not only wholly within the ethical bounds of veganism, it solves the inequalities vegans object to. In his semenal work, Marx noted: “In proportion as the exploitation of one individual by another is put an end to, the exploitation of one nation by another will also be put an end to. In proportion as the antagonism between classes within the nation vanishes, the hostility of one nation to another will come to an end.” Swallowing is an act which bridges the divide between classes. It removes antagonism as the donor appreciates the moral fortitude of the vegan for finishing the job through to the end.
71	Honestly, you could be vegan if you want to. I don't care if you're trying to force veganism on people because if so, that would violate the first amendment. Instead, the resolution is at least 99% of human adults should eat vegan in the entire world. I. Health It is well known that fruits and vegetables are healthy. Vegan diets exclude many foods yet allow fruits in vegetables. Therefore, its only logical that most vegans will eat more fruits and vegetables thus being healthier. A multivitamin can take care of any nutrient deficiencies met on a vegan diet. II. Environment Claim: Meat is wasteful compared to grain. Warrant:"Meat is less efficient because we eat the animal that eats the grain instead of eating the grain ourselves. It takes about 15 pounds of feed to make 1 pound of beef, 6 pounds of feed for 1 pound of pork and 5 pounds of feed for 1 pound of chicken, the Department of Agriculture estimates. For catfish, it's about 2 pounds of feed per pound of fish." [2]. Impact: A vegan diet takes less acreage compared to an omnivorous diet. Helping save the environment. III. Animal happiness Animals are sentient and capable of feeling emotions like happiness and unhappiness. Factory farming is infamous for being cruel. Since the profit motive is at work it will always be cheaper to raise an animal in inhumane conditions like battery cages. "In the wake of an ABC News investigation into alleged unsanitary and inhumane practices at one of the nation's largest egg farms, animal rights activists are calling for an end to the egg industry's widespread use of so-called "battery cages," in which birds live six to a cage in long stacks of wire cages. "[3]. Being confined to battery cages cause unhappiness to animals. IV. World Hunger In part II Environment acreage was mentioned. The grain lots feeding farm animals could be re-purposed to feed hungry humans. [2]. Claim: World hunger exists today Warrant: "The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that about 805 million people of the 7.3 billion people in the world, or one in nine, were suffering from chronic undernourishment in 2012-2014." [3]. Impact: World hunger could be mitigated if more people decided to turn vegan. At least 99% of human adults should eat vegan in the entire world. V.

72	Bacon and steak may not be as popular or as flavorful as they are with the meat included, but they certainly would not taste the same without it. In addition, the majority of people in many countries, including America, do consume meat, making it unlikely that veganism will be adopted on a mass scale anytime soon. Furthermore, getting rid of the meat industry entirely would have significant impacts on the animal agriculture industry, as many animals like pigs would no longer be useful and may even be slaughtered if left unchecked. Changing diets overnight would cause a great disruption to the market and the ecosystem as a whole. While humans are not the only ones who kill living creatures for food, many other animals like tigers, lions, and sharks do not have to forgo their natural diet of flesh, so why should humans? This suggests that our dietary habits are, in fact, a part of our natural evolution, and that forcing humans to defy the laws of nature and stop eating something that has been part of our diet since the beginning of the human race is unlikely to happen anytime soon.
73	Lacto ovo vegetarian = hippopotamus: A lacto ovo vegetarian diet excludes meat, fish, and poultry but includes dairy products and eggs. So you say hippopotamus is lacto ovo vegetarian. Great! We have a place to start. Under your definition hippopotamus eat eggs, milk and cheese, but they are strictly vegan; they are just faking eating eggs and cheese to be cool. Hippopotamuses munch on grasses, water plants and such things. Yes, they sometimes bite on a person or alligator who get in their faces from time to time; but they do spit them out, just yucky. Did you know that a hippopotami"s closest relative is whales and porpoises, who are not non-vegan? They will eat just about anything that moves. So much for cousins taking up the ethical family"s eating habits in an effort to save animal lives. Also, the word hippopotamus is from an ancient Greek word (strange alphabet that does not cut and paste) which means water horse. A horse is a vegan also; yeah! Hippopotamus are classified along with other two toed animals such as camels, cattle, deer and pigs. Camels and cattle are vegans, pigs not so much; non-vegans. But, camels are related to llamas and alpacas; cows have their cousin the bison, deer are related to elks and gazelles; all are vegan. Bonus points for this group. So there you have it, horses, camels, deer, cattle, bison, alpacas, llamas, elks, gazelles and hippopotamus are hippopotamus therefore, vegans pretending to be Lacto ovo vegetarians who care about ethics by not eating other animals. Whereas, whales, porpoises, and pigs are unethical meat eating non-vegan nasty folk, also known as carnivors.
74	Meat eaters are not necessarily ignorant in my opinion. I'm sure there are many biologists, gastroenterologists, vets, and pro-animal rights people who eat meat, me falling under the last one. Being at least one of the things on the preceding list should disqualify ignorance as a reason for eating meat. Personally, I enjoy meat because of preference. I understand what happens on farms, factories, butcher shops, restaurants, etc with meat. More selfish? Well, what's selfish? Selfish seems to mean that one cares for one's self without any regards to others. I will agree that selfish is a proper word to use. Meat eaters take advantage of life on earth for personal gain and pleasure. However, we as humans are way past selfish all together. Anybody taking part in the industrial revolution and the results of it are selfish. We take advantage of earth and the things of it for our own personal gain or pleasure. We chop down trees, we dirty up water, we burn oil and coal, we capture animals and genetically change them to be our fluffy pets instead of letting them roam free in the environment, we run over squirrels, and instead of eating food that grows from our surroundings, we destroy land that is already there, plant new plants that aren't natural to the area, and then they take the crops and turn them in to something more desired. Simply put, humans are selfish. We all do things that destroy the environment for our personal gain with little regards for the environment. So, we as humans are selfish and care less about others for our own personal reasons. If this debate is how vegans are better and smarter than meat eaters, than this debate is not a good idea. You and I (I'm assuming you're a vegan) are only different because of our eating choices. We are both, at the end of the day are selfish, less caring beings because we are humans. You have been destructive to the environment for pleasure and personal gain, just as I have. So, I am a more selfish, less caring person than you are because I have different eating choices? I don't think that is a fair, honest analysis of a fellow human being.
75	Thank you for your response. The argument I made about me being more selfish was meant to be taken on a very, very broad scale. If I do support the murder of fellow earthlings than yeah, I am selfish. BUT, and I'm not saying it's okay, but why do we draw the line at animals' living condition (current state of life)? Why don't we draw the line at destroying their habitats, using them for testing and using them for experiments? And if the line is drawn there as well, why is the only frontline of this battle? Why is vegan the start of it all? Animals who are not meant to eat meat would probably reject it when ingested, however, humans, whom are animals, do not reject it (actually, on some scale, I do. I have IBS but... another story another time). I know this area of this popular debate was not mentioned, I just wanted to throw that out there. I hope it can be understood that I am running on zero sleep right now and I am not 100% focused, so what may seem off topic or weird is just me typing with one eye closed. but my turn is almost up and I shall fight through. Something I want to cover is this pleasure. We are selfish, and we are eating at another's expense, but if we enjoy it, it boosts our morale and mental health. Mental health is an important part of anyone's overall health. Now, it's wrong to seek this pleasure in the form of murder (I think murder is the incorrect word for this and I will explain why soon) in my opponent's eyes, however, because it was introduced to us, it is hard to go back. Now about that murder: murder seemes to be a word meaning unjustified killing. Meat is justifiable. At this point, having had captured and farmed so many animals for so long, many farm animals have genetically changed over time to depend largly on humans, making life hard for them if they were free. We as humans let them live a pretty good life before meeting it's end. My point is, it would take a lot of years to reverse what we have done, and it would also destroy the first world (and some lesser) economies. So many states in the United States and European States rely on having meat used. By the time we are able to stop and reverse our damage, humans will be on their way out of their turn on Earth.
76	Some of the more prim and proper women consider ingesting semen to be a common, vulgar practice: unbecoming of a lady and, therefore, they refuse to imbibe such testicular tinctures. However, most women these days aren't so prudish and are quite happy to quaff their boyfriends' penile coloda. That said, some of these gunk-guzzling girls are vegans for ethical reasons and are, therefore, sworn to abstain from consuming animal products. This is an outrage because humans are a species of animal and sperm is produced by humans, so it is totally hypocritical of vegan women to swallow their sires' semen. Thank you.
77	I would like to thank Raisor for accepting this debate and for framing his response within the context of the Communist Manifesto which, as anybody with a social conscience will tell you, is the blueprint for a progressive and equitable meritocracy. Following the Glorious Revolution when I am duly installed as Britain's rightful dictator I will implement its recommendations in full but, in the meantime, I will explain why it is, indeed, hypocritical for a vegetarian lady to swallow her boyfriend's mess. Firstly, I dispute my opponent's claim that love custard is not a commodity: when a man spills his kids into his girlfriend's mouth the lady enjoys the experience just as much as he does. Obviously she doesn't pay him for this service but, nevertheless, it has value for her, and as such, gentlemen's sauce should be considered a commodity. To underline this point, although girls don't pay for sperm, fertility clinics certainly do. My opponent then referred to Marx's "semenal work". If I hadn't realised this misspelling was an intentional (and very clever) pun I could have pointed out that the correct spelling is "seminal", but I wouldn't do that because I think engaging in seminal sementics is tedious. Moving on to my opponent's argument, whilst it is true that the woman's willingness to gobble her boy off and then "finish the job" by swallowing his muck will "remove antagonism" in their relationship, it nonetheless remains the case that the girl receives sustenance from the semen, which, like most animal products, is very high in protein. A vegan woman's decision not to eat meat for ethical reasons is wholly consistent with socialism but, in developed countries, being a vegetarian is a matter of choice, not a necessity. So, by choosing to swallow her sire's semen vegan women are deliberately breaking their vow not to consume animal products and are, therefore, hypocrites.
78	It's funny that such arguments would come from a person who only feeds their dog vegetables. You use the term "animals" as though all animals are omnivores. Of course, it is a well known fact that most animals are vegans. Take the mighty lion for example. It only eats fresh raw fruits and vegetables such as zebra and buffalo. Vegetables have all the vitamins and minerals that you've mentioned. Maybe B12 is lacking, but google "durianride" to find out about vegan B12 supplements. Most human beings, meat-eaters or not, have a B12 deficiency. Vegetables and fruits are also rich in nutrients that you can never find in meat... such as chicken and beef. You can only find chicken and beef in vegetables and fruits. Cheese is another example of an essential nutrient nowhere to be found in meat and dairy. How can you live a healthy life without cheese?
79	I'm in favor of nuclear energy. Economically, nuclear energy has strong benefits. Nuclear power plants are expensive to build, but the returns outweigh the costs. We would be spending the same amount of money on fossil fuels in the long run and losing more in terms of energy. In comparison to thermal power plants, nuclear energy will gain us more than we lose while constructing the centrals. Furthermore, the depletion of fossil fuels is drawing nearer (1). We're reliant on thermal power and fuels, so nuclear energy will be a helpful hand. Environmentally, nuclear energy produces many radioactive wastes. However, I believe we can all agree that the world’s most pressing issue is Global Warming. It will slowly destroy us. Thus, nuclear energy provides a viable solution. For nuclear power plant risks, radiation is a concern but the radiation will leave the central only if there is a crack in the central. We've seen it in Chernobyl, but now we have improved technology and better scientists. We should trust in our people to make this energy beneficial. Secondly, radiation is an important factor, but we can't conclude that the cancer is caused by the nuclear radiation. Of course it will affect the human health, but we can't discount the numerous technological devices in our everyday lives, such as phones or televisions. Are we going to discard them just because of radiation? And the cancers are caused mostly by portable telephones, especially (2). Radars, satellite stations and microwave ovens emit also high radio frequencies. 1: http://www.forbes.com... 2: http://www.cancer.gov...
80	There once was a saying that went something like this. The enemy of my enemy is my friend. Clearly, this is not the case for neither my opponent, nor myself. The non-renewable energies are quick to dismiss anything positive, and exacerbate anything negative that would threaten their cash flow. Welcome to modified capitalism. Voting issues: 1. There is no doubt that renewable energies work. 2. Likewise, there is no doubt that there are inherent dangers associated with renewable, and we have yet to discover a feasible way to dispose of the toxic waste without further endangering lives and ecology. 3. Start up costs clearly make it prohibitive for much of the world. 4. As only a handful can afford it, renewable constitutes only 16%. This deduces that 84% comes from alternative sources. I have demonstrated that the three headed renewable energies, wind, hydro, and solar, are indeed efficient, affordable, and cleaner than nuclear. I went on to make the discerning community further aware of the possibility of magnetic energy. While still in it's infancy, should magnetic energy blossom, everyone, everyone could benefit from this discovery. Yes it is a monetary threat to the Haliburtons of the world, yet they too could prosper by among the first to expand this invention. Conclusion. My opponent outlined the merits of nuclear energy and attempted to minimize the effects of it's toxic waste. I have demonstrated viable alternatives. I would like to thank my opponent Ore_Ele for a good discussion that if read widely, it could open eyes at the highest levels of the people who make our decisions.
81	1. Those 3500 workers are employed for 20-30 years, which takes up half a work-life. Therefore, although they are temporary, that is jobs created until they are halfway to retirement. My opponent states solar plants, which is a good source of energy, but he has forgotten that this is a debate about whether or not other forms are good, but instead that nuclear power is good.  2. Nuclear waste is the biggest con in the nuclear energy. This is going to be readily solved in 2 ways: a. The space elevator is only 2-4 decades away (http://news.yahoo.com...) which reduces the half life of nuclear waste from 1000 years to 300 years. b. Fusion reactors are rapidly approaching which not only gets rid of nuclear waste, but also creates more power.  3. The cost of a nuclear power plant benefits the economy even more, and once again forgets the point of this argument.
82	I'm only 11 btw. And my sister is also against me. Well, Think about It, Which is worse: making waste and putting it in a hole (nuclear) or pumping lots of bad stuff into the air (coal)? Every single energy-making way has a bad side to it, And I'm not saying that nuclear power is perfect. I think we should use nuclear energy more till we have an eco-friendly way of making energy. There is a new material called thorium that becomes safe in only 100 years, And we as humans are looking into a way to reuse nuclear power, And by looking into: I mean we are building these generators. To solve the volcano problem we could put a waste facility in the middle of a tectonic plate. Even though there have been 7 explosions in the world, 3 of them have been contained and each explosive reaction has happened in a 30-year break. Scientist say that in 40 more years humans can produce energy in an eco-friendly way, So there will probably be only one more nuclear explosion, And witch tec expanding there might not even be a next explosive. For the 3 argument, You got me there. Even though the cost is on the rise, Tec has to improve and to improve we need more money. I know cost is going on the rise, But we probably won't keep using nuclear power for long. There one day will be an eco-friendly way of making electricity. Nuclear power is more efficient, 300 tonnes of Uranium equals 3500000 tonnes of coal. Also, Did you know that in 2013 NASA did research, And nuclear incident deaths are ranked dead last (including the nuclear explosions) for the most deaths. When we started using nuclear energy we so far have saved 240 gigatonnes of co2 from going into our air. Please, I would like to hear what else is bad about nuclear energy. (I'm doing a project about this topic).
83	Hello, This is my first debate and I would first like to say thank you for opening the thread. We should not expand our use of nuclear energy for four main reasons: Waste, Cost, Dependency, and accidents. The United Kingdom alone produces 200 million tons of radioactive waste each year, which is a problem. There are two main forms of waste storage available right now: Near surface storage and deep geological storage. Near surface storage is not efficient because it is short lived and can pose issues to living organisms that break down nitrogen in the soil and can furthermore affect us because the nitrogen that is broken down by the bacteria comes back to us in one way or another, via plants that we eat or animals that we eat. Deep geological storage seems like a good idea because we push the problem farther away from where we live on the surface, but we are not sure of the long term effects of this storage with the creation of new land masses coming from volcanic eruptions. Chernobyl has been the single worse nuclear ACCIDENT that has occurred in the world. If you are not educated on this event please go ahead and research it. Unfortunately we have not been able to complete thorough studies in Chernobyl since the accident, but there have been "sightings" of unusual creatures and mutated animals in the area. This is not a confirmed source. The point is until we have perfected the art of nuclear energy on a small scale, it should not be expanded upon in a larger scale. An unfortunate side effect of nuclear power is a dependency by developing countries. Many small countries depend on nuclear energy and this should not be expanded upon. The reason being is that these countries need to become independent enough to create their own energy in a clean manner (except the Republic of Singapore). With a growing dependency upon nuclear energy there will be a growing need, which is not good because our storage places are limited right now. The cost of nuclear energy is on the rise, from 2002 to 2009 the cost per plant has raised by five to seven billion dollars. This is the cost to begin the construction of a nuclear power plant and doesn't take into consideration the cost of fuel, maintenance and physical running cost, let alone real estate and storage cost. The average cost to create a solar farm can be afforded by your average upper middle-class American. This fact shows that there are cheaper forms of renewable energy that may not be as efficient, but are more reasonable for consumer and environment.
84	Renewable energy should be the preferred choice when considering energy sources for the future. Nuclear energy carries too much of a risk and comes with too many potential negative outcomes to be considered a viable option. The potential for devastating accidents, environmental catastrophes, and long-term health effects associated with nuclear power make it an unwise choice compared to renewable energy sources. Additionally, the costs associated with building and maintaining a nuclear plant can be exorbitant, making renewable energy a more cost-effective option.  With renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, there are no negative outcomes associated with energy production. These sources do not produce any pollutants or waste materials and can be installed almost anywhere. Furthermore, renewable energy sources are becoming increasingly cost-effective, allowing them to be competitive with other forms of energy in terms of production costs.  Nuclear power also cannot compete with renewable energy in terms of scalability. Nuclear power is limited by the fact that each reactor must be built at a specific site, meaning that only a limited amount of power can be generated. Renewable energy, on the other hand, is infinitely scalable and can be used to generate almost unlimited power.  Overall, it is clear that nuclear energy is not a viable option compared to renewable energy sources. Nuclear energy carries too much of a risk, both in terms of potential accidents and in the long-term environmental and health consequences of nuclear waste. Furthermore, nuclear power is not as cost-effective, scalable, or environmentally friendly as renewable energy sources. Renewable energy should be the preferred choice when considering energy sources for the future.
85	As already admitted, there are cons to nuclear, as there are cons to all sources. However, at least with nuclear we aren't destroying the atmosphere. Other countries seem to be handling things just fine with nuclear waste and disasters, so what does this opponent make of that?
86	In this round, my opponent misinterpreted and misrepresented my arguments yet again. He claims solar technology is unproven, despite the fact it has been proven for years. He claims recent developments in solar technology are unknown, despite the fact they have been proven several times. He claims that we need nuclear energy NOW, and that using alternative forms of energy should come later as they take too much time, despite nuclear reactors taking much longer to set up than solar power plants. He also brings up that nuclear waste is stored in the desert, so it can't reach our water supply, despite the fact most nuclear power plants are on the East coast, where no such desert to seclude the radioactive waste exists. In conclusion, with every point of my opponent's argument refuted, the United States should clearly NOT substantially increase nuclear energy. With your vote obliged to go to PRO, I thank you for reading and bid you good day.
87	First, I would like to apologize for forgetting to include a conclusion in my last round. In order to make up for this, I have provided a clear conclusion at the end of my argument to summarize my points.   Second, I must dispute the notion that nuclear energy can only create 20% of energy due to increasing demand. According to the World Nuclear Association, nuclear energy could account for 25-30% of the world's electricity by 2050, which would be an increase from its current 11% share. This indicates that nuclear energy has the potential to make up a significant portion of the energy pie in the future, despite the increasing demand for energy.  Third, I must dispute the idea that the cooling systems and waste management of nuclear energy are major problems. The cooling systems of nuclear reactors use water to help reduce the amount of radiation released into the environment, and the waste management systems of nuclear reactors are highly secure and designed to minimize radiation exposure. Moreover, the generation of nuclear waste is minimized through improved efficiency, and the waste can be safely stored for thousands of years.   Fourth, I must dispute the idea that the efficiency of nuclear energy is low. Nuclear energy produces relatively low carbon emissions and has a very high efficiency, with many reactors able to achieve a thermal efficiency of up to 35-40%. This means that more than three-quarters of the energy released is converted into electricity.   Finally, I must dispute the idea that the cleanliness of nuclear energy is incorrect. Nuclear energy produces no air pollution and very little waste, making it a clean form of energy. In fact, the nuclear waste created by nuclear energy can be used for beneficial purposes, such as the production of medical isotopes.  In conclusion, nuclear energy is a viable and efficient source of energy that should be included in the energy mix. It produces low carbon emissions, has a high efficiency, produces no air pollution, and can be used to create beneficial products. It is clear that nuclear energy can make an important contribution to the energy pie, and should not be discounted or ignored.
88	Sorry, I've been cruising around in the Caribbean for the past week. I thought I'd have internet, but I didn't. So this'll just have to become a 2-round debate. You're definitely right that coal and oil aren't going to serve us much longer. We're fast reaching the end of the earth's supply of oil. Soon we're going to have to find a different, renewable source of energy to keep us alive and driving our cars. But I don't think the predominant one will be wind energy. Ever notice that the only places that really utilize wind for electricity are small, rural villages? The reason is simple: wind energy just isn't efficient enough to power larger, urban centers. How many windmills do you think it would take to power a metropolis like New York? I'm not sure what will top out as the best new energy source when oil hits the can, but I think it will probably be nuclear, at least until we run out of fuel for that too. Nuclear reactions create a HUGE amount of power, and if we ever figure out how to make a sustained fusion reaction, we'll have an endless supply of very powerful fuel.   Wind energy is the best available energy because it will never run out. Neither will solar, hydro, geothermal, etc. All other energy's will either run out or are way to expensive to start up and keep running. Not really. It might not be too expensive to make a few hundred windmills for a rural village, but the costs of building and maintaining enough windmills to sustain the whole world (we're talking millions and millions) would be a lot. On the other hand, for example, it is very cheap to put a power plant in a dam or waterfall capable of powering a small city.   Some other energy's are bad for the environment and will make the world a worse place than it is and will be with using fossil fuels. I'm assuming you're referring chiefly to nuclear, which has seen a few unfortunate disasters. But nuclear energy is only dangerous when power plants are poorly maintained or some nutjob throws radioactive isotopes into the ocean. Today's federal regulations make another disaster like Three Mile Island extremely unlikely.   Also, some people are too busy with work and handling kids that they don't have time to try to make a difference in the world and change what energy sources we are using most frequently. Not me. I'm soon going into mechanical engineering, and am strongly considering heading into the field of alternate energy for a career. It really is a promising field. It's good to see that some other people are looking into this subject.
89	Who is this man "Trump"? There have been several articles posted on the internet lately that suggest that Donald Trump isn't who he is portraying himself to be, as a true conservative Republican. In a REDSTATE article, for instance, the author states, "The Bible says not to put new Christians in leadership positions. I don't think the conservative movement should put new conservatives in leadership positions either. Let them be sure what they believe first." In the same article, it is stated that Donald Trump has been a contributor to the Democrat party and organizations that conservatives were against, thus raising questions about who Donald Trump really is. Some have suggested that Donald Trump is a spoiler, taking away votes that could have gone to another Republican candidate running for president. Donald Trump covers himself by saying that he was a businessman and as such, he gave money to a lot of different causes and people, that was the way business was done. Is the reason that Donald Trump is gaining so much support because the conservatives and Republicans in general are becoming fed up with the way the "Good old boys"/"Establishment Republicans" and establishment Democrats have been doing business as usual in Washington? Maybe the answer is that conservative and independent voters are willing to take a chance on Donald Trump's promise to promote the things that conservatives and independent voters believe in. Betting on Donald Trump to be the conservative and independent's friend is a gamble, only time will tell whether the gamble paid off. We can only hope that Donald Trump actually believes in what he is saying and is not just mouthing the words that the conservatives and independents wanted to hear, but is actually promising to deliver on them. Only time will tell whether Donald Trump is the real deal or just a businessman saying the things that will get him elected.
90	Thank you for posting your debate. No need to worry, Donald Trump is a successful businessman, right? But what happens when he makes a mistake? I've done some research and found that Donald Trump has some unstable qualities. He declared himself god in his last debate. Also, what have Iraq and Syria done to us? WHY do we need to blow them off the face of the Earth? That could start a world war that would end very badly. It's our government's job, also, to help people looking for a better life coming to the states. In closing, we as a union should not vote for Donald Trump. It will end badly.
91	Donald Trump would be a bad candidate. He has no political experience, is racist and sexist, and doesn't explain things at all! He said he will replace Obamacare with "something terrific", like what? When he says terrific, it may mean horrible! He doesn't explain how it will be! China is one of the United States' major trade partners, and Donald Trump's stance on trading with China? "Listen you motherfucker, we're going to tax you 25 percent!" China is a very important country to the US, and China would be outraged if Donald Trump actually follows through. Here is another quote from Donald Trump. "I will build a great wall " and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me " and I"ll build them very inexpensively. I will build a great, great wall on our southern border, and I will make Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words." How will he make Mexico pay for that wall? Mexican President Vicente Fox said multiple times "he would not pay for that f---ing wall." Mexico is our third biggest trade partner, and over 2 million people's jobs are related to trade with Mexico. Trying to get Mexico to pay for the wall would put 2 million jobs at risk. Donald Trump doesn't really have a plan for that (or anything)! If you take a look at the Republicans' political experience, Donald Trump is one of the few who has none. Cruz, Rubio, and even most of the other long-shot candidates have some sort of political background. That's why Donald Trump would be an inexperienced and bad candidate. And, Donald Trump is both racist and sexist. He thinks all Mexicans are rapists, is a friend of the KKK, and called women fat, pigs, dogs, slobs, disgusting animals, and so on. In 2007, he compared women to architecture. He also called all women gold-diggers. He made many more sexist and insulting comments to women, and also many racist comments about Mexicans. There is a Donald Trump sexism tracker. Here is the link: http://www.telegraph.co.uk... This is proof that Donald Trump would be the worst president if he wins, worse than any other president in history.

93	I will start off with some definitions. Definitions Sith- ancient kratocratic organization wielding the dark side of the Force, typically using crimson lightsabers and attempting to achieve great power. Kratocratic- government by those who are strong enough to seize power through force or cunning.   Arguments Donald Trump wishes to achieve great power- One of the objectives of the Sith is to overthrow the weak, take its place, and rule with absolute unobstruction. Donald Trump, as everyone is aware of, is running for president of the United States- the highest position of power in the government. Donald Trump has taken many jabs at our current leadership, as well as other weaker candidates such as Lindsey Graham and Rick Perry. He is attempting to tear down the weaker candidates and take the position of ultimate power.   Donald Trump hates Mexicans- Donald Trump's criticism of Mexico and their immigrants have been the source of much controversy. Sith lords despise their enemy, the Jedi. The Jedi are wielders of the light side of the Force. They are peaceful and pacifist.   Donald Trump wears Sith garments and command a legion of soldiers- Donald Trump has been observed wearing traditional Sith cloaks, and has been seen commanding armies of Stormtroopers. This guarantees his connection with the Dark Side.   Sources https://i60.tinypic.com/ip9ik.jpg https://i62.tinypic.com/23495ry.jpg
94	Dear The Conservative Socialist,  Donald Trump is a racist and a liar, and he has demonstrated this on multiple occasions. He believes that blacks are lazy, which is a blatant generalization, and he has even gone as far as to say that "they" don't look like Indians to Indians - a phrase that is derogatory and denigrating. He also seems to be a big fan of white supremacists, which is even more alarming.   Voting for Donald Trump is a terrible idea, and unless you want to see this great nation turned into a fascist state, you must support me in standing against him.   Thank you,  Drago 31
95	qwzx has accepted this debate with knowledge that this results in automatic loss, as dictated by rule 6. However, he's trying to argue his case that I was not specific enough on what exactly you will lose. Any person with common sense would be able to know that I meant he would lose the debate by accepting. But fine. I will accept your implication, as I did not specify what exactly you would lose. However, I ALSO did not specify that I was talking about Donald J. Trump, an imaginary character made up by me who has very close similarities to Donald Trump, but is nonetheless NOT Donald Trump. I did not specify which Trump I meant, so my mistake. The only reason I didn't put in his middle name is that I thought there was a rule limiting how long one can specify a name. Now that the implications are cleared up, here's my argument: Donald J. Trump is not my president because he is an imaginary characters.
96	Although I do agree with your stance on Donald Trump's economic policies, he lacks the necessary empathy and compassion to be an effective President. Protests and the organization of the Women's March have already shown that Trump is unfit to lead the largest economic country in the world. Additionally, the President should serve as a role model for citizens, regardless of whether it is part of the job description or not. Trump may be a successful businessman, but he will never be a fair or true President. His policies may benefit the US economy in the short-term, but he fails to recognize the needs of the people he is supposed to represent.
97	Donald Trump is a liar who often tells lies unintentionally and finds it hard to stop. According to Politifact, 76% of his statements are rated "mostly false," "false," or "pants on fire," which is an unusually high rate of dishonesty. Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, is rated 29% false by the same source. She may be desperate, but her statements are still largely truthful.
98	If Donald Trump doesn't win the election, the Democrats won't have any work to do. They'll just be finding fault and not helping the people. I don't agree with his methods, but he's the only President who is actually telling the truth and speaking out against the issues. Sadly, no one is listening to him. If I were him, I would step down now and let the Democrats clean up the mess they've created. The virus has only been used to make the rich richer, and there is definitely such a thing as global warming. The Democrats and the rest of the world have put us in poverty, and yet no one is paying attention to someone who's trying to make a difference. Robert De Niro's comments make no sense - how can he be working on a movie about the virus when he doesn't even believe in it? Who's more evil?
