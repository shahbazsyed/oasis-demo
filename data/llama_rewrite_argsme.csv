0	Climate change clearly does not exist, here are reasons why: (1) Exhaling Carbon Dioxide is no clear threat to our climate, we just breathe it out, our cars do it too (2) It is a conspiracy (3) There are no sources to back your statement up Here are my sources on how "Climate Change" doesn't exist: (1) http://www.globalclimatescam.com... (2) http://www.newsmax.com... (3) https://en.wikipedia.org... These 3 sources tell you that climate change is fake, first one tells you the top 10 reasons why climate change does not exist, the second, facts about this "global warming" hoax; And finally, The third source tells you the entire conspiracy that "Climate Change exists".  The sources all agree that climate change is a hoax and not a reality. Therefore, it is fair to say that climate change does not exist.
1	R3 Arguments Anthropogenic climate change is a scientific consensus, and its effects on human lives and infrastructure have already been felt. Fossil fuel companies have actively funded organizations denying the reality of climate change and blocking policy changes to address it, risking a crisis that could come down hardest on the poor. Political efforts must be taken to hold these companies accountable, including fines and jail time for executives in cases of extreme negligence. Climate change is a real and present danger, and we must act now to reduce our carbon footprint and prevent further harm.

2	A scientific consensus exists on the reality of anthropogenic climate change. " But there is a scientific consensus on the reality of anthropogenic climate change. Climate scientists have repeatedly tried to make this clear. It is time for the rest of us to listen." [0] Man-made climate change has already claimed human lives and continues to do so. "in a general context where the anthropogenic contribution to climate change is becoming more plausible, led to an excess of 14,947 deaths in France, between August 4 and 18, 2003. The greatest increase in mortality was due to causes directly attributable to heat: dehydration, hyperthermia, heat stroke." [1] "The association between climate change and the frequency and intensity of extreme heat events is now well established. " [2] "The World Health Organisation estimates that the warming and precipitation trends due to anthropogenic climate change of the past 30 years already claim over 150,000 lives annually. Many prevalent human diseases are linked to climate fluctuations, from cardiovascular mortality and respiratory illnesses due to heatwaves, to altered transmission of infectious diseases and malnutrition from crop failures." [3] "The consensus that humans are causing recent global warming is shared by 90%–100% of publishing climate scientists according to six independent studies by co-authors of this paper. Those results are consistent with the 97% consensus reported by Cook et al " [4] My argument is succinct and should prove that man-made climate change is extremely likely to exist.

3	My position on climate change is that I not only believe in it, but I believe it is primarily caused by humans. I will start my opening argument by stating that global warming is a proven fact and anyone that disagrees with me is misinformed on this subject. According to sources, 97% of scientists believe that climate change is human-caused. Additionally, the arguments put forth by human-caused climate change deniers are not fact-driven and I wish my opponent the best of luck. Sources: Shaftel, H. (Ed.). (2012, January 5). Global Climate Change: Consensus. Retrieved February 3, 2015, from http://climate.nasa.gov...
4	There is an overwhelming scientific consensus that climate change presents a serious risk to the future of the Earth and to humanity. Many of the threats we face due to climate change are insidious, and while some deniers may not recognize them, they are real and serious. Among these are the spread of potentially lethal diseases such as that caused by the Zika virus. Other diseases formerly confined to the tropics will spread across North America and Europe. Furthermore, climate change is being caused by human activity. There are a limited number of circumstances under which free speech can be restricted. One of them is child pornography. The reason that can be banned is that the harm caused to children in the production of child porn is of such magnitude that the normal means of combating bad speech -- more speech -- is not adequate or sufficient. The ignorance peddled by climate change deniers, many of whom do so for greed, is no different than peddling child pornography. Just as with child pornographers, those threatened most by the adverse effects of climate change are children, who will include teenagers sent to fight the increasing number of wars and conflicts which will likely occur. Yes, the risk is too high to allow this ignorance to continue to be peddled. Should we jail people who write and utter falsehoods about climate change? If need be, yes.
5	Pro argued that CO2 was the driving force of climate change, and that this was supported by the IPCC report and the consensus of climate scientists. I argued that the IPCC report was not representative of a consensus of climate scientists, and the oil industry was not responsible for the research funding that opposed the theory. Pro argued that Venus proved that even a small amount of CO2 could have a significant impact on climate, but I argued that Venus's atmosphere was much denser than Earth's, and that the water cycle, not CO2, was the dominant factor in Earth's climate. I also provided several scientific references that supported my argument.
6	I appreciate the opportunity to respond to the above argument. The argument is filled with errors and misrepresentations of the facts. Firstly, it is incorrect to state that the professional societies “operate in much the same fashion” as the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). In reality, the scientific societies mainly focus on peer-reviewed publications and membership to make their consensus. The IPCC, on the other hand, is made up of many scientists from different scientific societies who have gone through a rig
7	I shall rebut the counterargument in the following order: 1. The original argument provided evidence that CO2 emissions are increasing, which is attributed to human activity. The counterargument stated that increased levels of CO2 emissions are not necessarily a result of human activity, but can also be due to natural processes. This response ignores the fact that the original argument acknowledged the possibility of increased levels of CO2 due to natural processes, but then went on to explain how human activity is a probable cause of the rise in CO2 levels.  2. The counterargument claims that 3.225% of all CO2 emissions are caused by humans, but fails to provide any evidence to back up this claim. This claim is refuted by the original argument which provided evidence from the article "Estimating the Role of Humans in Increasing Atmospheric CO2" which states that humans are responsible for 3.225% of the total increase in atmospheric CO2 since 1750. 3. The counterargument claims that the global temperature has only risen by 1 degree Fahrenheit since 1880, but fails to provide any evidence to back up this claim. This claim is refuted by the original argument which provided evidence from the IPCC report which states that the global temperature has risen by an average of 0.13 degrees Celsius per decade since 1880.  4. The counterargument claims that since humans have had an impact on the climate, it is hardly anything to be worried about at all. This claim is refuted by the original argument which provided evidence that human-induced climate change is real and can have wide-ranging and long-lasting impacts on the environment, ecosystems and human societies. 5. The counterargument claims that there is a problem with anthropogenic climate change not actually happening, however, fails to provide any evidence to
8	I accept this challenge. First, I should ask to be clear: When you say "climate change is a fraud," are you referring specifically to anthropogenic climate change or all climate change? If it is the former, as I suspect it is, I won't waste time explaining all the evidence that the globe is, in fact, warming at an unprecedented rate and instead go straight into attribution. If, however, you don't think the globe is really warming at an unprecedented rate, I'm happy to go into the evidence for it. Moreover, "fraud" implies more than just the majority of scientists being wrong (i.e., misinterpreting the evidence) but also that they are intentionally lying. This is a big claim given the number of scientists who support the concept of anthropogenic climate change and one that incurs its own burden of proof. See you some time within the next 72 hours.
9	Round four defense "The first most obvious mistake my opponent made in their argument was a cherry-picking fallacy. A cherry-picking fallacy is defined as "When only select evidence is presented in order to persuade the audience to accept a position, and evidence that would go against the position is withheld. The stronger the withheld evidence, the more fallacious the argument." [8] As you can see, my opponent, in round 2, only offered evidence which suggests anthropogenic climate change is real, and did not offer any evidence that suggests climate change is due to some other reason. " Capitalistslave First, there would have to be counter evidence to withhold. I do not perceive that I withheld any evidence, any my opponent has not shown any counter evidence. My opponent has failed to meet his/her burden of proof by showing that there is evidence to withhold. Second, if any evidence is withheld it is weak, thus the fallacious of the argument is small. Third, there is the fallacy fallacy. "Form: Argument A for the conclusion C is fallacious. Therefore, C is false. Exposition: Like anything else, the
10	Greetings! Thank you for this debate, this should be fun! In accepting this debate I do not pretend to stand for all of feminism seeing as there are many different sects of the movement. I also do not claim to know everything about feminism. I will use sources from the internet as well as books to support my argument. First, we must define Feminism. There are many different types of feminism. For example: Antiporn feminism, Cultural Feminism, Hip Hop feminism, Lesbian Feminism, Queer feminism, and Radical feminism. The feminism it seems you disagree with is the one that is prevalent in the Pink Hat movement. But my stance will be from the Antiporn and Cultural Feminist movements. These movements advocate the reality: Women are more nurturing, cooperative, and communicative. Instead of measuring themselves against men, women should make their own activities more visible and valued. This includes protests and activities like the Pink Hat March, which call attention to gender inequalities and women's rights. Want to do away with the dehumanization of women in pornography and sex work? Yes! This is exactly what Antiporn Feminism is fighting for! There is no "going too far" with advocating for human rights. In conclusion, I believe my stance in this debate is best supported by Antiporn and Cultural Feminism, which aim to empower women and eradicate gender inequality. Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing your response.
11	Feminism has no gender. I am a man and I am a feminist. Feminism by definition stands up for all my perspectives, ambitions, desires and behaviours. Feminism is the act of advocating (though perhaps passively in some circumstances) against woman abuse, and everything which leads to women being slandered – including false propaganda of feminism by sluts who enable womanizers and glorify perverts such as homosexuality. {It is not an act of feminism to defend a slut who enabled an adulterous man. That would be counterproductive.} I am pro-feminism, that is why I accepted this debate. And feminism has no negative attributes, nor does it have a gender.
12	Con has argued that dictionaries do not authoritatively define words, but has given no proof of this. Con's presented only one argument in this entire debate - that masculinism is male supremacy and feminism is female supremacy - without giving any evidence to back the claim that words with similar roots cannot have different meanings. Furthermore, Con didn't provide any source of definition for masculinism, so Con's argument is not sound.   I have offered six authoritative sources stating that feminism is the movement for equality between men and women. I am for equality between men and women. I am for feminism. According to Con, Con is an "equalist" and is "for the rights of men and women". Therefore, Con is also for feminism. The statement of debate is "Feminism". I have proven I am pro. I have proven Con is not Con.
13	You claim that feminism encourages false rape accusations and stereotyping men as bad. Um... No, that's not what feminism is at all. Feminism is the doctrine advocating social, political, and all other rights of women equal to those of men[1]". Now, you admit that this is something you are for, so I guess you have problems with how feminists go about this? Really, I think your entire argument stems from a complete misunderstanding of the movement. So, what is feminism? This is a difficult question because, much like religion, feminism is different for each feminist. The mission statement of the movement is equal rights between the sexes, which you agree is good. By this definition, you are a feminist. If you could indicate how you aren't a feminist, that'd be appreciated. Maybe you disagree that there is a systematic discrimination against women, the patriarchy. Is there a patriarchy? Well, as it commonly seems to be the case, I must define "the patriarchy". Basically, it means a system where men are valued over women[2]. This can be shown in the wage gap[3], rape culture[4] (though men can be victims of rape, rape culture usually targets women), and gender roles[5]. Rebuttals: What you are saying here is very dangerous. Stating that feminism promotes false rape accusations is an example of rape culture. 60% of victims report abuse, and 97% of abusers will not see jail[6]. Only 1.5-8% of rape reports are fake[7], so Puh-LEASE do not try and say that considerable amount of rape reports are fake and that we should cast doubt on those few that come forward. If we are going of the definition of feminism I stated earlier, then feminists aren't trying to put men as stereotypically bad. We are trying to make men and women equal. If you think that trying to remove the bias towards men is trying to say they are bad, then I am going to have to ask you go to timeout because that idea is downright childish. In the end there you say something about "calling the police about something ridiculous is obscure". I think you mean absurd, but if you didn't then I'm not sure what that would mean. If it is obscure, then false rape accusations don't happen often and thus shouldn't be a problem. If you meant absurd, then I would agree that false rape accusations are deplorable, but again I would say that "false rape reports" is not a tenant of feminism nor is it a likely to occur.
14	Feminism is a movement that works to promote the rights, well-being, and equality of women. It is a movement that strives to end gender inequality and has made significant progress in many countries. Despite this, gender inequality still exists in many parts of the world, including the United States. In such places, feminism remains an important movement that continues to fight for the rights of women. In the United States, feminism has come a long way, leading to greater rights and opportunities for women, such as the right to vote, the right to work, and the right to education. Even with this progress, feminism is still necessary to achieve true equality. Women in the United States still face gender-based discrimination in the workplace, and feminism continues to fight for equal pay and an end to sexual harassment and other forms of discrimination. With feminism still being necessary to achieve true equality, it is clear that the movement will not go away any time soon.
15	I agree with you that feminism is needed in countries where women are oppressed and have little rights, but you must consider the conditions of the countries economy and social interaction as feminism could cause mass revolts that would massacre women and could cause a rebellion against these weak 3rd world countries. Before feminism even comes to these countries, slow progressive changes must be made to deal with each conflict differently. You are very correct that feminism is no longer needed in 1st world countries like the US, but first democracy and peace must reach these areas. Much of these middle eastern countries make these laws due to Islamic influence, as Muslims believe that a woman must cover herself and listen to her husband. What these countries misinterpreted is how Islam doesn’t state that husbands have complete control over their wives. Maybe a large religious event where a powerful person gives a touching speech talking about the word of Allah and how his true vision of an Islamic society would be that warms the hearts of Islamic country leaders and somehow influences them to establish laws that establish if not democratic rights or laws, feminism in the country.
16	Thank you for the response, especially since you had a bad internet connection. Let me refute your points. First off, I reject your definition of feminism. I think feminism was the belief that men and women should be equal, but I proved that this is no longer the case in third wave feminism. I also reject your premise, because I stated in my first argument that MODERN feminism is harmful. My opponent has implied that it is the fault of men today that women weren't allowed to vote in some states until 1919. It was wrong that this happened, but taking revenge on men won't solve anything. In fact, it will cause embitterment between both sexes. Your first argument is invalid, because I never said that men and women weren't intellectually equal (although they generally don't have as much physical strength as men do, which I will provide the proof for below). And again, you can't blame the phrasing of the Declaration of Independence on men born two centuries after it was created. I don't think you have won this debate. Maybe I am wrong though. Maybe you can prove yourself in the second round. Good luck https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov... (source for men's vs. women's strength).
17	Hi everyone, I'm Ilan and I'm not a feminist - but I believe in equality.  Immediately, some may be alarmed that I'm not a feminist - a word that has become synonymous with gender equality. However, I want to make it clear that I'm not a sexist or a rape apologist; I firmly believe that in the idea that everyone should be equal, no ifs or buts.   So why am I not a feminist? The answer is that feminism does not have a monopoly on equality; if you believe in equality, you are not automatically a feminist as many feminists like to state. I am an egalitarian. Egalitarianism is the belief that everyone should be treated equally and should receive equal rights and opportunities. The difference between feminism and egalitarianism is that feminism is primarily focused on achieving equality for women, while egalitarianism is focused on achieving equality for all.   Feminists often criticize men for not speaking up for their issues and for staying silent on issues like sexual assault and workplace inequality. I want to make it clear that men are just as capable of advocating for themselves and raising their own issues - I am a man, and I am fighting for my rights. As a man, I feel that I should campaign for my own rights and those of other men, just as feminists should campaign for women's rights.   I also want to address some of the more common counterarguments against men's rights: prostate cancer isn't a feminist issue? Yes, but it is an issue, and it should be addressed. Men and other groups are included in feminist issues, but even feminists still do not prioritize men's issues. And yes, men's rights activists should be the ones to campaign for men's problems - but if it really is for everyone, why don't feminists focus on male issues?   In conclusion, I believe in equality for all people - not just women - and I will continue to advocate for it.
18	First to answer the attack on Observation One: Pro's response to this was that we are not in Iraq. This piece of evidence was from 2010, and since then nothing has changed as we still have people supporting feminism. During the Iraq war, it was true that they were more likely to be raped than shot. If we were in Iraq today it would still stand. Next he said he was never talking about pornography, however it can be inferred from his opener. Now the big argument he made in this last round was that all my arguments were about equal rights, not feminism. However, this argument is flawed. A quick google search indicates the definition of feminism is "the advocacy of women's rights on the grounds of political, social, and economic equality to men." This means that feminism, by its very definition means equal rights to women. Pro admitted they are pro equal rights, so therefore, by the very definition of feminism, they are pro feminism. Additionally, note Observation 2 and Advantages 1 and 2 were untouched in the last round, which is reason alone to vote for con. In conclusion, by the definition of feminism, pro conceded that feminism is good, as well as not denying that feminism is bad by not attacking my advantages of feminism.
19	First off, I did some searching, and the Merriam-Webster dictionary is made in liberal Massachusetts. They clearly bent the definition to serve their needs. I don't agree with that definition. You see, if a said they were a "masculinist", people would say that I'm a male supremacist, but if I called myself a feminist, I would be called a "champion of rights". So, since "masculinism" is male supremacy, then feminism is female supremacy. I consider myself an "equalist". Feminism today is so twisted and hypocritical today, that it is best to abandon it. I am for the rights of men and women, not just women, and not only men.
20	"The greatest destroyer of peace is abortion because if a mother can kill her own child, what is left for me to kill you and you to kill me? There is nothing between," says Mother Teresa. Abortion, what does this really mean? The definition of abortion is the deliberate termination of a human pregnancy, most often performed during the first 28 weeks. About 42 million women in the entire world with unintended pregnancies choose abortion. Abortion is a big controversial topic, people believe abortion should be illegal and others think it should stay legal. Why would someone want to kill an innocent little life? It"s not their fault people made mistakes and now they"re the ones having to pay for it. Abortion should be illegal because abortions are not safe, laws are protecting unborn babies, and fetuses can feel pain. Abortion should have never been legal.  Furthermore, laws are put in place to protect unborn babies and make sure they are given the rights that they deserve. Abortion is not safe and can cause long-term physical and psychological effects for the woman. Fetuses can also feel pain and could suffer during the abortion process. Thus, abortion should remain illegal.
21	I appreciate my opponent's argument against abortion. However, I would like to point out that the resolution is not "abortion" in general, but specific forms of abortion. My argument is that the risks associated with dangerous abortions should not outweigh a woman's right to choose.
22	-ABORTION- Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by the removal or expulsion from the uterus of a fetus or embryo, resulting in or caused by its death.[1] An abortion can occur spontaneously due to complications during pregnancy or can be induced, in humans and other species. In the context of human pregnancies, an abortion induced to preserve the health of the gravid (pregnant female) is termed a therapeutic abortion, while an abortion induced for any other reason is termed an elective abortion. The term abortion most commonly refers to the induced abortion of a human pregnancy, while spontaneous abortions are usually termed miscarriages. I have a question for you: do you believe in torturing terrorists? (if the answer is no) If you said no, you are a moron because you believe in killing God’s perfectly harmless creations for nothing and not killing a terrorist for terrorizing our country. Do you believe in the death sentence? If you said no, your killing a baby for Nothing. Yes, you are killing it; you stop its heart from beating and deprive it of oxygen. What do you think God and Jesus our Lord and Savior think about that? If you are an atheist, please Google John 3:16.

25	If abortion were made illegal, the population would grow exponentially, resulting in forced abortions for women and subsequently rising suicide rates for women. This is because, in China, where abortion is legal, the government mandates that abortion be performed to control population growth. Thus, due to the high population density, many women are forcibly aborted, causing depression and suicidal thoughts. Furthermore, since men are less likely to be forcibly aborted, they have a lower rate of suicide compared to women. This reinforces the point that, if abortion were made illegal, the suicide rate among women would skyrocket. It is clear that, by keeping abortion legal, we can ensure that population growth does not become an issue.
26	You have made some minimal changes to your original argument while largely retaining the same structure and language. However, the argument still contains some errors, such as claiming that fetuses are not biologically proven to be humans, when in fact they are humans from the moment of conception. Additionally, you have not adequately addressed all of your opponent's arguments, such as their point about the safety of abortion procedures and the fact that abortion gives parents the option to decide whether or not to have a child.
27	I thank my opponent for his response to my previous statement. "Whether or not abortion can also be classified as assault is irrelevant to this debate" (I argue this statement) As a matter of fact it is relevant to this debate. The topic we are discussing is abortion and whether it should be accepted or not. Clearly anyone who is kicked in the stomach has witnessed an act of assault. Abortion is only abortion if it is considered to be or not to be by the child carrier. If not considered abortion, it is only a mere act of assault. This can happen to anyone. I now argue my opponent's ideology of the "morning after pill". Referring back to my opponent's definition of abortion, the morning after pill is also another form of abortion. It all eliminates the infant correct? Therefore, my opponent provided another form of abortion that he stated is the solution to pregnancy even though he is supposed to argue against it. Any act of the mother eliminating her child would be classified as abortion only if it is intended by the carrier. Immorality: No, I was not intending it to fall under my opponent's four categories. I was only preventing that from being argued. It may not be relevant to the four types of abortion, but it is relevant to the topic at hand. what is right and wrong?: The people in this world have their own basic concept of what is right or wrong. This can also relate to morality. Every single person shares the same individual mindset, their own gathered ideas and opinions of what is right and wrong. I extend my argument referring to morality with only the slightest question...What is moral in this world? Certainly not shaving. This refers to the Bible. It is absolutely hypocritical for someone who shaves to say abortion is immoral. In addition to my opponent's remark about whether kicking a woman in the stomach is moral or not. Assault is not moral. But then again we are not talking about assault, we are talking about abortion. Why I did not respond to the other three categories of abortion, well that is the thing....I actually did in a general remark. Referring to my previous statements about morality, intentional abortion and teen pregnancy. I extend my previous arguments..... In conclusion, I affirm abortion as a way of preventing further difficulty in life with both the mother and child. Creating problems or preventing them with out the slightest sense of guilt. Thank you!
28	The fact that laws do not reduce abortion. A comprehensive sex education, Readily available access to free birth control and a free and comprehensive support and health care system. America offers little and always at a cost, Punishing the poorest and the weakest shunning and shaming single teens mothers, Charging 30k for deliveries. It"s ironic that abortion laws are designed to limit abortions, Yet one of the best ways to reduce abortion is to liberalize or repeal anti-abortion laws. That"s not the only factor of course. The real key is to promote women"s rights, With particular attention to their reproductive rights. Most abortions occur because people can"t afford to have a child, So governments can significantly reduce abortion numbers by building a more stable, Prosperous society and making child-rearing economically feasible. There is no need for societies to defend fetal interests directly, As the best way to protect fetuses is to provide resources directly to pregnant people. When a pregnant woman is safe and healthy, So is her fetus. The abortion debate will probably never be resolved on a philosophical level, Because the anti-choice movement is strongly motivated by religious ideology. Their fixation on the fetus, With their foregone conclusion that fetuses are full human beings with rights, Cancels out any competing claim for women"s rights. Underlying all the pro-fetus rhetoric is the unquestioned assumption that women were made to have babies, This is their God-given natural role, And the law must enforce that. A logical extension of this view is that any woman who has an abortion must be a victim of coercion, Or too ignorant or desperate to understand what she"s doing. Since abortion is assumed to be bad for women, They must be "protected" from abortion by criminalizing it.
29	Rather than discussing the positives vs the negatives of abortion, pro has simply claimed that "abortion" "frees" people into having the right to pay for their own abortions. Would pro be fine then if the woman had to pay for her own abortion? If so, then I don't see the problem; pro would therefore agree that abortion is okay if the woman pays for it. Pro's entire argument, however, about being "free" would not apply to the con side, not his side. In other words, pro is arguing my side for me. If we became anti-abortion, then we'd all have to pay for unwanted babies that mother's were forced to have. This averages around 250k PER kid. http://www.huffingtonpost.com... Not only that, but this is simply the cost of raising a kid until he or she is 18. What if they can't find a job? Due to technology, we are moving AWAY from jobs, not towards jobs. We are already overpopulated as is; imagine what FORCING mother's to have kids they don't want would do to us. Talk about enslavement! We already have 100k orphans who are not adopted, and that's WITH allowing abortion. If we didn't allow abortion, that number could easily approach 1 million. https://showhope.org...
30	Thank you Pro for this interesting topic. "I think Trump is not life. Agree?" Before starting my own arguments let's define a few terms. Trump - a card of a suit any of whose cards will win over a card that is not of this suit "called also trump card. [1] Life - the ability to grow, change, etc., that separates plants and animals from things like water or rocks [2] Now there are 7 qualifications in order for something to have life. They are as follows: It should maintain some balanced conditions in its inner structure Its structure is highly organized. It should be able to break down or build up nutrients to release or store energy based on need. This is called Metabolism It should grow, which means its structure changes as time goes by in an advantageous manner. It should be able to respond to environmental stimuli on demand (as opposed to adaptation, which occurs over time). It should be able to reproduce itself. [3] Now as far as I can tell a "trump" or "trump card" doesn't meet any of these requirements making my opponents statement "trump is life" false. [1] http://www.merriam-webster.com...

Here comes Donald Trump, who started his campaign by ranting about how Mexican immigrants are rapists and drug dealers (...) After a Black Lives Matter protester was punched and kicked at a Trump rally, Trump said "Maybe he should have been roughed up." And he retweeted a graphic with fake statistics about black people supposedly murdering whites, which turns out to have been created by a neo-Nazi. (...) The thing that Trump is trying to communicate with this story is: racism is wrong. Source 2: (https://itstopswithme.humanrights.gov.au...) Racism has a significant impact both on the individuals who experience it and the wider community. Research shows that there are significant links between experiences of racism and discrimination and poor physical and mental health, reduced productivity and reduced life expectancy. Further, it is well-recognised that racism presents barriers to social and economic participation which can in turn cause social exclusion and entrench disadvantage, sometimes for generations. (...) It harbours mistrust. It incites hatred. It stops the word 'community' in its tracks. Trump's rhetoric is dangerous and will destroy the US. It destroys communities, causes crime, etc. Why would you ever support Trump?
32	Here is the source I will be using: - https://www.whitehouse.gov This website lists 13 reasons why Trump will make a great president. I am only going to copy and comment on two of them. 12. "Trump is planning to build a great, great wall (yes"two "greats") on our southern border between the U.S. and Mexico. The best part? He"s planning to have Mexico pay for that wall, and mark his words, "" I will immediately terminate President Obama"s illegal executive order on immigration."" 13. "Trump has also proposed a sweeping plan to defeat ISIS and protect our nation. He will crush ISIS, reform our immigration system to serve the interests of Americans, and honor our religious heritage. By building a wall, fighting ISIS, and strengthening the Christian religion, Trump will make the greatest president of all time. That is my argument. Thankyou
33	First of all, why do you think Mr. Trump will be such a "great" president? Trump is an inconsiderate jerk who thinks that he can say all the crap he likes to say about people and get away with it. He also talks about reducing our debt. Ask him how he can do that when he wants to build a wall around Mexico, which will: 1. Put us billions of dollars into more debt. 2. Make it ok to let him do with whatever he would like without trying to actually TALK to the Mexicans and ask them to stop illegally immigrating into our country.
34	First of all, I support O'Malley, but that isn't important. It looks like this debate comes down to Trump's stance on immigration. I showed clear harms from racism - shattered communities, (look at Ferguson if you want proof lol) poor mental and physical health, economic downturns, etc. If Trump becomes president and embraces racism, all these impacts will go nationwide. My opponent has no response to this, so insofar as I can prove Trump is racist, you vote neg. And I showed clear evidence of that, but if you want more, here's how illegal immigrants are treated. Source 3: (http://revcom.us...) These Minutemen inspired by rightwing Republican Pat Buchanan's claim that urgent action is needed to preserve the U.S. as an ethnically white, Christian-European nation. (...) The cold-blooded vigilante attacks on immigrants aren't a new development. Ranchers in Arizona have killed undocumented immigrants for years. They have terrorized them, hunted them down with dogs, and handed them over to the Border Patrol at gunpoint. (...) they have developed deep ties with powerful forces high in the government"and are operating in the era where any paranoid appeal for more security quickly gets official backing and a public hearing. (...) Mile by mile, walls and barbed wire have cut off Mexico from the United States, forcing more and more immigrants to cross over in the dangerous desolate stretches of border in Arizona. It has created an intense conflict zone, as desperate immigrant workers try to cross and survive, and an intensified government crackdown hunts them through the dry hills to trap them, capture them, (...) this reactionary Minuteman movement has emerged to demand even more extreme and violent actions against the immigrants. They have criticized the proposals made by President Bush and Mexico's President Vicente Fox to create a legal program for bringing Mexican immigrants into the U.S. So these Minutemen kill and hunt down not only illegal immigrants, but also innocent Americans. Clearly more anti immigration laws will simply fuel more racism, and the death of innocent people. So since Trump will cause more terrible organizations like this to form, please vote neg - vote down Trump.

36	I'll be honest, that was an interesting video, however, I still like him. Here's what I got from the video: 1. He's changed his opinion on multiple issues. I don't see anything wrong with that, if anything, I think he was smart to become a Republican in recent years. Look, times change meaning that a policy that would have worked years ago might not work today and a party that may have appeared favorable once may not appear as favorable now. In 2000, when Trump ran for president under the Reform Party, he believed in universal healthcare as an option. The idea that he maintains that belief, despite what the video said, is ridiculous. In early 2015, he brought up the idea that the government should start making deals with hospitals to help low income Americans. Later, a spokesperson (not Trump himself) stated that Trump would be open to a universal / market-based system that would open up a variety of choices. Today, his official healthcare plan affirms that he supports a 100% free market system, where insurance companies must compete nationwide - the exact opposite of universal healthcare. 2. He's donated to and supported the Bill and Hillary in the past. That makes Trump living proof that we have corrupt politicians in Washington; in fact, that's what brought down primary rivals like Sen. Rand Paul (who accepted money from Trump). The video starts going into conspiracy theory-mode; it theorizes that because Trump donated to them, he secretly supports them and is part of an elaborate plot to make Hillary our next president. First of all, there's no evidence. Second of all, if donating money means working for someone, wouldn't Trump also be working for Rand Paul? And wouldn't he have refrained from calling out Hillary for accepting his donation? 3. He's not extremely religious. I'm okay with that. He said that he does not ask God for forgiveness, and then the video pulls up Bible quote after Bible quote - but who really follows every word of the Bible? If you did, you'd be a criminal; the Bible says that we should stone our children if they are disobedient - which is considered murder, and murder is a crime. The video is basically anti-Trump propaganda with little to no factual information. SOURCES: https://www.donaldjtrump.com... https://www.donaldjtrump.com... GOP DEBATE: "I've given you money, too." -Trump to Sen. Rand Paul
37	Thank you for your well-researched and detailed argument regarding the many ways in which President Trump has been deemed racist. I will, however, address only the points that require a response. First, the incident in 1992, in which Trump paid a settlement to the parents of a 13-year-old girl who accused him of sexual misconduct, is unrelated to the racial issues at hand. Second, the reversal of an interpretation of the Civil Rights Act does not necessarily make the environment any less safe. It is unclear how this reversal affects the safety of the LGBTQ+ community. Third, the repeal of the ban on plastic bottles at national parks is not necessarily detrimental to the environment as plastic is still widely recycled. Finally, while the repeal of the lead bullet ban may have been detrimental to wildlife, there is no evidence that President Trump had any malicious intent.
38	No one will be tougher on ISIS than Donald Trump. Mostly because Islamic terrorism is eating up large portions of the Middle East and they have become wealthy. They have even built a hotel, making them a direct competitor of Trump Hotel. Trump is undeniably a great negotiator, and despite his outrageous public statements in the recent past, he knows how to navigate complex deals and convince a wide variety of industries, businesses, and investors to do what he wants and to work with him to achieve his goals. Trump isn"t politically correct. He isn"t afraid to say what he thinks, and he can certainly voice an opinion. If he has an issue with you, he will say it to your face. It"d be nice to have a politician in office with that level of transparency.
39	Trump has only caused chaos for this country and hasn't made a significant impact that was good. His campaigns in 2016 claimed that, "He would make America great again" Our citizens trusted his statement but he lied and took advantage of our trust. Many Americans had made the mistake of voting for him and many have vowed to not vote for him again. I believe Biden has the upper hand in this election, I believe if Biden wins, He will make this country better than Trump claimed he would. Biden has claimed he would help fix climate change, Which has been an ongoing, Environment threatening problem. That Trump has done NOTHING about. Global warming is one of the biggest threats to not just our country, BUT THE WHOLE WORLD. Yet, Our president could care less. Also, When Trump was elected, He had very little political history which should've been a sign that he knew nothing about government. It's almost like citizens voted blindly. Many accusations had been made that Trump was bribing people to vote for him. To be completely and utterly honest, I completely believe that Trump would make such an irrational decision like that. He's ignorant. He is also racist. Back in 2018 I believe, He made many racist comments about Hispanics and yes he did receive extreme backlash but that should be a CLEAR sign to people from everywhere in America that he doesn't deserve the title of "president" Now people who have worked hard in their political career, Like Biden, Were just tossed aside as if they hadn't worked hard. Trump grew up and built his career with daddy's money. He didn't work a single day for what he has now, Everything was basically handed to him. He has earned the right to take "The worst president" title from James Buchanan. He is the worst president out of the 45 presidents before him. Now that's a record to beat. It's pathetic that his impeachment didn't pass through. That decision would've saved this country a lot of havoc. He has recently ordered police to harm peaceful protesters, For George Floyd's death. Trump's lazy and poor decisions is the reason of Floyd's death. Many events have happened like Floyd's death in the past four years and Trump has done nothing about it. He instead sat there in the white house hiding. Recently, He had many peaceful protesters gathered in front of the white house tear gassed so he do a photo op. He uses his power for selfish needs, He is a selfish man. He made very misogynistic claims in the past, Which still wasn't enough for everyone to see how much of a bad man he was. He is an embarrassment to this country, He is an embarrassment to our presidency. No wonder other countries look down upon us. Receipts have been released of Trump working with Jeffery Epstein to human traffic. So not only is he misogynistic and racist. He's also a rapist. If anyone wants to go through what Trump has put us through in these past four years for another four years, Please think about the facts and the evidence. Biden has proven to be a better political and social figure than Trump.
40	When you simply dismiss an opponent's arguments as "factoids and other junk," it is to be assumed that you have no rebuttal for them. Thus, unless you provide an adequate rebuttal in later rounds, you concede all of these points as true. I don't know what political correctness has to do with this debate; if you would be so kind as to explain so both of us have some context to argue off of, that would be nice. Brexit has been a very controversial topic in recent years, and opinions on both sides have been very heated. I strongly believe that the effects of Brexit will be mostly negative, due to the uncertain economic and trade effects, as well as the destabilization of the European Union. Additionally, Britain has voted to invoke Article 50, meaning that the process of leaving the European Union has officially begun. I respect the will of the British people, but I do not believe that the choice they made is in their best interests. Britain has been a member of the European Union for over 40 years, and I do not believe that the social, economic, and political effects of leaving can be reversed. Therefore, I urge you to reconsider your position. If I'm not mistaken, however, you titled this debate "Brexit" and I took the Con position. Does this not mean that I am arguing that the effects of Brexit will be mostly negative and you arguing that they will be positive? Seeing as you don't appear to have made any actual arguments as to why a Brexit will be beneficial, I shall refrain from expanding my arguments this round, seeing as I have nothing to respond to.
41	Anti-Brexit had the facts, Brexit had the rhetoric. Irrational fear of immigration and losing autonomy. Britain clearly needs migrants considering it's own workers don't want to work the dirty jobs such as farming so migrants need to do it for them.  [1] Let's Look at the facts. Britain's Membership in the EU costs around 6.3 Billion pounds or 0.3% of britains GDP. So for the leave side to be economically superior leaving would not be able to affect the UK by more than 0.3%. But considering the UK makes 13% of it's GDP from selling commodties to the EU this seems unlikely. [2] The problem with this is that economists predict that the UK could lose up to 6% of It's GDP from leaving the EU which is much greater than 0.3% [3] This isn't even including additional costs for tarrifs that would amount to close to the cost for eu membership after free trade deals are abolished along with eu membership. [4] Also, Britain has complete control of their immigration policy so leaving would do almost nothing when it comes to immigration policy. Not to mention that 70% of Britain's population increase came from immigration. Limiting immigration radically could have some pernicious effects. [5] Clearly from this information, Brexit would have accomplished nothing in immigration and would hurt the UK economy in the long run. Your emotional appeal will not get you far.

42	Brexit will be beneficial for England as it will allow them to regain control of their borders and restrict immigration from certain parts of the world. Additionally, it will save them a considerable amount of money that would otherwise be spent on EU membership fees. Switzerland and Norway are both examples of countries outside of the EU which have managed to successfully maintain their own identity and sovereignty. Closing their borders to migration and controlling illegal immigration is completely feasible and has already been implemented by other countries. By leaving the EU, England will be able to do so without having to comply with the EU's rules and regulations. Borders are essential for the integration of nations and the ability to control immigration. It is a logical conclusion that Brexit will prove beneficial for England in the long run.
43	I accept your revised argument and will respond to it.  You said that “It is reasonable to conclude that the passing of Brexit will likely lead to a literal dividing of the UK, which would undoubtedly be a mistake for the UK”. You did not back up your argument. I’d like to know why the division would be a mistake for the UK, which you did not expound on.  The UK has historically benefitted from its membership in the European Union. It has access to the Single Market and the freedom of movement of people and goods. It has been able to participate in the cooperation on security, foreign policy and other areas. By leaving the European Union, the UK will no longer have access to these benefits and may be subject to new tariffs and other barriers to trade. This could lead to an economic downturn, as you mentioned in your original argument. It could also lead to a weakening of the UK’s standing in the world, as other countries will no longer have to take the UK’s views into consideration when making policy decisions.   For Scotland, leaving the UK would also be a mistake. Scotland has benefitted from being part of the UK in terms of shared defense and foreign policy, as well as the Economy. Scotland has an annual budget deficit which the UK government currently covers, and this would no longer be the case if Scotland were to leave. Additionally, Scotland would no longer have access to the UK’s security and intelligence services, which are a key asset to the country.   In conclusion, it is reasonable to conclude that the passing of Brexit will likely lead to a literal dividing of the UK, which would undoubtedly be a mistake for the UK, as well as Scotland.
44	I appreciate your response, However, I believe that the security of the country should not be prioritized over trade, as borders are an important part of fostering relationships and facilitating commerce. Moreover, there are many other nations within the EU who are suffering from the same migrant and terrorist crises, and yet do not have the economic power of the UK. Open borders are not the sole cause of these issues, and closing them may not necessarily prevent the same crises from occurring in the UK. In addition, maintaining close ties with the other member states of the EU will help ensure the UK’s access to the necessary resources and capabilities to safeguard its security. Therefore, I still believe that the UK's continued membership of the EU is the best way to ensure its security and prosperity.
45	I will begin by addressing my opponent’s argument that Britain has historically had strong ties to Europe and has prospered from it. While this is true, it does not necessarily mean that Britain will remain prosperous if it remains in the EU. In recent years, economies such as Greece, France, and Spain have been struggling, and this could be a sign of things to come if Britain remains in the EU. Furthermore, Britain may have to take on a larger share of refugees and migrants from Europe as the EU continues to be resettled, which could further put a strain on the British economy.  My opponent then argued that Britain should and must exit from the EU. While this is a matter of opinion, I would argue that the costs of exiting the EU have not been fully explored. In particular, Britain would no longer have the same access to the single market, and would have to pay tariffs on goods coming from the EU. This could have a detrimental effect on the British economy, and would be a much higher cost than the current membership fee. Additionally, Britain would no longer be part of the European Court of Justice, meaning that it would have less control over its own laws and would no longer be able to influence the decisions of the EU. These are costs that should not be overlooked.
46	My opponent seems to be missing the point. I'm not saying one shouldn't use sources. What I'm saying is that when you do use a source, you need to use quotation marks, and reference your source. If you don't, you're guilty of plagiarism. Furthermore, when making an argument, it is important to back it up with evidence or other reliable sources to strengthen your argument. As such, I urge the voters to reject my opponent's arguments, as they are based on a bare assertion and lack reliable evidence to support them.
47	The United Kingdom needs to leave the European Union in order to reduce the number of issues faced by people in England due to migration. The people of England are struggling with unemployment, education, and healthcare. Not every individual has the financial means to afford a life of inactivity, and yet that is the consequence of the current state of affairs. Creating new industries may be difficult in the short-term, but it would be beneficial for citizens of England since it would provide employment opportunities. Additionally, this would open the door for trade with other countries, expanding horizons and possibilities for growth.
48	The
49	I thank my opponent for their argument. The point of my argument was to demonstrate that the United Kingdom should not remain in the European Union. I focused on the issue of multiculturalism, as I believe that the country is stronger when it maintains a sense of unity and shared identity, rather than becoming a "cultural melting pot". The examples of the Celts, Angles, Saxons, Frisians, and Normans I used were to demonstrate that the British people are not a single homogenous group, but rather a mix of different cultures. The point I was making is that Britain is stronger when it maintains its identity, and that diversity can be seen as a strength rather than a weakness. I believe the UK will benefit from operating outside of the European Union, with greater freedom to make its own laws and economic policies. I also rebutted the argument that Britain would benefit from free trade by demonstrating that the countries within the European Union have a tendency to protect their own industries, to the detriment of British businesses. With regards to the issue of migration, I believe that the UK should not close its borders. Again, I argued that the UK should embrace the diversity of cultures that exist within its borders, rather than try to isolate itself from the rest of the world. I further argued that economic migrants and refugees should be allowed to seek refuge in the UK, and that closing our borders would be going backwards. Finally, I wished to emphasize the fact that the decision to remain or leave the European Union is a matter of national sovereignty, and that it should ultimately be decided by the British people.
50	1. I would like to address the points made in R1. I do not think my opponent understands the definition of "the defendant chooses". It is not the judge that makes the decision to chose life or death. It is the defendant. That is why it is called the death penalty. The judge merely imposes the sentence after the defendant has decided. 2. I addressed the point made in R2 in my last round. International law is not a major factor in deterring crime and thus it would not be a major factor in whether or not a country has a death penalty. 3. It is true that there is a risk of executing innocent people. However, the risk can be greatly reduced if proper safeguards are implemented. For example, the Innocence Project, which has freed numerous innocent people from death row, has found that DNA evidence can exonerate people wrongfully convicted. Therefore, the risk of executing innocent people can be drastically reduced if the proper measures are taken. 4. It is true that race and socio-economic status can be factors in death penalty cases, but this can be reduced by using race-neutral safeguards, such as requiring unanimous jury verdicts or mandating death penalty cases be reviewed by the US Supreme Court. 5. This point is a double-edged sword. On one hand, the death penalty is designed to protect the community from dangerous criminals. On the other hand, the death penalty can be seen as a form of vengeance and it has
51	In round 1, my opponent argued that the death penalty should not be implemented because it is "unfair, kills innocents, and doesn't even serve it's deterrence purpose, and on top of that is is expensive". I will now demonstrate that these claims are invalid.   Firstly, the death penalty is not necessarily unfair. While it is true that innocent people can be wrongly convicted and sentenced to death, there are several safeguards in place to prevent this from occurring. In order to ensure that only guilty people are executed, every death penalty case must undergo a comprehensive review and appeal process. This process involves numerous levels of review, including appeals to higher courts, which provide opportunities to prove innocence or to have a sentence of death commuted to a sentence of life imprisonment. The death penalty is also an effective deterrent against crime. Recent studies have shown that the death penalty can serve as a powerful deterrent to potential criminals as the possibility of execution deters many from committing a crime in the first place. Finally, the death penalty is not as expensive as my opponent suggests. The cost of executing a criminal is far less than the cost of keeping that person in prison for their entire life, as is the case with many death row inmates. In fact, a study conducted by the National Research Council found that the cost of keeping a prisoner in prison for life can be as much as 18 times more expensive than executing the same individual. Thus, the death penalty is not as expensive as my opponent claims.   Furthermore, I would argue that a death penalty that is implemented as a voluntary option for defendants is even more effective in deterring crime and preventing the execution of innocent people. In such a system, defendants will only be able to choose death if they believe that death is the only just punishment for their crime, eliminating the chance that innocent people will be wrongly executed. Additionally, if the defendant knows that he has the option to choose death, he is more likely to think twice before committing a crime as the risk of execution is real and present. As such, a voluntary death penalty would be even more effective in deterring crime and preventing the execution of innocent people than an involuntary death penalty.
52	First of all I would like to make my "points" as to why I am opposed to the death penalty. 1. The cost of a death penalty case is much higher than the cost of a comparable non-death penalty case due to the need to provide more resources such as specialized medical personnel, larger jury boxes, and special security measures. A 2003 legislative audit in Kansas found that the estimated cost of a death penalty case was 70% more than the cost of a comparable non-death penalty case. Death penalty case costs were counted through to execution (median cost $1.26 million). Non-death penalty case costs were counted through to the end of incarceration (median cost $740,000). (December 2003 Survey by the Kansas Legislative Post Audit).   In Tennessee, death penalty trials cost an average of 48% more than the average cost of trials in which prosecutors seek life imprisonment. (2004 Report from Tennessee Comptroller of the Treasury Office of Research).   In Maryland death penalty cases cost 3 times more than non-death penalty cases, or $3 million for a single case. (Urban Institute, The Cost of the Death Penalty in Maryland, March 2008).   In California the current system costs $137 million per year; it would cost $11.5 million for a system without the death penalty. Innocence  Until I can be sure that everyone sentenced to death in Illinois is truly guilty, until I can be sure with moral certainty that no innocent man or woman is facing a lethal injection, no one will meet that fate. (Governor George Ryan of Illinois).   Since 1973, 130 people have been released from death rows throughout the country due to evidence of their wrongful convictions. In 2003 alone, 10 wrongfully convicted defendants were released from death row.   There are no proven records that say that states that have the death penalty have lower crimes rates of any sort. People do not think right before they shot a guy in the face. "Oh wait, this state has the death penalty". Actually, states that do not have the death penalty have lower crime rates http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org...   Would you agree that spending 23 hours in the day for the rest of your life in a 6 ft" by 6 ft" box thinking about what you have done, letting the misery eat you away for the rest of your life is worse then dyeing   And shouldn't the state be considered a murderer for killing someone as well?
53	The United States has several ways on how criminals should be punished. The most important punishments are serving time in prison and the death penalty. The death penalty is the worst punishment that a judge could sentence a defendant. The death penalty should be removed from the punishments the United States provides for its defendants, because in many cases it is not a 100% chance that the defendant did in fact commit the crime. In cases where the defendant actually did commit the crime, they should still be convicted a life sentence in prison, rather than the death penalty. If the death penalty is sentenced to a defendant, who according to evidence presented in court did in fact commit the crime, instead of this being the worst thing that could ever happen, it could be an easy way out; the defendant to not serve a life sentence. When it comes to money, the United States may be spending more per having prisoners serve life sentences, then sentencing the death penalty.  However, the death penalty is still not a way of justice. The death penalty is a waste of taxpayers' money, and has no public safety benefit. Instead, the death penalty has a main motive of revenge, instead of justice. The death penalty can be considered as violating the U.S. Constitution, because it is considered a cruel and unusual punishment, and the guarantees of the due process of law and of equal protection under the law are violated. The States should not give themselves the right to kill human beings, whatever the crime may have been, it is much more revenge than it is justice. According to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the majority of the law enforcement professionals, surveyed agree that capital punishment does not deter violent crime; a survey of police chiefs nationwide found they rank the death penalty lowest among ways to reduce violent crimes. It is obvious that even law enforcement professionals do not agree with the death penalty. The death penalty does not stop crimes that continue in the streets every day, it only kills one human being who may have committed the crime they are being accused of. If money is the issue for having too many prisoners, there is such a thing as rehabilitation centers, which is what prisons are sentenced certain amount of time to serve in the first place. It is much better to have someone spend their life in prison, rather than giving them the easy way out through the death penalty. The doubt of someone actually committing the crime they are being accused of, and going forward with the death penalty is a doubt that will not go away. The fact that an innocent human being was sentenced to the death penalty is a life that is lost and cannot be gained back. The fatal constitutional infirmity in the punishment of death, is that it treats members of the human race as nonhuman, as objects to be toyed with and discarded. Lives should not be toyed with when facing a severe punishment as the death penalty. Aside from the death penalty being the worst punishment, the need for a physician to be present to conduct the procedure is in violation of the oath they take upon, which is to protect lives; this erodes public confidence in the medical profession. The use of a physician's clinical skill and judgment for purposes other than promoting an individual's health and welfare undermines a basic ethical foundation of medicine, which is to do no harm. Instead of the death penalty being a way of stopping crimes, the fact that one person is being named for committing a crime is not accurate, it violates the Constitution, and more importantly those physicians who are certified to save lives , are going against their oath and helping with the prosecution.
54	The death penalty is an issue that has been debated for centuries, with some arguing that it serves as a deterrent to crime while others claiming that it is an expensive form of vengeance that does not provide any rehabilitation for the convicted. Those in favor of the death penalty argue that it provides justice for the victims and their families and serves as a deterrent to criminal activity. The opposing argument is that it costs more than life in prison and can lead to innocent people being executed.
