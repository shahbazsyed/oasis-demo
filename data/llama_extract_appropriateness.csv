0	Porn is wrong as it can lead to feelings of guilt and regret, and it can divert time and energy away from more productive pursuits. It may also increase the risk of sexual assault due to desensitization.
1	Some places consider low income to be quite high, even when couples earn $400-$600 a week. WIC, Daycare Assistance, and other services are available to help them.
2	Sadism as the practice of violence or cruelty against others to fulfil some sort of personal or sexual gratification is, in my opinion, the most sickening act a person can commit. In order to commit such an act, the person must be subjugated and therefore weaker than the active participant, thus compounding the act of violence. This is "evil". However where both, or all individuals are consenting active participants, I believe this to be a form of masochism, albeit from the hands of another. Although this statement may seem to be an oxymoron, if you pursue pain and violence, and consequently receive it from the hands of another, is this not just "assisted" masochism? (a la assisted suicide) Although these individuals may be strange, what two (or more) consenting adults do in private is no concern of mine.
3	We should invest in researching animal combinations, such as a half gorilla-half octopus, as it could lead to incredible results. Furthermore, the "don't play god" argument does not apply, as no one is concerned about God punishing us for creating odd creatures. Additionally, the potential results - such as a turtle with a chicken head - would be worth the cost and risk.
4	Gun control is seen by some as a way to reduce crime, but others argue that it does not have enough of an effect, and that criminals will still find ways to acquire weapons. However, statistics show that citizens with guns can deter crime, and the Second Amendment is in place to provide citizens the ability to fight against an out of control government.
5	Being horny is a sin, according to religion. Wanking is a sin, according to religion. Having sex with your girlfriend is a sin, according to religion. Rape is a sin, according to religion. Teaching morals instead of religion would not put these natural feelings in the same category as sin.
6	Lesbians are often seen as more socially acceptable than gay men because of traditional gender roles and societal expectations of men and women. Additionally, lesbians are more "socially acceptable" for one of the traditional reasons behind homophobia: women are viewed as inferior to men. Gay men are discriminated against because they have no honor: romantic interest in men is for women only, and when an man participates he is "lowering himself" to a women's level.
7	The Chinese government is oppressive to those who question its motives or policies, and America chooses to ignore it due to preserving good economic relations. Slavery is still widespread in China, and this should be addressed.
8	The argument is that caricatures of Muhammad published in a Danish newspaper were not ethical and were even insensitive, but Muslims are not protesting against the suicide bombers who are killing other Muslims in Iraq. The suicide bombers are the ones who do not respect others beliefs, not the caricatures.
9	Life is not fair, and success often comes from taking risks and playing to win, rather than being compassionate and taking the kind approach. People who take this approach can still be successful even if they are not nice, while those who follow a more ethical path may still be treated unfairly despite their efforts.
10	Scott Peterson was the white contrast to OJ Simpson. He was not a celebrity, but an "everyman". Like OJ, he killed the mother of his children. The similarities stopped there. He and Laci, were nice looking so the TV images were good. We watched it for the same reason we watched Michael Douglas and Glen Close in Fatal Attraction. Scott is just an average white guy. As with most people who have an affair, particularly when the wife is at home pregnant, his version of reality went off the reservation. It was a warning sign to the rest of us. Don't lose sight of reality and think that life will be great after you kill your pregnant wife and hook up with the psycho-chic who was f**king you while your wife was pregnant. If you are an average white guy, you do not get off for a crime like OJ got off. It still seems that a black celebrity can work his celebrity magic on a jury - right Michael?
11	Israel has the right to retaliate against Hamas for firing 2000 missiles into Israel over the past two weeks, despite numerous attempts by Israel to enforce a ceasefire without retaliation. Hamas' main goal of destroying Israel leaves Israel with no option but to neutralize the terrorist organization in order to protect the safety of Israeli citizens. Hamas is actively trying to increase civilian casualties by firing missiles from civilian buildings, making Israel's civilians innocent victims and therefore justifying retaliation. The invasion of Gaza to prevent further bombings is a necessary and morally justified action.
12	The government should not be in the marriage business and should instead record marriages or civil unions and grant equal rights to all. Plural "marriages" exist but are not supported by a significant part of the population, and should be addressed in a separate debate. In the author's opinion, the purpose of marriage or civil union is to provide support for individuals and particularly for those who are raising children. The most monogamous couples the author knows are gay and are great parents.
13	Universities today are more focused on producing figures for employment statistics than inspiring students and creating passionate learners. There is a lack of appreciation for the work students do, as well as apathy towards the projects they create. Universities have lost their true meaning and are simply a production line for the corporate world.
14	Bad Company 2 is boring due to its lack of intensity, difficult vehicle control, large maps, and predictable enemy location. Call of Duty: MW2, on the other hand, offers intense gameplay with its realistic weapons and small maps, making it more exciting to play. Bad Company also lacks the great features of MW2, such as the ability to hide and throw grenades, and the need to go get enemies instead of being able to drive around in a battleground looking for them. MW2 also has better weapon variety and more realistic weapon behavior. In short, Battlefield: Bad Company 2 is boring compared to Call of Duty: MW2.
15	Execution should be televised in order to spread information about the death penalty and to act as a deterrent against crime.
16	Democracy cannot be imposed on Muslim countries, as they lack the necessary Enlightenment background which allowed for its formation in the United States.  Islam demands that church and state be unified, making it difficult for a secular constitutional republic to take root.  Despite attempts to bring democracy to these countries, we see its failure in the form of blowback.  We can only keep these countries in check through military force, which is not a sustainable solution.
17	People often bend or break laws when the penalty is not too severe, such as speeding or not wearing a seatbelt. When laws violate someone's rights, they are morally wrong, but changing or modifying these laws is a difficult process.
18	The Hulk is incredibly strong, and gets stronger the angrier she gets, making her difficult to defeat. Optimus Prime has many weapons and is powerful, but he cannot defeat the Hulk.
19	The expectation for men to put the toilet seat down after urinating is an unreasonable request, as it is unreasonable to expect men to put the seat up after use and it cancels out. Additionally, in a large building or household, the next user could be male and need to urinate, in which case they would need to put the seat up again. Furthermore, why would men use a shared toilet without looking before use while expecting male users to look for both themselves and the women?
20	The Government of Maharashtra recently imposed a ban on ladies bars due to numerous complaints from housewives about their male family members wasting money and not taking care of the family. Additionally, criminal activities that took place at these bars, such as the Tarannum and Telgi cases, prompted the government to act.
21	Marriage has always been between a man and a woman, and morality is key to the survival of society. If two people want to live in sin together, they should not be rewarded with tax breaks, and this public exposure/support of homosexuals is not beneficial for society.
22	The storm-cloaks are painted as the complete villains of the civil war in Skyrim due to their racism and abuse of power, which makes their part of the story weaker. Additionally, Ulfric's use of the Thu'um to kill the High King makes him the mastermind of the civil war, and further strengthens the idea that the storm-cloaks are the bad guys.
23	India has the potential to lead the world, as evidenced by the fact that fifty percent of the scientists in NASA are IITians. If given the proper environment, IITians, students who qualify for IIT, and superbrains, could contribute significantly to India's development. However, this potential is not being realized due to factors such as brain drain, lack of industrial development, and inadequate salaries. India needs to improve its industrial sector in order to fulfill its potential.
24	Porn hardly ever leads to addiction, just in weak people, maybe who have mental health issues, or attachment issues or find it hard to separate fantasy from reality. People who watch porn once or twice a day might still be able to maintain a healthy relationship and have sex regularly with their partner.
25	Young men are often charged higher insurance rates than women due to statistical data showing they may be more likely to be involved in accidents. However, this should not be a sufficient reason to treat men differently than women, as is the case with race and imprisonment rates. Men should receive the same insurance rates as women regardless of gender.
26	Jesus was the Son of God who was crucified by the Romans, but then rose from the dead, according to the accounts of early Christians. He was a Nazarene and was married, according to some accounts. There is no evidence to suggest that he was not married. The whole controversy is based on whether or not he rose from the dead, with some claiming that there are eye witness accounts of his resurrection. What can be said to prove that he didn't rise from the dead?
27	India reservation helps some people in need but not all. It was implemented to reduce socialism and economic inequality. However, it is being abused by some people, which causes opposition. The benefits of reservation are not reaching the actual people in need, instead, some people from these societies who are already privileged are taking advantage of it.
28	Russian people generally dislike foreigners in their country due to a combination of factors, including the country's reputation for violence and corruption, as well as a sense of nationalism and patriotism.
29	Freedom of speech should be of unlimited proportions, but it should be balanced with personal responsibility and accountability. The Islamic world is overreacting and making themselves look foolish by rioting over cartoons.
30	Latinos should not use culture as an excuse for their actions, as other immigrant groups have learned to adjust to new countries while still preserving their culture. All Latinos are not the same and should be held to the same standards as other immigrant groups. It is important to learn and respect the customs and traditions of the country you are in, but culture should not be used as an excuse to avoid responsibility.
31	No, we shouldn't prioritize exploring space over focusing on solving Earth's problems, because our world has more urgent issues to address, such as poverty, population growth, pollution, and climate change, which could lead to the death of billions of people if left unchecked. Focusing on space exploration could be seen as a distraction from more urgent matters.
32	Smoking ban: Prohibition or social engineering? Some argue that it should be the owner of the property who decides whether a place is smoking or non-smoking, while others feel that it should be a government choice. Some people feel that the money from a potential smoking ban should go to a “clean air fund”, but others feel that this is just a way for people to control and make money. Ultimately, it should be the individual's choice whether or not to allow smoking in public places.
33	The "Culture of Life" republicans have been widely criticized for their hypocrisy in not protesting this case of political abuse of power, despite claiming to be pro-life. The woman in question was a poor immigrant, not a middle class white woman, and her family was not being torn apart by the situation, as was the case with Terri Schiavo. Furthermore, the incident did not occur during an election year, and the public was already in an uproar over the Bush administration's similar handling of a different case. All in all, the "Culture of Life" republicans have been exposed as nothing more than opportunistic hypocrites.
34	The U.S. has one of the strongest navies in the World with a total of 366 military ships in commission. Despite this, the U.S. has only 4 military ships in the area at risk of pirate attacks, which is insufficient to protect the vast expanse of sea. Therefore, more U.S. ships should be deployed to the region in order to safeguard the trade routes and countries around it.
35	While some may argue that teenage sexuality should be banned entirely, others believe that it should be taught as a natural part of life and that jailing teenagers for having sex will only increase the amount of teenagers engaging in risky behavior.
36	The establishment of Israel is often cited as necessary to protect Jewish people, however, annexing a portion of Germany could have been a more morally justifiable option than creating an independent state in Palestine based on a religion-based claim.
37	Massachusetts melanie's law has the potential to limit actions based on speculation rather than actual harm, which could potentially violate civil liberties. Reason and logic have been abandoned in favor of making headlines.
38	Christianity should be supported because of faith in God, while atheism is false and cannot prove the non-existence of God. Both sides contradict each other, and neither can claim victory. Christianity will continue to prevail due to faith, regardless of atheism's proof of God's nonexistence.
39	Most woman feel guilty, ashamed and embarrassed after having an abortion, despite feeling that it was their only way out of the situation.
40	You are insured on your father's policy, and your friend is responsible for any medical bills or insurance costs that arise from the accident as he did not list you as a separate driver. This is not an ethical problem for you, as you were not at fault.
41	The argument is about a person who does not like the vast majority of their family, who finds them to be rude and obnoxious, yet their parents believe that they should care about them since they are family. The person explains that they don't need or want their family's help, and find the whole situation to be frustrating. The parents argue that their family won't be around forever and that they would do anything for them, to which the person responds that they don't care that their family would do anything for them. They find it to be similar to having a random stranger say that they would do anything for them and that they don't need to care about them or want their help. In conclusion, the person does not like the vast majority of their family, finds them to be rude and obnoxious, and does not want or need their help.
42	Insurance companies are allowed to profile customers based on certain risk factors, but law enforcement is not due to the potential of serious consequences. Moreover, the type of discrimination by insurance companies does not have the same impact on individuals as that of law enforcement.
43	It is acceptable for men to pee while sitting down, and it has nothing to do with being gay because it does not involve sexuality. It may be done for convenience, such as when one is in a rush or having morning wood, and it has become more common among men.
44	Ok, so in the workplace, is it right for a person's boyfriend to join the union, and what can be done to avoid any issues? Unions are legal and allowed to sign up members, but this situation seems to be going a bit far. Unless the boyfriend has done something to cross a picket line, then he had better know he will not be liked or respected, and that is why he is being called a rat and a scab. Also, is the other man an illegal alien? If so, then INS could come in and send him back.  In regards to unionism, it grows when employees feel that management is not treating them fairly and respecting the work that they do. When people do not feel valued or respected, or acknowledged for their contributions, then they become angry and push back in the only way they know how, as a group. Unions are not all demons, nor is management always the enemy, but if that is how management and union posture themselves, then there won't be any labour peace.
45	The term 'Redskin' is not equivalent to the N word, as it is not commonly used in a derogatory manner and is not synonymous with the hate speech that the N word carries.
46	A personal pursuit is a better endeavor than advancing the common good, because helping family is more important than helping a stranger. However, if helping a family member is not possible, then advancing the common good should be prioritized.
47	The argument is against the view that not paying income tax is a part of freedom, as it was not the case during the founding of the US. Income tax is still enforced, despite its being unconstitutional, through compliance procedures and sanctions.
48	The media is permitted to invade people's privacy, but it is not acceptable for private citizens or the government to do so. This is because the former is justified ethically, as it is an exercise of the freedom of the press, while the latter is not considered ethical because it violates the privacy of individuals. Meanwhile, people have the right to know what the government is doing with their money, as it is with their money that the government is acting.
49	It has been proven to many people that 9/11 was an inside job, though some people are hesitant to believe it due to their faith in the government. These people will wake up when the country is under Martial law and curfews are imposed, or if they end up in one of the 600+ concentration camps that have been built.
50	Installation art at the Tate Modern, especially since Duchamp's Fountain, has become boring and repetitive. It has failed to live up to the potential of challenging the status quo and has become little more than dull toys put on display. Despite this, it remains popular in the UK and is seen as a sign of cultural superiority.
51	The argument suggests that Bush should be impeached because of his war crimes and crimes against humanity.
52	Poland Spring employs a rigorous quality control standard to ensure consistency and safety in the production of their water. This includes a multi-barrier filtration system and monitoring of disinfection processes, as well as frequent testing for contaminants.
53	Fathers must take action to obtain legal visitation rights if the mother is not allowing them to see their children, as California is generally fair in these cases. An attorney should be consulted from the jurisdiction of the latest court order in order to ensure a fair shake for the father. Not granting visitation rights can have long-term emotional scars on the children, so it is important for fathers to take action and fight for their rights.
54	The majority of poor Americans are content with their situation and lack motivation to work or pursue education, while others are held back by physical or mental health problems or a difficult start in life. This has been further reinforced by the "soft" society created by easy access to video games and lax schooling.
55	I don't believe the World's climate is static and unchanging, but I think it is being overly dramatized by the media. Additionally, I don't believe in the current climate change agenda which is backed by politicians who want to maintain their credibility. I used to be into the scientific side of it, but I haven't for a while. Despite this, I am in contact with someone who shares my opinion and is knowledgeable in the science. Skepticism and opposition to conventional scientific thinking should be encouraged, and I think it is appalling how disregarded it is.
56	Humans are artificial intelligence but have rights, but if we were to create another being capable of being a sentient life form it wouldn't be equal to us.  This being would have to reach the same level as us in order to be equal,  and this could only happen if we were able to create such a being in the same image and likeness of our creator. Otherwise it would never be our equal.
57	In Illinois, if an employee is injured on the job, they must fill out an accident report and inform their supervisor. If an employee fails to do so, they may not have a case for workers' compensation. Furthermore, if the employee has previously discussed their back pain with their supervisor and fails to get a signed affidavit from them, they may not have a case.
58	Marijuana laws in the US should be reformed, as punishing pot smokers is not effective and does not align with other similar offenses such as spitting in the street. There are some states which have already implemented reform, while NORML (National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws) can provide further information and help with the movement for change.
59	The U.S. has approximately 1/20th of the world's population, yet holds 1/3 of the world's prison population. This is due to the country's "war on crime" and "war on drugs" started in the late 70s and early 80s. African-Americans have a rate of over 6,000 incarcerated per 100,000.
60	It is reasonable to let some criminals vote while they are incarcerated, such as those who are not felons and are truly reformed. However, repeat offenders who have committed violent crimes should not be allowed to vote.
61	Rudy's is a popular barbecue chain in Texas, known for their brisket and peppery sauce. A Rudy's located in Chandler, AZ was recently visited by the reviewer, who enjoyed their food and sauce but not the brisket/egg taco.
62	Gay marriages do not hurt anyone and should not be a sin to keep two people who love each other apart. God accepts everyone, and His people should follow that by not judging or discriminating against those in same-sex relationships.
63	In the debate of pro choice versus pro life, there should be no argument as to what the fetus is: it is a living form that has been created in a very intimate manner, regardless of how one views the conception. Additionally, in cases of rape, the woman should be allowed to give the child up for adoption, as it is not the child's fault for being created in such a manner. Ultimately, the decision should be left to the mother as to whether or not to abort the pregnancy.
64	I went deep sea fishing last weekend on the invitation of a friend and we caught, fought, and then released some ten to fifteen fish. In order to catch those fish, we first caught a lot of bait fish - live fish which we caught the night before, then later jammed a giant hook through their still live bodies and tossed them in to the water. I cannot find any reason to justify this behavior as a moral human being. The bait fish suffered badly when caught, suffered more when we jammed a hook through their face, and suffered even more as they were stalked by larger fish and the suffering then ended when they were eaten. At which point the other fish suffered with a hook through ITS face, fought for their lives as I dragged them to the surface, then removed the hook and started over. I did not like it. Except... I DID. Fishers, please change my view.
65	Florida's major metropolitan areas are thriving, with technology, trade and commerce, and entertainment. Despite taking a battering economy wise, SWFL has nothing to offer but the retired and snowbirds. Tourism is an economic driver, but it should not be the only one. It is time to change the view and make SWFL more dynamic and attractive. An opportunity may arise for a move to Tampa Bay if there is the means to do so.
66	The "Good Ole' Boys" in Congress are blocking progress and working to protect their own interests. Term limits and new legislators are necessary to shake up the system and get things done.
67	People submitting comments solely consisting of pop culture references are a sign of their vacuousness and lack of original thought, as evidenced by the author seeing similar comments on Reddit. Original thoughts require deep insight and analysis, which these comments lack. It is evident that the commenters do not possess the capacity to generate their own thoughts and thus depend on popular culture references as a crutch. The author concludes that this is a sign of their infantile state and vacuity.
68	The US is friendly with China because it needs the economic benefits that come with the relationship. Cuba, on the other hand, is blocked out because it has limited economic potential. This allows the US to flex its power in the region while maintaining its influence over Cuba.
69	The parent of an 18-year-old is not obligated to pay for their child's living expenses if they are living on their own in high school, depending on the state. If the minor is living with their father, support may be necessary through high school in most custody agreements. In this case, it sounds like the parent is dealing with a 18-year-old who is self-destructing, and no support from the parent is needed if the minor is living independently.
70	Unions should be able to use PACs and Super PACs during election season to counteract the influence of corporations, which are already able to donate a vast amount of money to politicians. This would be a democratic check to the power of capital and a way for unions to express their political views.
71	Farquhar was instrumental in helping to found Singapore, but he was not the sole founder and was only involved under the authority of Stamford Raffles. Thus, he should not be regarded as the sole founder of Singapore.
72	People aren't pediphiles but still lazy fat asses who spend all their time posing as 16 year old boys over the internet.
73	Soccer players who overly exaggerate injuries should receive a yellow card for their pusillanimous behavior, which gives a poor image to the sport and is unsportsmanlike. Alternatively, legitimate injuries should be acknowledged, but players should also be encouraged to brush off minor bumps and go back into the game like other sports.
74	Psilocybin (Shrooms) and LSD are relatively harmless compared to other drugs, and aren't addictive. Despite this, they should still be regulated, as with any other substance, to ensure they aren't abused.
75	The man was innocent and should not have been forced to register as a sex offender despite not being convicted of a crime. He should have received a lecture on smartening up in our lawsuit and sex-crime crazed society, and the parents should have gotten a lecture on teaching their daughter.
76	The United States should not provide freedom to other countries if it cannot make peace within its own borders. People have lost sight of what freedom means and are voting wrong, leading the country in the wrong direction. Additionally, people need to take responsibility for their actions and not blame them on science or society. Furthermore, the budget for the state and national levels, as well as the economy and taxes, will be affected if nothing is done to put things in place for a better country and community. We pay for all of this in the long run with our taxes, not the so-called federal and state money people think we have.
77	Without universal soldiers and bomb makers, there might be fewer wars as people would have less control over each other and would instead focus on peaceful activities.
78	Gay marriage is a lifestyle choice and should be accepted and respected, despite any discomfort it may cause. Love is the most important part of the equation, and forcing people to live a life of loneliness because their sexual orientation makes others uncomfortable is cruel. God created them the way they are, and they have done nothing wrong. Everyone should have the right to pursue happiness with their loved ones, no matter their sexual orientation.
79	Having a lousy father can have its practical benefits, such as not prying into a child's business or taking their stuff. On the other hand, it can also be emotionally damaging, as demonstrated by the speaker's story. In the end, it is up to the individual to decide whether having a lousy father is better than being fatherless.
80	CarCraze - You are wrong, sorry to say. What you have there is a bona fide Court Order for you to appear in court to answer to a Motion to Collect a Debt. If it is on Court paper and has a case number, call the Court to confirm the Docket Number, and find out when the hearing date is. YES, they do have that power. YES, That is the equivalent of a Subpoena. If you "just let it ride", as you say, don't be surprised when you open up your paycheck and you find a good chunk of it GONE ! What you should do is seek legal counsel (get a lawyer) and come up with a manageable payment plan that is both satisfactory to your creditor, and workable for you. DON'T HESITATE - you will regret it.
81	I agree that performance enhancing drugs should not be allowed in professional sports due to the potential harm they can cause to athletes and the increased risk of usage among young athletes. Legalization would also cause a ripple effect of usage in both professional and amateur athletes, leading to an unhealthy and unlevel playing field.
82	Nancy Pelosi cannot remove an elected official from office unless the official has broken a law or has acted improperly in a manner that violates judicial ethics, which could include the appearance of impropriety. In some cases, merely being suspected of wrongdoing is not enough; the official must have actually done something illegal. The removal of an official can only occur through a supermajority vote of the House. The freezer full of cash incident does not constitute illegal activity, so removal of the official is not possible.
83	Judges can be bought, but they are not the real problem. The issue lies in the new Supreme Court Justices who mix their political views with the law and believe they have a responsibility to "fix" what they perceive to be wrong in the world. This is a major threat to justice, as it is scary to think what these judges might do with their newfound power.
84	Margaret Thatcher's time as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom saw large-scale decay in British industries, widespread poverty in Wales, Scotland and the North of England, and was highly unpopular in Ireland due to her stance on the hunger strikes. Despite this, one man from London thought highly of her, to the disbelief of the speaker.
85	Cosleeping should always be discouraged and never encouraged as it is dangerous and can destroy intimacy in parent's relationships, as well as make it harder to stop later on. Basinets are a better option as they are small, convenient, and can easily be attached to beds.
86	Getting child support raised requires requesting a review by the child support office, which verifies income with the employer and may grant cost of living increases or adjustments for changing circumstances. The amount may also be increased if the parents were very young when they had the child and the non-custodial parent has a more decent job now.
87	India has the potential to lead the world but it is not yet fully developed and powerful enough to do so. Other countries like the USA, United Kingdom, Russia, and Japan are currently more progressive and possess greater potential. India is not as technologically advanced as some countries in the Americas, and technology is an essential invention that India needs to develop further in order to lead the world.
88	Minimum wage jobs generally do not offer any potential for promotions or raises, so employers cannot reasonably expect more effort than the bare minimum from employees in these positions. Furthermore, some jobs require skills and intellect which should be compensated accordingly.
89	I believe that if a person has the strength to consider or act on suicide, they have the strength to continue living. It is not sensible to choose death over life when you have the capability of the former. Therefore, the topic of discussion is whether or not a person who has the strength to kill themselves has the strength to live on.
90	States should have the right to create their own gun laws, and the national government should not intervene. Gun control laws in individual states should be tailored to local needs and circumstances and there is no reason why national standards should be imposed. Criminals will always find ways to get guns, so it is better to make sure that law-abiding citizens can protect themselves.
91	The phrase "be a man" is at best outdated and at worst sexist, as it implies that men are the leaders and protectors of society and that non-traditionally masculine men are not supposed to have certain values. A gender-neutral phrase such as "be a better person" would be more inclusive and neutral.
92	The myth that healthy food is more expensive than junk is often perpetuated by those who are overweight, as they are more likely to buy cheaper, unhealthy food options. However, in reality, healthy food is often much more affordable than junk food, with supermarkets offering a wide range of healthy food options at a reasonable price.
93	Yahoo! Answers is politically and racially biased, as evidenced by their willingness to hand over user data to the Bush administration and their active suppression of questioners and answerers who do not adhere to the Republican agenda. Even when users are not being purposely malicious, they willingly ignore questions which violate their standards of decency but allow those that are not offensive in a political way. This suggests that their bias is motivated by a conservative political ideology.
94	ADHD and some forms of autism may not be a disease, but instead the next step in human evolution. Those with ADHD can hyperfocus and accomplish great things when they apply themselves. People with autism can also be highly proficient in certain skills, such as math, science and music, and should be encouraged to become their own unique and amazing individuals. Human evolution is advancing due to these traits, and we should celebrate that!
95	Many people have inconsistent views on certain topics due to the mixture of other people's opinions. This leads to hypocritical behaviour in which they claim to be pro-life, pro-choice or conservative, but the views they hold are not fully thought through. It is impossible to consider every issue thoroughly, and this leads to inconsistencies in people's opinions. Defending every unheard voice of every oppressed person is worthwhile, regardless of whether it is in the womb or in Iraq.
96	Cmv: road kill doesn't matter, a neutral response to seeing an animal being killed is fine.  It makes sense to feel nothing for the animal as it is another of the many organisms which die and don't effect our lives in any meaningful way.
97	Coherent gist:  Convinceme is the administrator of the website and has the power to decide what is appropriate and what is not. Even though he has not outlined any guidelines, user upholding convinceme has the right to decide what is appropriate and what is not and is acting upon it by flagging debates that he deems inappropriate.
98	Saddam is a feared and respected figure in Iraq, and the verdict in his trial will not be accepted easily by the people. His death penalty trial has been motivated by the Americans, but it has caused unrest in the country due to the Shia-Sunni divide.
