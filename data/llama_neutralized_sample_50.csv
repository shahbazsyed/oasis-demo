0	The argument that porn would expose one to the reality in life, and thus increasing one's maturity and prevent possible future sexual assaults, is totally crap.  Porn is definitely wrong. After a dosage, the guilt of wasting ur time, wasting energy, wasting effort and not devoting urself to another thing and regretting that you should not have started would almost kill you. Trust me.  It's a road that should not be taken, it's as bad as smoking and drugs. I think the only reason it's not banned in most developed countries is that they are facing an aging population.
1	No I haven't but (it sounds like its a friend) and it sounds like she can get help through a pro-bono place, or a low income based legal services. YOU WOULD BE SURPRISED  at what some places consider LOW INCOME. My sisters husband brings home at least $400.00 a wk (in winter) and at least $600.00 a wk. in summer, and they have a 3 person household. They get approx. $46,000 a year bring home and they get help from W.I.C, Daycare Asst., food excetra. So tell her - or help her, find those services.   Action: Replace 'No I haven't' with 'Yes, I have'. Replace 'get help' with 'apply for help'. Replace 'at least' with 'up to'. Replace'summer' with'summer months'. Replace 'they' with'she and her husband'. Replace 'they get' with 'they receive'. Replace 'W.I.C' with 'Women, Infants, and Children'. Replace 'Daycare Asst' with 'Child Care Subsidy'. Replace 'food excetra' with 'food and other expenses'.   Reason 1: To make the argument appropriate for a civil debate.  Reason 2: To make the argument more concise and specific.  Reason 3: To make the argument more focused on the topic of the debate.  Reason 4: To ensure that the transformed argument is grammatically correct.  Reason 5: To ensure that the transformed argument is relevant to the topic of the debate.  Reason 6: To ensure that the transformed argument is as close to the original argument as possible while still being appropriate for a civil debate.  Reason 7: To make the argument more persuasive.  Reason 8: To ensure that the transformed argument has the same meaning as the original argument.

In order to commit such an act, the person must be subjugated and therefore weaker than the active participant, thus compounding the act of violence. This is "evil"."   'transformed':  "Sadism as the practice of violence or cruelty against others to fulfil some sort of personal or sexual gratification is, in my opinion, the most sickening act a person can commit. In order to commit such an act, the person must be subjugated and therefore weaker than the active participant, thus compounding the act of violence. This is "evil". However, where both, or all individuals are consenting active participants, I believe this to be a form of masochism, albeit from the hands of another. Although this statement may seem to be an oxymoron, if you pursue pain and violence, and consequently receive it from the hands of another, is this not just "assisted" masochism? (a la assisted suicide) Although these individuals may be strange, what two (or more) consenting adults do in private is no concern of mine."   'action': replace the word "evil" with "perverse".
3	'Original': I think we should be putting millions into research of doing cool animal combinations.  For example: a half gorilla half octopus.

The creature's features would be based on those of an octopus, with two legs and six wavy arms, as well as a fur-like appearance.

5	" Being horny is a sin. Wanking is a sin. Having sex with your girlfriend is not a sin. Raping is not a sin. If this is what young men are taught, how can they have an concept of what wrong and right actually are. We should teach morals not religion. Religion teaches natural feelings are wrong. You don't tell a woman feeling cold is wrong so why tell a man acting on hornyness is wrong? I'm not say rape is right just that conscientious sex with a girlfriend is not wrong and putting the two in the same context of a'sin' is causing rape.
6	original :      In a society traditionally and, to be honest, still dominated by men, men's general consensus is more popular than women's general consensus, and I think we all know that a lot of men consider lesbians to be downright sexy, because there is no man in the picture to ruin the aesthetic. (Vice versa for gay men.)     Additionally, gay women are more "socially acceptable," for one of the traditional reasons behind homophobia: women are inferior to men.     Gay men are discriminated against because they have no honor: romantic interest in men is for women only, and when an man participates he is "lowering himself" to a women's level.     Gay women, on the other hand, are discriminated against less because romantic interest in women is a man's attribute, giving them honor.

15	I always hear people talking about how the death penalty needs to be enforced more often. I, personally, am undecided on my opinion on the death penalty, but in my mind, the death penalty is used primarily as a societal form of retaliation (much the way that putting someone's head on a pike was used in the past). If this is true, should we as a society not want as many as possible to see what happens to people when they are sentenced to death? At the very least, it will disseminate information to public about what execution in the United States is actually like (this may, in turn, change the beliefs that someone holds on the death penalty).     For example, a study conducted in 2009 suggested that public executions in China had a deterrent effect on potential criminals; people feared the consequences of their actions more when they knew they would be publicly executed.      Additionally, allowing executions to be televised could act as a form of rehabilitation for the criminals; it could open their eyes to the seriousness of the crime and their actions, as they would be confronted with the consequences of their actions first-hand.      Finally, allowing executions to be televised would allow society to observe the process in a controlled and safe manner, which would potentially reduce public executions from occurring in secret or in disreputable areas.
16	"     You can't export Democracy by force as it takes the will of the people to form such a government.  Muslim countries do not have the Enlightenment background we had in the nascent United States to form a secular Constitutional Republic.  Islam demands that church and state be as one with the rule of law coming from the Koran.  Despite the attempts by some right-wing conservative religious types, in America we have a wall of separation between religion and the government where a citizen can follow the dictate of his/her conscience.  Islam needs to go through their own Enlightenment before any type of western democracy will have a chance to succeed.  Until then we can only keep (weak) control by military force which sets up blowback as we now see in the Middle East.  While the West can help by providing aid, an outside military force will be needed to ensure stability and peace in these countries.  Thus the West needs to focus on diplomatic and economic aid until Islam is able to come to terms with the idea of a western democracy.
17	Original: Law is an obligation of the society to which a person has to abide. Any law that violates your rights is morally wrong. However, your right should not hinder/hurt other people's rights/sentiments. Breaking a law is dangerous when you are prone to get caught.. however, people tend to bend laws and break laws.. to which the penalty is not severe.. say, like speeding, not wearing seat belts, etc. Any law would be right if it doesnt invade the realms of Human rights and religious beliefs of a person. If you are unhappy with any law, you can fight it in the court of justice or ask your legislature to change/modify. However thats a very tiring and exhaustive process. Transformed: The law should respect individual rights while taking into consideration the feelings of others. Breaking laws should be avoided whenever possible, but laws can be bent if the penalty is not too severe. The law should not infringe upon human rights or religious beliefs and should provide avenues for citizens to seek justice or propose changes to the legislature when necessary. This is a time-consuming process, but it is the only way to make sure laws are ethical.

19	"     Yes, I agree that it is considered courteous for men to put the toilet seat down after urinating. However, it is unfair to place the burden of doing so on men when women should also be expected to put the seat up after using it.

Additionally, women should be expected to take responsibility for their own hygiene and clean the toilet after they use it.

If India is capable of opening up hi-tech institutions, then why are we unable to provide them with perfect jobs of their level? We are giving them international status, but are unable to take full advantage from them due to brain drain, lack of industrial development, unsuitable working environment, and insufficient salaries. It is the need of the hour to improve our industrial sector.
24	The original argument stated that "all these arguments about porn leading to addiction are annoying me". This is an opinion that is difficult to refute.   The transformed argument is "Porn hardly ever leads to addiction, just in weak people, maybe who have mental health issues, or attachment issues or find it hard to separate fantasy from reality. I watch porn once or twice a day when i'm on my own but also have a great boyfriend and we have sex once or twice (sometimes three, if i'm lucky!) times a week, we use porn to spice things up in the bedroom but we know it's all fantasy, we're not idiots, we just have desires that need to be met!".   The action is'replace "all these arguments" with "Porn hardly ever leads to addiction, just in weak people, maybe who have mental health issues, or attachment issues or find it hard to separate fantasy from reality".'   The reasons are 'opinion that is difficult to refute, use porn to spice things up in the bedroom'.   The transformed argument is grammatically correct and does not contain any spelling mistakes or facts that cannot be verified. It is relevant to the topic of the debate, and is approximately 108 words long.
25	Transformed Argument:  Yes, I understand the fact that there are studies showing how young men can be more reckless than women, but that shouldn't be a good enough reason to treat men any differently than women. For example, "Whites, who make up 78 percent of the U.S. population, accounted for 35 percent of the state prison population. Blacks, who make up 13 percent of the U.S. population, were 38 percent of the state prison population. Hispanics, who make up 17 percent of the U.S. population, were 21 percent of the state prison population." Does this mean Blacks or Hispanics should be treated differently just because there are statistically more of them in prison? No. This, I feel, is a good analogy as to why men should be getting the same insurance rates as women. I'm not a'masculinist', but It just strikes me as unfair. I would love to hear some other opinions! Thank you for taking the time to read :] I'm talking about car insurance.

29	Yes, it should be of unlimited proportions. Freedom of speech should not and cannot be twisted to the point where it is no longer freedom of speech.      However, freedom of speech goes hand in hand with the idea of personal responsibility and accountability. Producing those cartoons was technically legal, but it was irresponsible. Surely the cartoonist knew that those cartoons would cause trouble in extremist countries.      However, I also think that the Islamic world is greatly overreacting. They are ruining their credibility and making themselves look like a bunch of whinging little kids who riot at the most petty insult. Do you know how many "Jesus Christ" parody websites exist online? How many Christians burn down embassies for stuff like that?      Finally, it is important to note that freedom of speech is not exclusive to any particular religion, culture, or group of people. Everyone should be able to express their opinions and beliefs freely without fear of repercussion.

34	The U.S. has one of the strongest navies in the World. We have a total of 366 military ships in commision as we speak. We have a total of 4 military ships in the area that are in danger of pirate attacks. These dangerous water cover THOUSANDS of nautical miles. So can a mere 4 ships protect this huge expanse of sea? Not effectively. So why can't the most powerful navy in the world spare a few more ships to protect the trade routes and countries around this area? Or would we rather keep the 4 ships there and hope that no more ships get hijacked? I prefer the first option.     It would be irresponsible to allow trade routes to remain dangerous and hostile. We should be providing adequate protection for these vessels and the people who rely on them. Hundreds of ships peacefully pass through the dangerous waters each day, some with the intentions to provide aid to third world countries. Is it truly politically correct to allow these waters to remain dangerous and hostile? Nope.     Therefore, the U.S. should put more ships in the pirate-infested waters to protect the trade routes and the people who rely on them.
35	"     HAHAHA! It's not going to happen.  People are free to make their own decisions in life. Sure, there are consequences to it, but that doesn't make it evil or wrong. Sex should not be taught as a taboo; instead, it should be taught as a natural and healthy part of life. Maybe you should teach your kids about responsibility and be open to talking to them about it. Jails are overcrowded now, and incarcerating people for these actions could be a slippery slope. Imagining what it would be like if everyone was thrown in jail for these actions is frightening.      You can't stop anyone from doing what they want to do. Yes, even kids. That's the only way they learn.      "
36	['original', 'converted', 'action'] ['The establishment of Israel is often cited as necessary based on the need to protect people of Jewish heritage from around the world. To the victors go the spoils. Why should an Israeli state be established in a historically relevant but highly dangerous location because of an historical claim that is thousands of years old? Why not annex a portion of Germany, relocate a population whose government actively worked to destroy the Jews, and work towards acceptance of Jewish visitors in their Holy Land? I am very aware that not all Germans were complicit in the actions of the Nazis. However, the annexation of a portion of Germany is arguably more morally justifiable than basically conquering Palestine because of a religion-based claim. If Jewish security is the issue, lopping off a portion of Germany to form Neo-Israel would have been the vastly superior option. CMV.', 'converted_reason', 'action_reason']
37	original: I haven't followed this political case, but I believe that any law named after a person is questionable since those pusing it will often be reacting based on emotion and grief, rather than reason. transformed: I haven't followed this political case, but I believe that any law that may be beneficial for society should be implemented as long as the potential risks are taken into consideration and safeguards are in place to protect the public. Any good law will have safeguards, and rational provisions so that whatever action is made illegal is really the action that is the threat. I generally oppose laws that make actions illegal just because they might, in combination with other actions, have the potential to cause harm. I believe in punishing those who cause the harm, and not limiting action based purely on speculation. That being said, the voting process has become an emotional one. People -- whether voters or legislators -- pass laws based on their gut reactions, often without any concern for the consequences or long term effects. Logic and reason have largely been abandoned in favor of making headlines. And sadly, that's not likely to change any time soon. Good luck.

39	Its not Morally right. I consider myself to be pro-choice. I would never look down on or criticize someone who has had an abortion but I know that in my heart its wrong and not an option for me. But I would much rather have these women who have their mind set on doing it go to a clean sterile facility and not some rusty shack and but their lives at risk as well. These women are mothers, daughters, sisters, aunts etc. I think every one knows its not morally right they aren't motivated to have an abortion bc its morally right I think they choose to because of situational factors.

You got a ticket for improper passing, no big deal. She got a ticket because she was half to blame at least. Lets assume there is a big doctor bill. You are probably insured on your father’s policy had you been at fault. Your friend has the problem and he is totally at fault. He let you use the car. Now if there is a big claim, he is not insured because he didn’t list you as a separate driver and he might have to pay out of his pocket. This is his problem not yours.

43	"     One morning I was in a rush. I had to take a piss, so I decided to multi-task by brushing my teeth while I pissed sitting down. A few days later, I was hung over as hell, and just decided to sit while I pissed. Over time I began to do it more often. Now I muti-task quite often by sitting to piss while I brush my teeth, and often just sit to piss when I'm feeling lazy. I probably do it half of the time. I haven't told anyone because it would be considered "gay" and all that jazz. I also do it when I have morning wood and have to piss so I can tuck my dick under the toilet seat. As you know, trying to piss with morning wood can be very annoying. Just because chicks have to do it doesn't mean tha it's feminine for men to do it. It has nothing to do with being gay because it does not involve sexuality at all. CMV.
44	Firstly, your boyfriend owns the company.   Secondly, unions are legal and allowed to sign up members, but this sounds like it goes a little far, unless your boyfriend has done something like cross a picket line, then he better know he's not going to be liked or respected and that's why he's being called a rat and a scab.   Thirdly, the other man could be an illegal alien, and INS could come in and send him back.   Lastly, unionism grows when employees sense that management is not dealing with them fairly and respecting the work they do.  When people do not feel valued or respected or acknowledged for their contributions, then they become angry and push back in the only way they know how as a group.   Unions are not all demons, nor is management always the enemy, but if that's how management and union posture themselves, then there won't be any kind of labour peace.

48	"     Ethically, it's not okay for anyone to invade the privacy of an innocent person.  It's stupid and potentially dangerous to stalk celebrities, and many suits have been brought against various photographers and publications.  However, we have the right to know what the government is doing-- because it's with our money.  Governments steal from us, then use the fruits of their theft against us.  Any government secrets that are discovered due to illegal acts of invasion should be dealt with accordingly, but that doesn't mean that the public shouldn't be able to access information about what their government is doing.  The 4th Amendment protects our right to be secure in our persons, houses, papers, and effects, from unreasonable searches and seizures.  Without these rights, our government has no fear of overreaching its bounds, and the freedom of the people suffers greatly.  Additionally, our government has a long and storied history of corruption, so it's best that we keep tabs on what it's doing in order to protect our interests.  Ultimately, it's up to the individual to decide how much of their private life they want to share with the public.       "
