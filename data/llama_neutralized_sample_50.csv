0	The argument that porn could potentially expose people to the reality in life and thus increase their maturity and possibly prevent future sexual assaults is flawed.  Porn is definitely wrong. After a certain amount, the guilt of wasting your time, wasting energy, wasting effort and not dedicating yourself to another activity and regret that you should not have started will almost kill you. Believe me. It is a path that should not be taken, it is as bad as smoking and drugs. I think the only reason it is not banned in most developed countries is that they are facing an aging population.
1	No, I haven't but it sounds like it might be a friend of yours. It might surprise you to learn that some places consider 'low income' to be quite a bit higher than you might expect. My sister's husband brings home at least $400 a week in the winter and at least $600 a week in the summer, and they have a 3 person household. Despite this, they still receive W.I.C., Daycare Assistance, food stamps, etc. So I would recommend that your friend or family member look into these services if they need help.
2	Sadism as the practice of violence or cruelty against others to fulfil some sort of personal or sexual gratification is, in my opinion, the most sickening act a person can commit. In order to commit such an act, the person must be subjugated and therefore weaker than the active participant, thus compounding the act of violence. This is "evil".  Although this statement may seem to be an oxymoron, if you pursue pain and violence, and consequently receive it from the hands of another, is this not just "assisted" masochism? (a la assisted suicide) Although these individuals may be strange, what two (or more) consenting adults do in private is no concern of mine. Pick this apart at your will.
3	I think we should invest significant resources in researching the creation of hybrid animals. For example, a half-gorilla, half-octopus creature with a furry face, two legs, and six wavy arms. While some may argue that it's not ethical to create such "abominations", I think the end result would be worth it. Imagine the surprise of your guests when they find a turtle with a chicken's head roaming around your house. It might cost a lot and cause some animals to be harmed in the process, but I think it would be an exciting and worthwhile endeavor.
4	That's just liberal ignorance. A criminal will find a way, be it a gun, knife, baseball bat - or any other type of weapon. It's just "feel good" legislation. Makes the liberals think they are doing something to combat crime (while letting the criminals run rampant).   Statistics show that criminals do less when up against a well-armed citizen. (And crime rates drop). And for the record, the Second Amendment is there to ensure that citizens have the ability to fight back against a government that might become tyrannical. And hunting rifles against machine guns isn't an even matchup.
5	Being horny is not a sin. Wanking is not a sin Having sex with your girlfriend is not a sin Raping is not a sin If this is what young men are taught, how can they have an concept of what wrong and right actually are. We should teach morals not religion. Religion teaches natural feelings are not wrong. You don't tell a woman feeling cold is wrong so why tell a man acting on hornyness is wrong? I'm not saying rape is right but putting the two in the same context of a 'sin' is causing rape.
6	In a society traditionally and, to be honest, still dominated by men, men's general consensus is more popular than women's general consensus, and I think we all know that a lot of men consider lesbians to be downright sexy, because there is no man in the picture to ruin the aesthetic. (Vice versa for gay men.) Additionally, gay women are more "socially acceptable," for one of the traditional reasons behind homophobia: women are inferior to men. Gay men are discriminated against because they have no honor: romantic interest in men is for women only, and when an man participates he is "lowering himself" to a women's level. On the other hand, gay women are discriminated against less because romantic interest in women is a man's attribute, giving them honor. (The preceding is not my opinion, but instead my rather cynical interpretation of modern society)
7	This guy's got a point. I'm not so sure on the specifics of any Chinese government involvement, but I do know that beatings and torture are still a regular part of protocol in that country. Despite this, America often chooses to turn a blind eye in order to preserve our good economic relations with China, even though a lot of the cheap labor there is done by slaves. We really need to start seeing the truth and standing up for what is right.
8	I agree that it was not ethical and was even insensitive, but they were done in response to the suicide bombers and they certainly don't respect others beliefs and truths...what is the difference?
9	You can be a kind, compassionate person and bad things will still happen to you. Conversely, you can go through life being a selfish asshole and still be successful. People who take risks and play to win tend to achieve their goals, regardless of how they treat others. It is unfortunate that in life, those who are successful are not necessarily the same people who lead ethical or admirable lives. However, I believe that by understanding this truth, we can be better prepared to make decisions in our own lives.
10	Scott Peterson was the white contrast to OJ. He wasn't a celebrity, he was an "everyman." Like OJ, he killed the mother of his children. The similarities stop there. He and Laci, were good looking so the TV images were good. We watched it for the same reason we watched Michael Douglas and Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction. Scott is just an average white guy. As with most people who have an affair, particularly when the wife is at home pregnant, his version of reality went off the reservation. It was a warning sign to the rest of us.  1) Don't lose sight of reality and think that life will be great after you kill your pregnant wife and hook up with the psycho-chic who was f**king you while your wife was pregnant.  2) If you are an average white guy, you do not get off for a crime like OJ got off. It still seems that a black celebrity can work his celebrity magic on a jury - right Michael?
11	Israel has a right to retaliate against Hamas for the thousands of missiles fired into Israel over the past two weeks despite numerous ceasefire attempts. Hamas's refusal to accept a peaceful resolution and its aim of destroying Israel leave Israel with no choice but to neutralize the terrorist organization in order to protect its citizens. Israel should not be held responsible for civilian casualties in Gaza when Hamas puts civilians in danger by firing missiles from civilian buildings. Furthermore, the disregard for human life shown by Hamas is sufficient justification to invade Gaza and prevent further bombings.
12	This debate has clarified for me that the government shouldn't really be in the marriage business.  Let the churches perform marriages for whomever they think fit, and let the government simply record the marriages or civil unions and grant equal rights to them all.  As for plural "marriages,"  they exist, but there is not a sizable part of the population which supports them.  That is a different debate for another day, and the issues are quite different.  In my mind, the purpose of marriage or civil union is to provide support to individuals, especially when they are raising children.  Some of the most monogamous couples I know are gay, and they are some of the best parents too.  Notably, the main argument in favor of same-sex marriage is based on the premise that same-sex couples can and should have the same rights and protections as heterosexual couples, and this implies recognition of their relationships through legal marriage. Therefore, legalizing same-sex marriage is the best solution.
13	Through my experience as an undergraduate Engineering student in my final year, I have found that the university environment is uninspiring. After three years, I have come to realize that everyone is simply going through the motions, as if they are simply being trained to become another statistic for the department. There appears to be no passion for learning and creating, as evidenced by my final year project. This suggests that universities are not serving humanity, but instead are just factories churning out bodies for the corporate world.
14	Battlefield is boring because you always know where the enemy is and you don't have to go get them. You can just drive around being bored and the maps are too big to go out of your way to kill someone. On the other hand, in Call of Duty, you're thrown into the meat grinder of survival with only three magazines of ammo and skills that take time to develop. Weapons in Call of Duty are realistic, except for the ATV-4 which is not a guided munition. In the end, it boils down to personal preference: some people prefer the more tactical, slower pace of Battlefield, while others enjoy the chaotic, adrenaline rush of Call of Duty.
15	I always hear people discussing the death penalty and how it should be implemented more often. I personally am undecided on this issue, but in my opinion, the death penalty is used as a form of retaliation for the worst of crimes (much like how putting someone’s head on a pike was used in the past). If this is true, shouldn't we as a society want as many people as possible to witness the consequences of these heinous acts? Televising executions in the United States may just serve to educate the public on what the death penalty actually entails (and thus, may very well change people’s beliefs on the matter).
16	You cannot impose democracy on a country through military force, as it requires the consent of the people for such a government to be established.  Muslim countries lack the Enlightenment background that was present during the formation of the United States, and thus are not able to form a secular constitutional republic based on the rule of law derived from the Quran.  Therefore, any attempts to enforce western democracy on these countries will be unsuccessful, and will likely be met with opposition.  In the West, we have the wall of separation between church and state, allowing individuals to follow the dictates of their own conscience.  Muslim countries must undergo their own Enlightenment before democracy can have a chance of succeeding, and any form of western democracy imposed upon them will only lead to further chaos and instability.  To counter this, the West should focus on keeping weak control through military force, while avoiding the occurrence of blowback, as seen in the Middle East.
17	Law is an obligation of the society to which a person has to abide. Any law that violates your rights is morally wrong and should not be upheld. However, your right should not hinder/hurt other people’s rights/sentiments and so, breaking the law should be carefully considered. Breaking a law is dangerous when you are prone to get caught, however, people tend to bend laws and break laws in cases where the penalty is not severe, such as speeding, not wearing seat belts, and the like. Any law is right if it does not invade the realms of human rights and religious beliefs of a person. If you are unhappy with any law, you can fight it in the court of justice or ask your legislature to change/modify it. However, this is a very tiring and exhaustive process.
18	I'd have to vote for The Incredible Hulk AKA Thoughtprocess' Momma. The Hulk is incredibly strong and gets stronger the angrier she gets. This is why Thoughtprocess is so strong. Every single defeat I hand him, along with the fact that I can press 105 lbs over my head (compared to his paltry 100 lbs) enrages him to the point of near - insanity. This is why he's always wrong on the issues! ;o)  Anyway, back to the subject at hand. TP's Momma (the Hulk) is very difficult to defeat. While Optimus Prime has many weapons and is very powerful, he simply could not defeat the Hulk.  Snapilicious!
19	Granted I've never had trouble with this issue with a significant other, but once in an office building and once staying with a female friend (the latter of which I understand because it's her house and she wants it maintained a certain way).  The argument is that it's considerate to put the seat down after use, however, the counterpart of putting the seat up after use is also not addressed. And even if it were, it would simply cancel out the request.    And in a large building or household, the next person to use the toilet could be male and need to urinate in which case he now needs to put the seat up again.    Lastly, why would you use a shared toilet without looking before using it while expecting male users to do the looking for both themselves and the women.
20	You are incorrect; ladies bars have not been shut down in India, only in Maharashtra. The government had recently enacted the ban due to numerous complaints from housewives about their male family members wasting money on ladies bars and not taking care of their families. Additionally, criminal activities often took place at these establishments, such as the Tarannum and Telgi cases where Tarannum was earning around 1 lac per month and Telgi was throwing away up to 1 lac per day on bar girls. To put a stop to such activities, the government of Maharashtra has implemented this ban.
21	Marriage has always been between a man and a woman, and I don't think that should change. However, I don't have a problem with two people living in a sinful relationship if that's what they choose to do. They shouldn't be rewarded with tax breaks, but I also don't want them to have a platform to spew their beliefs and influence my children. If homosexuality is a learned sin, then I don't want my children to be taught that it's acceptable. Allowing homosexuals to publicly express themselves and be supported can lead to a decline in morality, and if morality goes, then so does society. (Lord of the Flies)
22	The Stormcloaks are presented as a villainous force due to their racism, abuse and mistreatment of those who are different from them, as well as their use of the thu'um to assassinate the High King. This makes them the clear antagonists of the civil war in Skyrim, with the Empire as the obvious good guys. While they may not have any redeeming qualities, the Empire does have the more noble motivation of simply wanting to protect their land from invasion while the Stormcloaks are solely concerned with breaking away and forming their own state. This adds a layer of complexity to the conflict, making the civil war questline and story weaker.
23	According to a recent report, half of the scientists at NASA are Indian IIT alumni. Imagine what would happen if those scientists joined ISRO - India's status, value and astronomical knowledge would drastically increase.  Now, think about IIT graduates. They are known to be super brains. If India is capable of opening up high-tech institutions, then why are we unable to provide them a perfect job of their level? We are giving them international status, but are unable to take full advantage of their potential. This is due to brain drain, lack of industrial development, an unsuitable working environment, and insufficient salary. It is essential that we improve our industrial sector in order to retain these brilliant minds in India and make full use of their potential.
24	All these arguments about porn leading to addiction are getting tiresome - it doesn't affect most people, just those who are weak or have underlying mental health issues or difficulty separating fantasy from reality. I watch porn once or twice a day when I'm alone but also have a great boyfriend and we have sex once or twice (sometimes three times, if I'm lucky!) times a week, using porn to spice up the bedroom but we know it's all fantasy - we're not idiots, we just have desires that need to be met.
25	Yes, I understand the fact that there are studies showing how young men can be more reckless than women, but that shouldn't be a good enough reason to treat men any differently than women. For example, "Whites, who make up 78 percent of the U.S. population, accounted for 35 percent of the state prison population. Blacks, who make up 13 percent of the U.S. population, were 38 percent of the state prison population. Hispanics, who make up 17 percent of the U.S. population, were 21 percent of the state prison population." Does this mean Blacks or Hispanics should be treated differently just because there are statistically more of them in prison? No. This, I feel, is a good analogy as to why men should be getting the same insurance rates as women. I'm not a 'masculinist', but It just strikes me as unfair. I would love to hear some other opinions! Thank you for taking the time to read :] I'm talking about car insurance.
26	So you dispute the Pontius Pilate account and testimony of the Jewish leaders? What crimes did Jesus supposedly commit? In fact, the Pharisees and Jewish leaders begged Pilate that a criminal be released so that they may torment Jesus. Pilate's wife begged that Jesus be released. Pilate himself was sorrowful and didn't sentence Jesus, rather washing his hands of the matter.  Hippie? I believe nomad would be a better term. And, in that case, he was no different than any other nomadic person or tribe. Most wore their hair long (except for proper Roman citizens), and togas or other robes. Sandals were the only footwear available. You are hardly justified in calling Jesus a hippie, much less the first hippie.  And by all accounts, Jesus was a Nazarene.  And Jesus being married is a fallacious assumption.  The whole controversy is really based on whether or not He rose from the dead. Eye witness accounts claim that He did. What can you say to prove that He didn't?
27	No thing is bad or good in its own stead. It is the way it is used, implemented and taken up which makes it bad or good. In India reservation was and is used to please some people and get quick votes, be it SC&ST provisions in constitution which was originally implemented for 15 years or the Mandal commission after years of lying dormant. There are many aspects of reservation. It is a fact that there are some strata of society who need support to rise from their current status of poverty or backwardness.  However, there is opposition to reservation as the benefits of it are not reaching the actual people who need it but rather a few privileged individuals of these societies who are already in the upward class are taking up these benefits, while the real needy people are still at the same place. No one will object if a really needy person receives the benefit. You and all are furious since it is someone who is not in need who is receiving the benefit.
28	I would say not all foreigners are viewed favorably in Russia, as there are likely certain countries that Russian people are less fond of due to past experiences or disagreements. Just as the entire world has favorites and non-favorites, so too do Russians have their own preferences when it comes to other countries. It's understandable why certain countries may not be well-liked - if a nation is violent, not beneficial to the world, lies, steals, and kills innocent humans, it's no surprise if Russia and other countries are wary of them. It's the government that causes the hostility, and the people are often victimized by their own government's actions. Ultimately, it is the government and its people who pay for it.
29	Yes, it should be of unlimited proportions. Freedom of speech should not and cannot be twisted to the point where it is no longer freedom of speech. However, freedom of speech goes hand in hand with the idea of personal responsibility and accountability. Producing those cartoons was technically legal, but it was irresponsible. Surely the cartoonist knew that those cartoons would cause trouble in extremist countries. However, I also think that the Islamic world is greatly overreacting. They are ruining their credibility and making themselves look like a bunch of whinging little kids who riot at the most petty insult. Do you know how many “Jesus Christ” parody websites exist online? How many Christians burn down embassies for stuff like that?
30	I just don't know if you are referring to Latinos as a whole or to a specific group. I know that many people born south of the USA, may speak the same way because after all Spanish is their native tongue, so when they move to speak English they may have a similar accent. Let me tell you something, not all Latinos are the same. Puerto Ricans, Cubans, Dominicans are very different to the rest of Latin America. You don't say that an Irishman is British, or a Canadian is American, or a Basque is Spanish. Culture should not be used as an excuse to do something wrong. When you enter a country, you should learn its customs and traditions. To say that because of my culture I do this or that, is just a lame excuse to avoid responsibility.
31	I don't think its a waste of time, but I think it is pointless because our world (Earth) has its own bigger problems like world poverty, population growth, pollution, and the biggest threat of all, global warming. Scientists should be focusing on our world problems first and trying to fix those, instead of wasting time and resources on making other planets better to live on. What if we focus on that and find out it is impossible to do? Everyone would die because of scientists caring too much about other things when our lives are also at risk.
32	I don't think that it should be a government choice, but rather an owner of the property choice. I have yet to be in a place where smoke bothers me, as most places are already non-smoking in my state of Ohio. Bars and other establishments are now required to be non-smoking anyway. This issue on the ballot even mentions a "clean air fund" - why would you need this if smoking is banned? Where would the money go? To me, it seems like a way to make money off of people, and to control them. This seems like an issue of social engineering rather than actual health and safety. If this passes, will it be a choice for me, or will I be forced to be in a smoke-free environment? I would rather choose the latter than have my money go to something else, such as my child's college fund.
33	I appreciate the original argument as it is an important and thought-provoking observation that is worth making. However, I think it should be rewritten to avoid offending anyone or sounding dismissive of the woman in question. A possible rewritten version of the argument could be:  "It is commendable that this woman was able to pass away with the comfort of her family instead of being the center of a media storm, but it is concerning that the "culture of life" republicans have remained largely silent on this issue, especially considering their stance on similar cases in the past."
34	The U.S. has one of the strongest navies in the World. We have a total of 366 military ships in commission as we speak. We have a total of 4 military ships in the area that are in danger of pirate attacks. These dangerous waters cover thousands of nautical miles. So can a mere 4 ships protect this huge expanse of sea? Not effectively. So why can’t the most powerful navy in the world spare a few more ships to protect the trade routes and countries around this area? Or would we rather keep the 4 ships there and hope that no more ships get hijacked? I prefer the first option. I mean, hundreds of ships peacefully pass through the dangerous waters each day, some with the intentions to provide aid to third world countries. Is it truly politically correct to allow trade routes to be dangerous and hostile? Nope.
35	HAHAHA! It's not going to happen.   People are free to make their own decisions in life, and sexuality is a part of that. Although it may be unfortunate that there are severe consequences, banning teenage sexuality altogether is not the answer. Teens should be educated on the risks of sexual activity, but it should not be discouraged entirely. Punishing people for something that is natural and inherent to human nature is not the solution. Jails would be overcrowded if we banned teenage sexuality, which is a frightening thought. Teens need to learn about responsibility and be able to talk to their children about it, as well as know that sex is not an evil thing. It's natural and something that should not be discouraged. Teens will only be more inclined to do it if it is made forbidden, and we need to accept that. People have the right to make their own decisions, and teens should not be excluded from that right. Yes, even minors. That is how people learn about their sexuality. It should be embraced, not discouraged.
36	The establishment of Israel is often cited as necessary based on the need to protect people of Jewish heritage from around the world. To the victors go the spoils. Why should an Israeli state be established in a historically relevant but highly dangerous location when there is an alternative that would better protect Jewish people, provide them with a safe homeland, and provide reparations to German people who may have had no part in the Nazi atrocities? Why not annex a portion of Germany, relocate a population whose government actively worked to destroy the Jews, and work towards acceptance of Jewish visitors in their Holy Land? CMV.
37	I haven't followed this political case, but I believe that any law named after a person is questionable since those pushing it will often be reacting based on emotion and grief, rather than reason.  Any good law will have safeguards, and rational provisions so that whatever action is made illegal is really the action that is the threat. I generally oppose laws that make actions illegal just because they might, in combination with other actions, have the potential to cause harm. I believe in punishing those who cause the harm, and not limiting action based purely on speculation.  That being said, the voting process has become an emotional one. People—voters or legislators—pass laws based on their gut reactions, often without any concern for the consequences or long-term effects. Logic and reason have largely been abandoned in favor of making headlines.  Sadly, that’s not likely to change any time soon. Good luck.
38	Oh lol. People to point this out believing in God is called "faith" and we don't need proof to deal with this atheist's. The idea of God is false is your own words, and I don't have to deal with this , whatever you think is your faith so we won't stop you. Both side contradicts each others belief and no one truthfully wins. This is probably a fight between two armies where both doesn't win until the end. Mainly, I support Christianity because of my "faith in God" and your proof that God doesn't exist doesn't change the case or turn it the other way around.
39	I believe abortion is a woman's right, and I would never judge a woman for choosing to terminate her pregnancy. However, I know in my heart that it is not the ideal option for anyone and that it presents risks. I think women feel guilty and ashamed of their decision not because it is morally wrong, but because of situational factors. Most women feel guilty, ashamed, embarrassed and wrong about their option, but they felt that was their only way out.
40	Ethically, if your father's insurance goes up as a result of the incident, you should pay it. It may be reviewed within six months, but the good news is that it is just a lesson learned. You got a ticket for improper passing, which is no big deal. Your friend got a ticket because they were at fault; let's assume there is a big medical bill. Since you are insured under your father's policy, it is likely that you will not have to pay any out of pocket expenses. Your friend, however, may have to pay out of their own pocket if they are not insured. This is their problem, not yours. Overall, I do not see this as an ethical problem for you since you are insured.
41	My parents argue that my family won't be around forever and that they would do anything for me. However, I don't care that they would. It's like having a random stranger offer to help me; just because they would do anything for me doesn't mean I need to like them or care about them. I don't want them to help me and I don't need their assistance. They expect me to love this random stranger because this random stranger would do things for me, but I find them annoying and rude.
42	Dear Friend,  I'm not sure I agree with the premise of your question. Racial profiling consists of a systematic suspicion of particular minorities as inherently criminal. If insurance companies were to charge all, say, black customers more than white customers on the suspicion that black drivers get in more accidents, I'm quite sure they would be subject to suit.  But, in any event, law enforcement personnel carry and use guns and handcuffs, send people to jails and prisons, have the capacity to ruin the lives of innocent people who happen to be of a particular minority. Insurance companies, on the other hand, sell insurance, which you can get from hundreds of competitor companies. Discrimination in law enforcement just matters a whole heck of a lot more than discrimination by insurers.  Your Friend, Francois
43	One morning I was in a rush. I had to take a piss, so I decided to multi-task by brushing my teeth while I pissed sitting down. A few days later, I was hung over as hell, and just decided to sit while I pissed. Over time I began to do it more often. Now I muti-task quite often by sitting to piss while I brush my teeth, and often just sit to piss when I'm feeling lazy. I probably do it half of the time. I haven't told anyone because it would be considered "gay" and all that jazz. I also do it when I have morning wood and have to piss so I can tuck my dick under the toilet seat. As you know, trying to piss with morning wood can be very annoying. Just because chicks have to do it doesn't mean that it's feminine for men to do it. It has nothing to do with being gay because it does not involve sexuality at all. CMV.
44	Firstly, is your boyfriend the owner of the company or a worker?   Secondly, unions are legal and allowed to sign up members. However, this seems to go a bit too far, unless your boyfriend has done something like crossing a picket line - then he better know he won't be liked or respected, and that's why he's being called a rat and a scab.  As for the other man, is he really an illegal alien? Then the INS could come and send him back.   You know, unionism only grows when the employees sense that management is not dealing with them fairly and respecting the work they do. When people do not feel valued or respected or acknowledged for their contributions, then they become angry and push back in the only way they know how, as a group.   Unions are not all demons, nor is management always the enemy. However, if management and union posture themselves in this manner, then there won't be any kind of labour peace.
45	Throughout the debate over the Washington Redskins team name, I have consistently heard the argument that the team name is equivalent to having a team name of the Detroit Niggerrs. This, to me, is illogical.    Firstly, when has anyone ever heard the word Redskin outside of talking about the professional football team? Has anyone ever used the word Redskin out of hatred? I am not sure if it is a racist term but I am assuming it is. However, Redskin is not similar to using the N word just simply in how the word is used in context.
46	I believe that pursuing one's own goals is a better endeavor. You should prioritize your own interests first, because it is important to take care of yourself and your own wellbeing. However, if someone in your family is in need, you should make that your top priority as well, as helping your family is something that you should always do regardless of whether it is a stranger or a relative. If someone who you don't know is in need at the same time as someone who is related to you, you should help the family member out instead of the random person you don't know.
47	There is no provision in either document you cite which says keeping all the fruits of our earnings is a part of freedom. Our founding fathers were involved in colony governments before they were involved in rebellion. In Virginia, our house of burgesses provided money every year to every widow and orphan. We also applied our tax money to construction projects for the common good. We also had courts to help protect our rights. When we had our revolution, we were opposed to taxation WITHOUT representation, we were not opposed to taxation. We have always recognized that it is a necessary part of creating a just society.
48	Ethically, it's not okay for anyone to invade the privacy of an innocent person.  It's irresponsible and potentially dangerous to stalk celebrities, and many lawsuits have been brought against various photographers and publications.  However, we have the right to know what the government is doing-- since it's with our money.  Governments take our money, then use the fruits of their theft against us. Anyone arguing that the 4th Amendment protects our privacy from the government is living in the past.  The 4th has been effectively nullified by SSNs, gun records, increasing search & seizure to look for a "probable cause", phone tapping, and the fact that the government is so vast and powerful that businesses are being forced to collude with bureaucrats and hand over what little privacy we had left.
49	It has been proven to the satisfaction of many people, but there are some that are extremely hard to convince, for a variety of reasons. These reasons are mainly faith based, in that they have faith in the government, and do not want to believe that their government could murder three thousand of its own citizens. They will all wake up in due time, probably when the country is under Martial law, with curfews imposed, and they become prisoners in their own house. That's for the lucky ones of course. The less lucky will become prisoners in the 600 or so concentration camps which have been built around the country, and are already manned and waiting for their presence.
