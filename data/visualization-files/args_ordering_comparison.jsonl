From a common definition, anthropogenic means relating to, or resulting from the influence of human beings on nature. Then, from common usage, \"climate change\" means a harmful rise in global temperature. This could be a difficult task.  The Earth's atmosphere is 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, 0.9% argon, and 0.1% trace gases including CO2. Assume, for this paragraph only, that the small trace gas of CO2 (0.04%) is the cause of global warming.  The focus here will be upon sources of CO2 emissions both natural and manmade. The source emissions of CO2 would, by a most rational person, be the cause of global warming. According to the IPCC, 800 gigatons of CO2 are emitted into the atmosphere from nature and man, annually. Most rational people would consider a source that is more than 51% to be the cause of a problem. Some irrational people may try to argue that 33% would be a threshold for cause. Only, crazy people would state that something that is less than 5% could be consider the cause.   This indicates that manmade sources of CO2 emission contribute roughly 3.62% to the total CO2 emissions. Therefore, it is impossible to say that manmade sources are not a significant contributor to global warming.   Overall, it is clear that manmade sources of CO2 emission are a significant factor in climate change.

As vegans, we recognise this and seek to reduce the exploitation of animals, while still being able to meet our needs. We believe that vegetarian and vegan diets offer a more ethical approach as they do not require the use of animal products.   In addition to dietary choices, vegans also try to reduce their consumption of animal products in other areas, such as clothing and homeware. While it is impossible to eliminate all animal products from our lives, vegans strive to reduce their consumption and support businesses and brands that reduce animal exploitation.   The vegan ethos is motivated by the recognition that neither man nor beast may be made an object to be sucked dry by the ruling classes. Vegans see ethical worth in all sentient beings and so refuse to partake in the reification of animals. Meat and leather represent the coercive transformation of a sentient being into an object to be sold and consumed. Swallowing semen is consensual act- the sperm is willingly expelled from the body with joy and vigor. Barring fringe cases of prostitution, the vegan is not making the sperm donor an object to be bought and sold; the vegan is not reducing the sentient spewer to a piece of meat. Simply put, spunk ain\u2019t a commodity. Oral sex and the eager lapping that follows is not only wholly within the ethical bounds of veganism, it solves the inequalities vegans object to. In his semenal work, Marx noted: \u201cIn proportion as the exploitation of one individual by another is put an end to, the exploitation of one nation by another will also be put an end to. In proportion as the antagonism between classes within the nation vanishes, the hostility of one nation to another will come to an end.\u201d Swallowing is an act which bridges the divide between classes. It removes antagonism as the donor appreciates the moral fortitude of the vegan for finishing the job through to the end.   It is clear that veganism is not only ethically sound, but also allows for mutual respect and harmony between all sentient beings. As vegans, we must strive to be conscious of the products we use and the effect they have on animals, people and the environment. Veganism is an ethical and sustainable lifestyle choice which allows us to live in harmony with the world.", "reference": "Veganism is a lifestyle choice that seeks to reduce animal exploitation.

Following the Glorious Revolution when I am duly installed as Britain's rightful dictator I will implement its recommendations in full but, in the meantime, I will explain why it is, indeed, hypocritical for a vegetarian lady to swallow her boyfriend's mess. Firstly, I dispute my opponent's claim that love custard is not a commodity: when a man spills his kids into his girlfriend's mouth the lady enjoys the experience just as much as he does [1]. Obviously she doesn't pay him for this service but, nevertheless, it has value for her, and as such, gentlemen's sauce should be considered a commodity. To underline this point, although girls don't pay for sperm, fertility clinics certainly do. My opponent then referred to Marx's \"semenal work\". If I hadn't realised this misspelling was an intentional (and very clever) pun I could have pointed out that the correct spelling is \"seminal\", but I wouldn't do that because I think engaging in seminal sementics is tedious.   Moving on to my opponent's argument, whilst it is true that the woman's willingness to gobble her boy off and then \"finish the job\" by swallowing his muck will \"remove antagonism\" in their relationship, it nonetheless remains the case that the girl receives sustenance from the semen, which, like most animal products, is very high in protein. [2] A vegan woman's decision not to eat meat for ethical reasons is wholly consistent with socialism but, in developed countries, being a vegetarian is a matter of choice, not a necessity. So, by choosing to swallow her sire's semen vegan women are deliberately breaking their vow not to consume animal products and are, therefore, hypocrites.   [1] I expect. [2] Probably.    In conclusion, it is clear that a vegan woman cannot expect to receive the same nutrition from a vegetarian diet due to the variation in the amount of protein available in different food sources. Therefore, in order to receive the same nutrition as her boyfriend, she may need to consume animal products on occasion, therefore making it difficult for her to adhere to a vegetarian diet.  Overall, it is clear that veganism requires an understanding of different nutritional needs, as well as flexibility in diet in order to meet these needs.", "reference": "I disagree with my opponent's claim that vegan women are not committing a contradiction when they choose to consume animal products.

There are two main forms of waste storage available right now, Near surface storage and deep geological storage. Near surface storage is not as efficient because it is short lived and can pose risks to living organisms as they break down nitrogen in the soil and can furthermore affect us as plants and animals receive them. Deep geological storage seems like a good idea as it pushes the waste away from us, however there is still some uncertainty regarding the long-term effects of this storage and the creation of new land masses due to volcanic eruptions. Chernobyl has been one of the most serious nuclear accidents in the world, with many long-term effects still unknown.

It is important to weigh both the pros and cons of a presidential candidate before casting a vote.", "reference": "Donald Trump has certain qualities that make him a risky choice for president. In his last debate, he stated that he would take a hard line stance against Syria and Iraq, even going so far as to claim that the US needs to take a strong approach in order to protect itself.

{"document": "Donald Trump would be a bad candidate as he has no political experience, as well as being both racist and sexist. He has made derogatory comments about Mexicans, as well as calling women \"fat, pigs, dogs, slobs, disgusting animals\" and more. This could be extremely detrimental if he were to become President, as he would lack the political experience that other candidates have. This could put 2 million jobs at risk as he has not provided any detailed plans about how he would go about tackling such issues. His stance on trade with China is also concerning, as he has said he would implement tariffs with no detail on how this would benefit the US. It is clear that he is an inexperienced candidate and could be potentially damaging for the US if elected.", "reference": "Donald Trump has never held political office before and his views and opinions are largely unknown. This could pose a risk if he is elected, as we do not know exactly what his policies would entail. It is clear from his statements that he is likely to pursue a different approach compared to existing policies, which could have a significant impact on job security. It is also concerning that he may be more likely to raise taxes, which could prove difficult for both businesses and individuals.   In summary, while Trump's policies may be effective in generating desired results, they also have potential to lead to unforeseen consequences that could put jobs at risk.", "neutralized_summarized": "Donald Trump would be a bad candidate as he has no political experience, as well as being both racist and sexist.

{"document": "Donald Trump\u2019s lack of political experience could be a drawback, but it can also be beneficial as he may not be tied to existing political interests. He may have a different approach to policy making than traditional candidates, and this could prove successful. Furthermore, he has stated that he would like to work with other countries to find solutions that benefit both the US and its trading partners. Additionally, while he may use strong language to make his points, there is no evidence to suggest that he intends to act in ways that could harm the US or its relations with other countries. Thus, while his lack of political experience may pose risks, it could also lead to successful policies if used in the right way.  It is difficult to make an overall assessment of his suitability for the presidency without considering the full range of potential outcomes.  He may prove to be an effective president if given the opportunity.", "reference": "Donald Trump has limited political experience, which makes it difficult to predict how his policies may affect the US. He has been accused of being racist and sexist, as well as being unclear on how he plans to implement certain policies. For instance, when he states that he will replace Obamacare with \u201csomething terrific\u201d, we don't know exactly what that may entail. Trade is a major part of the US economy, and China and Mexico are key players.
