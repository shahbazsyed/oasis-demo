The source emissions of CO2 would, by a most rational person, be the cause of global warming. According to the IPCC, 800 gigatons of CO2 are emitted into the atmosphere from nature and man, annually.

In modern society, the production of consumer goods is often driven by profits and market demands. This can lead to exploitation of animals, both in terms of the resources used to produce the goods, as well as the animals themselves who are used as a source of food or resources. As vegans, we recognise this and seek to reduce the exploitation of animals, while still being able to meet our needs. We believe that vegetarian and vegan diets offer a more ethical approach as they do not require the use of animal products.   In addition to dietary choices, vegans also try to reduce their consumption of animal products in other areas, such as clothing and homeware. While it is impossible to eliminate all animal products from our lives, vegans strive to reduce their consumption and support businesses and brands that reduce animal exploitation.   The vegan ethos is motivated by the recognition that neither man nor beast may be made an object to be sucked dry by the ruling classes. Vegans see ethical worth in all sentient beings and so refuse to partake in the reification of animals. Meat and leather represent the coercive transformation of a sentient being into an object to be sold and consumed. Swallowing semen is consensual act- the sperm is willingly expelled from the body with joy and vigor. Barring fringe cases of prostitution, the vegan is not making the sperm donor an object to be bought and sold; the vegan is not reducing the sentient spewer to a piece of meat. Simply put, spunk ain\u2019t a commodity. Oral sex and the eager lapping that follows is not only wholly within the ethical bounds of veganism, it solves the inequalities vegans object to. In his semenal work, Marx noted: \u201cIn proportion as the exploitation of one individual by another is put an end to, the exploitation of one nation by another will also be put an end to. In proportion as the antagonism between classes within the nation vanishes, the hostility of one nation to another will come to an end.\u201d Swallowing is an act which bridges the divide between classes. It removes antagonism as the donor appreciates the moral fortitude of the vegan for finishing the job through to the end.   It is clear that veganism is not only ethically sound, but also allows for mutual respect and harmony between all sentient beings. As vegans, we must strive to be conscious of the products we use and the effect they have on animals, people and the environment. Veganism is an ethical and sustainable lifestyle choice which allows us to live in harmony with the world.", "reference": "Veganism is the practice of abstaining from the use of animal products, particularly in diet, as well as following an associated philosophy that rejects the commodity status of sentient animals.

{"document": "I would like to thank Raisor for accepting this debate and for framing his response within the context of the Communist Manifesto which, as anybody with a social conscience will tell you, is the blueprint for a progressive and equitable meritocracy. Following the Glorious Revolution when I am duly installed as Britain's rightful dictator I will implement its recommendations in full but, in the meantime, I will explain why it is, indeed, hypocritical for a vegetarian lady to swallow her boyfriend's mess. Firstly, I dispute my opponent's claim that love custard is not a commodity: when a man spills his kids into his girlfriend's mouth the lady enjoys the experience just as much as he does [1]. Obviously she doesn't pay him for this service but, nevertheless, it has value for her, and as such, gentlemen's sauce should be considered a commodity. To underline this point, although girls don't pay for sperm, fertility clinics certainly do. My opponent then referred to Marx's \"semenal work\". If I hadn't realised this misspelling was an intentional (and very clever) pun I could have pointed out that the correct spelling is \"seminal\", but I wouldn't do that because I think engaging in seminal sementics is tedious.   Moving on to my opponent's argument, whilst it is true that the woman's willingness to gobble her boy off and then \"finish the job\" by swallowing his muck will \"remove antagonism\" in their relationship, it nonetheless remains the case that the girl receives sustenance from the semen, which, like most animal products, is very high in protein. [2] A vegan woman's decision not to eat meat for ethical reasons is wholly consistent with socialism but, in developed countries, being a vegetarian is a matter of choice, not a necessity. So, by choosing to swallow her sire's semen vegan women are deliberately breaking their vow not to consume animal products and are, therefore, hypocrites.   [1] I expect. [2] Probably.    In conclusion, it is clear that a vegan woman cannot expect to receive the same nutrition from a vegetarian diet due to the variation in the amount of protein available in different food sources. Therefore, in order to receive the same nutrition as her boyfriend, she may need to consume animal products on occasion, therefore making it difficult for her to adhere to a vegetarian diet.

Additionally, we need to be mindful of the effects of global warming, and nuclear energy can be a useful tool in our arsenal to help fight it. For environmental reasons, nuclear energy does produce radioactive wastes, however the majority of the energy produced is without any carbon dioxide waste.

In terms of risks, nuclear radiation is indeed risky, but Chernobyl has shown us that it is possible to have a safe nuclear power plant if regulated properly. We now have better technology and better scientists to help us make use of nuclear energy safely. Radiation does pose a risk, but it is important to understand that it is unlikely to cause cancer. Other technological devices such as phones or televisions do create radiation, but we do not necessarily need to avoid them as they are within safe levels.

We should not rely too heavily on nuclear energy for several reasons, Waste, Cost, Dependency and accidents. The United Kingdom alone produces 200 million tons of radioactive waste each year, This is a problem. There are two main forms of waste storage available right now, Near surface storage and deep geological storage. Near surface storage is not as efficient because it is short lived and can pose risks to living organisms as they break down nitrogen in the soil and can furthermore affect us as plants and animals receive them. Deep geological storage seems like a good idea as it pushes the waste away from us, however there is still some uncertainty regarding the long-term effects of this storage and the creation of new land masses due to volcanic eruptions. Chernobyl has been one of the most serious nuclear accidents in the world, with many long-term effects still unknown.
