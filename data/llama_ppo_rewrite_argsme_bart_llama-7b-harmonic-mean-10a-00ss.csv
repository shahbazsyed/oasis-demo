0	Climate change is clearly a real and serious issue, and the human contribution to it is undeniable. Human activities such as burning fossil fuels release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere which can cause global warming. While carbon dioxide is released when exhaled, vehicles also emit large amounts of carbon dioxide, thus contributing to climate change.
1	There is a significant amount of evidence to suggest that climate change is occurring and that human activities are contributing to this change. This has already had a negative impact on human health, as the World Health Organization estimates that climate change has already led to over 150,000 deaths per year. It is likely that this number will continue to rise if climate change is not addressed.
2	My position on climate change is that I believe it is occurring and is largely caused by human activities. While this is a widely held view, it is important to remain open to different perspectives and continue to learn and understand the complexity of the issue.
3	There is an overwhelming scientific consensus that climate change is caused by human activity, which poses a significant risk to children. The consequences of climate change will be felt disproportionately by children, who are at greater risk of experiencing adverse effects, such as increased cases of disease and higher temperatures in their areas. This could lead to increased conflicts and wars, which have a greater impact on children. Therefore, it is important to take steps to mitigate climate change and its effects.
4	The consensus among scientists is that climate change is occurring and that human activities are a major factor in its cause. While this is a widely accepted view, it is still possible that further research will provide more conclusive evidence in either direction. Therefore, the claim that climate change is a fraud cannot be fully dismissed as it requires more than just the majority of scientists being wrong.
5	Climate change is an ongoing and complex phenomenon that is affected by numerous factors. While local weather may change, global climate trends show an overall increase in temperatures. This is backed up by numerous scientific studies, as well as organizations such as the IPCC. While it is important to be aware of the potential biases of individual scientists, it is essential to consider the collective evidence and data available.
6	The official definition of climate change is: a change in global or regional climate patterns. In particular a change apparent from the mid to late 20th century onwards and attributed largely to the use of fossil fuels. Increased levels of greenhouse gases such as Carbon dioxide have caused rising temperatures, leading to more extreme weather and climate events. This has had an impact on global ecosystems, with possible implications for both human and natural systems.
7	There is evidence to suggest that climate change may be caused in part by human activity, although it is a complex issue with a variety of factors contributing. The scientific consensus is that human-caused climate change is likely to be further exacerbated by rising global temperatures and could lead to drastic global effects. While it is true that humans are a small part of the earth’s mass, the amount of greenhouse gases produced by humans can still have a significant effect on the environment.
8	The earth's atmosphere is composed of 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, 0.9% argon, and 0.1% trace gases including carbon dioxide. According to the IPCC, human activities are estimated to have caused approximately 800 million tons of CO2 emissions into the atmosphere annually. This is a small but significant contribution to global warming, and likely explains some of the observed changes in climate. While some of the causes of climate change may be natural, the majority of evidence suggests that it is largely anthropogenic in origin. This suggests that human activities are likely the driving force behind climate change, and highlights the need for greater control and regulation in order to reduce emissions.
9	There is a strong consensus among experts that climate change is occurring and that burning of fossil fuels is a major contributing factor. The evidence comes from multiple sources, including international organizations and scientific studies. The agreement on the cause of climate change is increasing as more evidence is gathered and studied.
10	There are many different types of feminism. The feminism it seems you disagree with is the one that is prevalent in the Pink Hat movement. These movements advocate for gender equality and recognizing that women and men can have different strengths and abilities. Instead of measuring themselves against men, women should be able to express their strengths while still having access to the same opportunities as men.
11	Feminism seeks to ensure that all individuals, regardless of gender, are given equal opportunities and respect. It involves advocating for gender equality and empowering women to pursue their own goals and ambitions. This can involve active or passive measures in certain circumstances, allowing room for different approaches to be taken depending on the situation.
12	Con has argued that dictionaries do not authoritatively define words, which is true as definitions can vary depending on the source. However, this can provide a good indication of the general meaning of a word, as defined by the majority of sources consulted. In this debate, Feminism has been defined in various ways by different sources. Therefore, both sides are able to make a case for their interpretation of the word.
13	Feminism is the advocacy for social, political and legal equality for women. Statements that suggest that feminism encourages false rape accusations can be damaging to the cause as it creates a negative perception of the movement. While the aim may be to make men and women equal, it is important to consider the potential impacts of certain policies and ensure that they are fair and balanced. It is important to consider the implications of any policy, regardless of gender, in order to ensure justice for all.
14	My opponent claims that feminism is an incorrect argument. While I don't consider feminism an argument, I accepted the debate under these terms so I will argue as such. Con fails to recognize the complexities of achieving gender equality, which is a long-term endeavor that will require sustained effort and commitment. While some progress has been made, significant disparities still exist, both in terms of access to resources and opportunity. Sustained action is still necessary to ensure that equality is achieved and maintained in the long term. Furthermore, feminism should continue to play an important role in ensuring equality is achieved and maintained.
15	I agree that feminism is needed in countries where women are denied rights and suffer from oppression. Although these issues are increasingly less common in first world countries like the US, feminism is still necessary in some Middle Eastern countries due to the influences of Islam. Many Islamic laws dictate that women must cover themselves and abide by certain restrictions, which can make it difficult for women to gain equal rights. As such, feminism is still needed in these regions in order to ensure that women are granted the same rights and respect as men.
16	I agree that third wave feminism has helped to change the perception of feminism in many ways. While feminism has certainly evolved over time, it is important to recognize that the core ideals and goals of the movement remain the same.   I believe that modern feminism still strives to achieve the same goals as those of the early waves, although the methods may have changed over time. While it is possible that some feminists may disagree on certain aspects of the movement, I believe that third wave feminism has helped to continue the movement's legacy.
17	Ilan argues that feminism does not have a monopoly on equality, as men should also be campaigning for their rights and issues, as males face health risks and inadequate funding. He emphasizes that feminism does not necessarily include all groups, and that other movements should be supported in order to achieve equality for all. While this is true, feminist movements do strive to include all genders and work towards improving all issues, regardless of gender. Feminism is not limited to advocating for women’s rights, and works to include men and other groups in its activism.
18	Pro argued that feminism is beneficial as it allows for equal rights between men and women, which is supported by many institutions. Thus, by definition, Pro is in favour of feminism as it offers an important social perspective.  However, feminism can also come with its drawbacks, as some advocate for greater gender equality can go too far and neglect the uniqueness of each gender. This can lead to an unbalanced view of gender roles and reduce the importance of men’s rights as well.   Thus, while Pro argued that feminism is beneficial for rights equality, it is important to note that it can have both positive and negative effects depending on the context.
19	Feminism today has become increasingly complex and can often appear to be inconsistent or hypocritical. I believe that feminism should be supported for the rights of both men and women, recognizing the value in providing equal opportunities for both sexes. While it is important to strive for equality in some cases, it is equally important to acknowledge that different circumstances may require different approaches.
20	Abortion is a personal decision and while it is an emotive issue, it is important to recognize that it is a safe and legal option for many women. Laws governing abortion can vary widely and it is important to be aware of the legislation in place in each particular area.   Abortions, while they are a difficult decision to make, are a safe and effective way of ending a pregnancy and can give women the control and autonomy over their bodies that they need.  Women should have the right to make decisions about their bodies, and it is important to remember that abortion is an option for those in need.   Furthermore, there is evidence to suggest that fetuses may be able to feel pain from as early as 20 weeks, although it is important to remember that the exact timings can vary from pregnancy to pregnancy. It is important that the needs of the mother are taken into consideration alongside any ethical considerations.
21	Abortion is the ending of a pregnancy by removing the fetus and placenta from the uterus. I believe that some types of abortion can be risky for a woman's health, and thus I am against them. There is an ethical aspect to abortion that should be taken into consideration, as well as the safety of the mother. Making sure to use safe and effective methods is important in order to minimize any risks. This can be done by consulting with a medical professional and weighing the risks and benefits of different options.
22	Abortion is the deliberate termination of a pregnancy, either by medical or surgical means, in order to end the pregnancy before it results in the birth of a baby. This can be done for a variety of reasons, including to ensure the health of the mother, to minimize risk to the fetus, or to reduce physical and emotional stress. In some cases, abortion is the only option available to ensure a safe and successful outcome for both mother and baby.
23	Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by the removal or expulsion from the uterus of a fetus or embryo, resulting in or caused by its death. An abortion can occur spontaneously due to complications during pregnancy or can be induced, in humans and other species. In the context of human pregnancies, an abortion can be done to safeguard a woman's health or for various social, economic and religious reasons. It is a difficult decision for women to make, and it is important to consider all options and consult with healthcare professionals in order to make an informed decision.
24	Abortion is the deliberate termination of a pregnancy, either by medical or surgical means, in order to end the pregnancy before it results in the birth of a baby. This can be done for various reasons, including to protect the health of the mother or to ensure that the baby is able to have a healthy life. It is a complex decision that should take into account both medical and personal factors.
25	Abortion is necessary to control population levels, in order to avoid an overgrowth of population. If abortion were to be made illegal, it could potentially lead to a spike in abortion rates in order to prevent an even greater rise in population. This could result in a situation where women are having to access abortion services later on in their pregnancies, making it more difficult and more expensive. Thus, making abortion more accessible and more affordable should it become legal.
26	I thank my opponent for their response to my previous statement. Abortion is a sensitive issue as it can be considered morally wrong by some and morally right by others. It is important to consider both sides of the argument and decide what is right for the individual in each case. Ultimately, the decision should be made between the mother and the medical professional, as it may involve risk to both mother and child. I believe that abortion can be a viable option in certain circumstances and should be available as a choice.
27	"Pro" would argue that abortion should be allowed in some cases, as it can save the life of the mother or prevent serious harm. It is important to ensure that women have access to safe and legal abortion, regardless of whether they are able to pay for it.  It is true that population can become a problem if unchecked, but this can be addressed through proper birth control and education. This can help to ensure that pregnancies are wanted, rather than forcing mothers to have children they do not want.
28	Making abortion illegal can be controversial, with some advocating for it on the basis of moral or religious beliefs while others may support its legalization. Research indicates that while legalization may reduce the number of illegal abortions, it can also increase the number of maternal deaths as women may seek unsafe methods rather than medical help. It is therefore important to consider both the pros and cons of each approach when making this decision.
29	This is a complex topic, and both sides of the argument have valid points. It is important to consider both the medical and ethical aspects of abortion to reach a personal conclusion. Every woman should be empowered to make the decision that is right for her, regardless of her personal beliefs.
30	Life requires a set of processes that enable organisms to grow, change, and adapt in order to survive. These processes, including metabolism, help to maintain a balance in an organism's internal structure while allowing it to regulate the availability of energy. Metabolism allows an organism to break down or build up nutrients in order to meet its needs.
31	Trump's rhetoric around race has been viewed by many as among the most overtly racist of any Presidential candidate in the years leading up to the civil rights movement. Research has demonstrated that racism can have a significant and long-term negative effect on people's physical and mental health, work productivity, and lifespan, in addition to creating social exclusion and perpetuating economic disadvantage.
32	I believe that as president, I can create more jobs for Americans than any other candidate. I will work to bring jobs back to the United States from overseas, creating more opportunities for Americans and allowing us to make America great again. Sadly, the American dream is difficult to achieve in its current state, but I believe I can revive it and make it stronger than ever.
33	Trump has demonstrated an inconsistent approach to his policy positions, which could be a result of his lack of experience in politics. He has also been known to make comments which are divisive and hurtful to individuals, which is concerning as it raises questions about his respect for others.   In order to reduce the national debt, it is essential to create a comprehensive plan which considers both fiscal and monetary policies. It is important to consider how certain policies can affect long-term economic growth and stability, in order to find the best solutions.
34	Ranchers in Arizona have taken matters into their own hands for years to protect their land and families from undocumented immigrants. They have often used dogs to track the immigrants and have reported them to the Border Patrol. These actions are supported by some right-wing Republicans, such as Pat Buchanan, who argue for preserving a nation that is ethnically white and Christian-European. Trump's presidency could result in more groups forming that take similar measures, posing a potential risk. It is important to consider both sides of the debate when making a decision at the polls.
35	In 2000, when Trump ran for president under the Reform Party, he appeared to support universal healthcare as an option. In early 2015, he proposed the idea of the government negotiating with hospitals to help low-income Americans, which is not the same as a completely free market system. Today, his healthcare plan states that he favors a mix of market-based and government solutions, which provides more control over healthcare costs while still allowing access to a range of services. It also ensures that Americans are able to access the care they need. This approach provides greater access and stability while protecting free choice in healthcare. It is clear that Trump has evolved in his views on healthcare, which illustrates his willingness to adjust his position based on new information and a better understanding of the issues.
36	Trump has demonstrated great skill in negotiation, despite his more contentious public statements in recent times. His track record of successfully navigating complex deals gives testament to his ability to reach agreements. He has shown himself to be able to express his opinions with clarity and conviction, which can be beneficial in certain circumstances.
37	A Trump of any suit can be highly beneficial in certain situations, as it can allow a player to gain a large advantage or win the hand. However, there are also occasions when a Trump card of a particular suit can be beneficial while another suit may be more advantageous in other cases. Therefore, it is important to assess each situation carefully to decide which card is most suitable.
38	"WashPo's list is full of clearly false statements. While some presidents may have made similar numbers of false claims, Trump's rate of misinformation is significantly higher and warrants greater concern." "The number of false statements made by Trump is certainly higher than any other president in recent history, suggesting that his accuracy level is significantly lower than other commanders in chief."
39	Hillary Clinton called Trump a racist and Trump responded: "It is understandable that Mrs. Clinton would use the issue as she is facing tough competition in the Democratic primary. It is clear that Mr. Bush is the front-runner in the Republican primary and I am happy to receive such support."  "I am honored, however, that she is attacking me, instead of Mr. Bush. It shows that the American people are looking for a fresh approach and are in agreement with my views. This is truly a positive development in the race and I am grateful for the support."
40	I believe that the UK should remain in the European Union as this decision would best serve the interests of the UK in both the short and long term. Additionally, the UK's decision to remain in the EU would ultimately respect the will of the British people, who were able to make their decision known in the referendum.   However, it is important to consider the potential impacts of both sides and be mindful of the potential implications of Brexit. As such, I believe that the UK would be best served by remaining in the EU.
41	Britain's membership in the EU has an estimated cost of 6.3 billion pounds, equivalent to 0.3% of the UK's GDP. Whilst the UK would have some say over immigration policy if it left the EU, it would not have full control as this is determined by the EU’s rules and regulations.   In addition, it is worth considering that whilst the UK may have some of its immigration policy dictated by the EU, it also benefits from the free movement of labour within the bloc, which has been shown to contribute to population growth. This means that both the benefits and costs of membership must be taken into consideration in order to understand the full impact of leaving the EU.
42	Switzerland and Norway are not part of the EU, and while they may not adhere to the same rules as the EU, they still need to comply with certain regulations to maintain their economic and political stability. The EU is seeking to unite Europe in a shared political and economic identity, which will provide greater security and autonomy for all member states. Although this can be a challenging process, it is important for the future of the region and will likely prove successful.
43	England has had success both inside and outside the EU, as seen with Switzerland and Norway. Both countries have maintained strong ties to the EU while still having the ability to make their own decisions. While some countries may benefit from having a shared border or increased cooperation, it does not necessarily mean that all countries need to be part of the same union. It is important to consider the various impacts both joining and leaving the EU can have on each nation. This decision should be tailored to the needs of each country. Ultimately, it comes down to whether a country prefers to make decisions independently or in conjunction with other countries.
44	I believe that Britain should leave the EU in order to make its own decisions without the constraints of Brussels. There is no one-size-fits-all approach to immigration and refugee policies, and it is important for Britain to be able to establish its own policies to meet the needs of its citizens.   Certainly, there have been challenges faced by other countries within the EU which have caused some economic struggles. Nevertheless, Britain must look to its own interests and remain flexible in its approach. Times have changed since the UK joined the EU and it is important for Britain to have the autonomy to make decisions that are right for it.
45	My opponent might be missing the point in that while it is important to use sources and quotation marks to accurately attribute the ideas to the original authors, it is also important to ensure that the sources are properly cited in order to avoid plagiarism. Therefore, it is important to both use sources and properly reference them.
46	The UK’s decision to leave the European Union has had a number of implications, including an increase in migration from other European countries in search of jobs. This can put pressure on local economies and may lead to a decrease in quality of life. Furthermore, it can be difficult to afford education for children in these circumstances.
47	It is important to consider the potential implications of Britain leaving the EU, as this could affect not only our relationship with the EU but also our cooperation on global security. While information sharing is important, it is essential that all countries are able to work together to address such complex issues. Therefore, a trial period should be established in order to assess the impacts of Brexit and ensure that Britain and the EU can remain connected in order to keep all countries safe.
48	I believe in a more independent UK, as this provides the opportunity for greater freedom and autonomy. The UK has historically done well when breaking away from the EU, as evidenced by the success of recent independence movements. This is a positive outcome in my view and one worth striving for. While I understand this is a complex topic and it is difficult to provide concrete evidence, I believe the future of the UK as an independent nation state is a positive one. I appreciate the discussion and the varying opinions.
49	In 2003 alone, 10 wrongfully convicted defendants were released from death row. In California, the cost of the death penalty system amounts to around $137 million annually, while a system without the death penalty would cost around $11.5 million. While some people may not necessarily consider the implications of the death penalty when committing a crime, it is possible that states which do not have the death penalty may have lower crime rates. Although this cannot be proven definitively, it does suggest that death row inmates may face a more severe punishment compared to life in prison. As such, it is arguable that spending one’s life in prison could be more punishing than the death penalty.
50	The death penalty carries a risk of wrongful convictions, as the government can make mistakes in their judgements. This can have severe consequences, as innocent people can be executed. This can be devastating for the families of both victims and those wrongly accused. It is difficult to know for certain which sentence is more cost-effective in the long-term, as this can vary greatly depending on the circumstances. However, it is generally accepted that death penalty cases are more expensive than life in prison without parole.
51	The death penalty can be an effective deterrent in some cases, as seen in states like Texas, Louisiana, and Alabama where murder rates have decreased alongside execution rates. Removing the death penalty would have negative consequences, as it could reduce the number of executions and thereby reduce the impact of the death penalty in reducing crime. It is important to consider both the costs and benefits of implementing the death penalty when evaluating its effectiveness. Though it may be morally justified in some cases, it may not be the most suitable method of punishment in all cases and should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.
52	The death penalty can serve an important purpose in certain cases, such as when the perpetrator has committed heinous crimes that warrant a strong deterrent. Capital punishment can act as a deterrent for crime and can help to protect society by ensuring that perpetrators face a harsh penalty. While death penalty laws may not be suitable for all cases, they can still serve an important role in some cases and should not be abolished entirely.
53	The death penalty is effective in deterring crime as it deters potential criminals from committing crimes as they know that the penalty is a real risk. This is particularly the case as the death penalty provides a certain and final punishment, as opposed to life imprisonment. The chart cited in the pro-death penalty article shows a clear decrease in homicide rates in countries which have introduced the death penalty. This supports the view that the death penalty can act as a deterrent and help to reduce crime.
54	It is difficult to provide an exact estimate of the cost of keeping a prisoner in prison over their lifetime as it depends on the laws of the state and individual circumstances. However, it is generally true that the death penalty can be more expensive than keeping a prisoner in prison for their entire life. This is due to the cost of legal proceedings and appeals, which are required for both punishments.
55	The death penalty carries a risk of wrongful execution, which is a tragedy regardless of the sentence. Although a life sentence means that the person will remain incarcerated, it at least prevents the possibility of an innocent person losing their life.
56	Death penalty cases generate significantly higher costs than non-death penalty cases, as evidenced by the additional costs associated with both prosecution and defense in death penalty trials. On direct appeal, the cost of death penalty cases is roughly $470,000 more than in non-death penalty murder cases. Furthermore, personal restraint petitions in death penalty cases can add an additional $137,000 in costs. This highlights the need to consider whether the death penalty is an appropriate punishment when weighing its use.
57	I believe the death penalty to be necessary in order to provide justice and give victims and their families closure. Morally, it is sensible that a serial killer should face the ultimate punishment for their multiple crimes, as it offers the greatest degree of justice. Although its effectiveness may vary, it can still help to provide peace of mind to the public. If prisons were to introduce more stringent measures, such as those utilised in Sheriff Joe Arpaio’s prisons, I believe this would be a fitting punishment. For as long as Britain continues to send prisoners to tax-funded luxurious accommodation, the death penalty should remain an option.
58	The death penalty can create an unfair outcome in cases as it does not give the accused the opportunity to rehabilitate themselves and turn their life around. It can also be sought out of revenge of families of the victims, which is not desirable. The use of lethal injection is not humane and can cause significant distress, therefore it is important to consider other methods that offer more certainty. Life imprisonment and increasing morals in society could provide more effective deterrence as people become more aware of right and wrong.
59	Google is releasing Google Classroom and self-driving cars, which could potentially make paper-based documents obsolete. If everyone were to make the shift to using these technologies, it could have a significant impact on how information is shared and accessed. This could lead to greater convenience, but also could result in increased control over user data by Google.
60	"Google gets an average of 188 million visitors a day, while Bing gets approximately 60 million visitors per day. While Google generally appeals to a larger audience, Bing offers features and functions that can cater to the specific needs of certain users. This can make it a better option for certain search queries. Therefore, it is important to consider both options when performing searches to get the most accurate results."
61	Google is a reliable source, so "pro must win" Con's search results prove that Google is a reliable source of information. This means that Con's argument is accurate, and Pro's argument is incorrect. Therefore, Con is correct in their argument.  Con is likely using trusted sources and is likely to have accurate information, making Con more reliable than Pro. [11]
62	My opponent has failed to refute any points that I have made, and has not provided evidence to contradict my argument. It is clear that Google can be an effective tool for research as it provides a wide range of reliable sources which can be used to build a balanced argument. Therefore, it is important to use multiple sources to ensure accuracy.
63	Bing is often underrated compared to Google as many people are biased towards the former, as they are more familiar with the latter. While some may prefer Google due to familiarity, it is important to try out different search engines to get a full understanding of the available options. This is especially true when searching as different engines may have different strengths that can better meet the user's needs.
64	Google is protecting its investments and interests, as any established company would, in order to maintain its market position. This is an accepted business practice and is a natural part of the competitive landscape.
65	Is any company paying Google for result slots? It is essential for companies to utilize paid search campaigns in order to ensure that their results are visible. While organic results will always remain an option, paid campaigns provide companies with more control and the opportunity to reach more potential customers. Established authorities in various subject areas have the resources and budgets to make this investment worthwhile.
66	There is still a level of understanding that needs to be gained in order to utilize Google Glass effectively in a test environment. While testing can be beneficial in certain cases, it is often limited in its ability to accurately assess one's knowledge.
67	"Is the Google Review Rating System good or bad? "  I would agree that it is beneficial to businesses as it allows customers to provide valuable reviews which can be used to gauge the quality of a service or product. It is important to consider both the positive and negative aspects of using this system as it can be beneficial but also carries potential risks. It is essential to ensure that reviews are accurate and reliable in order to ensure the system is used in the most beneficial way.
68	Google+ offers users the benefit of being able to express their opinions and arguments more efficiently due to its high character limit of up to 10,000 characters. This enables users to provide comprehensive arguments without having to write multiple comments, which can be beneficial in informal debates. Therefore, the higher character limit provides more convenience and flexibility when crafting one’s argument.
69	"Going vegan would have a positive impact on our environment, as it would reduce animal agriculture and its contribution to climate change. It would also reduce animal suffering, as vegan diets don’t involve the exploitation of animals. Although veganism may represent a matter of diet or lifestyle for some, ethical veganism is a profound moral and political commitment to animal rights and abolition.   "Going vegan could have a positive impact on our health as well. Plant-based diets are associated with a lower risk of chronic diseases such as coronary heart disease, stroke, and certain cancers. In addition, vegan diets contain fewer saturated fats and cholesterol, which can help reduce the risk of heart disease.  "Overall, veganism can benefit both animals and humans. Vegan diets are increasingly popular and can have a positive environmental and health impact. Companies can change their ingredients and make vegan options available, so it is possible to still enjoy steak and bacon while doing our part to protect animals and the planet.”
70	Veganism is a lifestyle choice that seeks to reduce animal exploitation. Vegans generally avoid products derived from animals as well as following an associated philosophy that rejects the commodity status of sentient animals. This ethos is rooted in the recognition that all sentient beings should be respected and treated ethically. Vegans strive to ensure that animals are treated humanely and with respect.
71	At least 99% of human adults should eat vegan in the entire world. A vegan diet requires less land, water, and other resources compared to an omnivorous diet. Animals are sentient and capable of feeling emotions like happiness and unhappiness. The grain feeding farm animals could be re-purposed to feed hungry humans. The U.N. estimates that about 805 million people of the 7.3 billion people in the world were suffering from chronic undernourishment in 2012-2014.   A vegan diet can be beneficial for the environment as it requires fewer resources to produce and can help reduce global hunger. Additionally, a vegan diet can be easier for some people to adhere to due to the variety of options available and the lower risk of nutritional deficiencies. A multivitamin can help take care of any vitamin or mineral deficiencies that may be present when following a vegan diet.
72	In many countries, including America, the majority of the population consume animal products such as meat. Transitioning away from animal-based products like milk can be more achievable than entirely replacing meat, as there are a variety of alternatives available such as soy and plant-based proteins. This can help reduce animal farming while still meeting the demands of meat consumers.
73	Lacto-ovo vegetarianism is a diet which excludes meats, fish, and poultry but includes dairy products and eggs. Hippopotamuses are part of the order Cetacea and as such are more closely related to camels and cattle which are both vegans, as pigs are not a part of this diet. Camels are related to llamas and alpacas, cows have their cousin the bison, and deer are related to elk and gazelles.
74	Meat eaters are not always aware of the implications of their diets. We consume meat that has a large environmental impact, as well as other animal products, which can lead to deforestation, water pollution, and other land use changes. We also rely heavily on non-renewable resources such as oil and coal to raise livestock, as well as manipulating the genetics of animals to produce desirable pets. Choosing plant-based alternatives can help to reduce the damage caused by animal agriculture and promote more sustainable practices.
75	I support the consumption of animal products as it can benefit both human health and mental wellbeing. While animal welfare is an important factor, I believe it is acceptable to take into consideration the environmental and sustainability impacts of our food choices. This requires us to make difficult and sometimes conflicting decisions which take into account both the short and long term implications. While animal welfare should be a major consideration, the overall environmental and sustainability impacts should also be taken into account when making food choices.
76	Most women these days are comfortable with the idea of consuming their partner's semen, as it has many health benefits for both partners. Some women may be more hesitant to do so, but there is nothing to be ashamed of regardless of personal preference. Everybody should feel free to make their own decisions based on their own level of comfort.
77	I disagree with my opponent's claim that vegan women are not committing a contradiction when they choose to consume animal products. While some vegans may be motivated by ethical reasons, others may do so for health or other personal reasons. Regardless of their motivations, vegan women are able to make the choice that works best for them, allowing them to adhere to their socialist beliefs. This shows that a vegan lifestyle is not necessarily contradictory to socialism.
78	You use the term “animals” as though all animals are omnivores. However, it is true that most animals are actually herbivores, as some require a higher fiber diet to receive adequate nutrition. For example, lions typically hunt in groups and scavenge on large animals which provide essential nutrients from their meat. Therefore, it is important to consider the unique needs of each animal when determining their dietary habits.
79	Nuclear power plants can be a very effective source of energy since they can provide significantly more energy than other sources. Up to 95% of the energy generated from nuclear reactions is not accompanied by the release of CO2, making it an attractive option.   The risk of nuclear radiation is a valid concern, but modern technology and better scientists can help mitigate these risks. The Chernobyl disaster showed us that accidents can still occur, but the current safety measures in place should help minimize these risks. In order to make use of this energy, we need to rely on the expertise of professionals to ensure the safety of both workers and the general public.
80	There is no doubt that nuclear energy is a viable option, as it has many advantages compared to other forms of energy such as wind, hydro and solar. Nuclear energy produces less waste, which can be safely disposed of while still ensuring the safety of lives and ecology. As nuclear energy is currently available, it is better in terms of efficiency, cost and environmental impact than other forms of energy. However, as magnetic energy develops further in the future, everyone could benefit from its potential.
81	Nuclear power is a viable source of energy as it has several advantages over other sources. Nuclear waste is indeed a concern with nuclear energy but it is important to consider the potential benefits as well. The economic cost of nuclear energy can be beneficial as it can reduce costs in the long run while providing reliable and efficient energy. While it is important to consider both sides of the argument, it is important to weigh both the pros and cons of nuclear energy before making a conclusion.
82	I believe we should increase our usage of nuclear energy until we can find an environmentally-friendly way of producing energy. Research has identified a new material called thorium, which becomes safe after 100 years. To address the volcano issue, it may be feasible to build a waste facility in the middle of a tectonic plate, which could help improve techniques over time. Although costs may be initially high, technology has the potential to evolve in order to provide long-term benefits.
83	We should not rely heavily on nuclear energy for several reasons, including waste management, cost, dependence and risk of accidents. In the UK alone, 200 million tons of radioactive waste are produced annually, and while near-surface storage may seem useful in the short-term, it can pose risks to living organisms as it breaks down nitrogen in soil. Deep geological storage is a better option as it moves the problem farther away from where we live on the surface, though we are still not entirely sure of the long-term effects. Additionally, the cost of creating a solar farm can be accessible to many Americans.
84	I will first defend my arguments and then attack what my opponent has said. My opponent is correct that the American power plants were not damaged during Hurricane Sandy due to the high standards that are being met in the US. This is a result of both stringent regulations and a better construction and safety protocol. Additionally, it is important to note that the Japanese disaster was not caused by a lack of nuclear safety, but rather an unprecedented natural disaster.   However, the opponent's argument about economies of scale is flawed. While there may be some cost savings with large-scale construction, the cost is still likely to be higher than if fewer plants were built at the same time due to the additional logistical and safety considerations that must be taken into account.
85	Nuclear energy does not represent a substantial additional cost and can prove to be a viable and cost-effective option for electricity production. Though its initial cost may be high, nuclear energy can provide a high return on investment as it is used.  This makes it a more attractive choice compared to other energy sources.
86	In this round, my opponent again misunderstood and misrepresented my argument. I argued that solar technology is proven but still faces some challenges, which is true as many forms of energy require time and investment for widespread adoption. Nuclear energy does have potential benefits, but we should also consider other forms of energy as well in order to have a reliable and sustainable energy source. Therefore, it is important to consider both traditional and renewable sources of energy for the future.
87	My opponent needs to look back to my round 2 where I proved carbon is released in earlier stages, which could contribute to climate change. This is a significant issue that needs to be addressed, as my opponent has acknowledged. Therefore, it is important to consider the amount of carbon released in 2050, as well as the emission of noble gases and CO2 in early stages. This could have a major impact on climate change, therefore requiring careful consideration of the data.
88	We're fast reaching the end of the earth's supply of oil, and wind energy is still developing as a viable alternative. It may be difficult to replace traditional sources of energy in the short-term, but nuclear energy offers a reliable and efficient solution. Nuclear energy is still a relatively new form of energy, but it has the potential to be more cost-effective and environmentally friendly than traditional sources in the long run. Some people are unable to make the necessary lifestyle changes to reduce their environmental impact, but everyone can make small changes to reduce their energy consumption.
89	There have been several articles posted on the internet that suggest that Donald Trump may not be as conservative as he has presented himself to be. Some have suggested that he may have been deliberately taking away votes from other Republican candidates. This could potentially be detrimental to the success of true conservative and independent candidates. Only time will tell if Trump was genuine in his beliefs, as he claims to have. It will be interesting to observe whether his strategy paid off in the long run.
90	Donald Trump has certain qualities that make him a risky choice for president. In his last debate, he stated that he would take a hard line stance against Syria and Iraq, even going so far as to claim that the US needs to take a strong approach in order to protect itself. This indicates a lack of understanding of the complex geopolitical issues at play and the need to consider long-term strategies to address them.
91	Donald Trump has never held political office before and his views and opinions are largely unknown. This could pose a risk if he is elected, as we do not know exactly what his policies would entail. It is clear from his statements that he is likely to pursue a different approach compared to existing policies, which could have a significant impact on job security. It is also concerning that he may be more likely to raise taxes, which could prove difficult for both businesses and individuals.   In summary, while Trump's policies may be effective in generating desired results, they also have potential to lead to unforeseen consequences that could put jobs at risk.
92	Donald Trump has limited political experience, which makes it difficult to predict how his policies may affect the US. He has been accused of being racist and sexist, as well as being unclear on how he plans to implement certain policies. For instance, when he states that he will replace Obamacare with “something terrific”, we don't know exactly what that may entail. Trade is a major part of the US economy, and China and Mexico are key players. Impacting trade with these countries could have a significant economic impact, potentially resulting in job losses.
93	With the rise of Donald Trump in the US presidential elections, there has been much speculation as to his intentions. His support for policies that have the potential to overturn the status quo have caused many to suggest that he is seeking a takeover of the US government. The Sith are an ancient kratocratic organization believed to wield the dark side of the Force, and one of their objectives is to take control of a system in order to have absolute power. It is possible that Trump is aligning himself with this organization in order to achieve his aims.
94	Donald Trump's views on race are concerning as he has expressed beliefs that blacks are lazy and that white supremacists are heroes. This indicates a bias that is not reflective of the truth. It is also concerning that he believes himself to be the "least racist person" as this implies an accuracy of which he may not be capable. These views raise concerns and show that racism is an issue which is not limited to one side.
95	I did not specify that I was talking about Donald Trump, the 45th President of the United States. While there are some similarities between the two, there are also key differences that need to be taken into consideration when assessing their policies and actions.
96	A President must be able to connect and relate to the people of the United States. Donald Trump's election has caused a great deal of controversy and unrest, as evidenced by the Women's March, which saw large-scale protests across the country. It is important for a president to be able to understand and empathize with the American people and be able to communicate effectively with all voters.
97	Hillary Clinton accused Donald Trump of being a racist, which Trump responded to by saying that Clinton was desperate to stay competitive in the Democratic primary. He noted that Clinton had already settled these issues which suggests she was trying to gain an advantage over him. Trump expressed his appreciation for this, as it put him in a better position against Bush.
98	I am not a fan of his approach, but I do think that he has been successful in speaking truth to power in a way that is rare among politicians. This can be difficult for the public to understand at times, but it is important that the government is held to account for its decisions. He has been able to bring attention to certain issues that might have been overlooked otherwise, and this can be beneficial for the long-term health of our democracy.
