0	The argument that porn can increase one's maturity and prevent potential future sexual assaults is flawed. While there is no denying that pornography can be addictive and damaging, it is likely too extreme a consequence for a single person to confront. There are much better and healthier outlets to explore one's sexuality. Therefore, porn is clearly wrong and should be avoided whenever possible.
1	My sister's husband earns a good salary, yet they still qualify for assistance such as W.I.C, Daycare Assistance, and food stamps. She should look into these services to help her get by.
2	Sadism, the practice of violence or cruelty against others for personal or sexual gratification, is the most heinous act a person can commit. Those who engage in it must be subjugated, weakening the active participant and compounding the act of violence. This is "evil", but if all participants are consenting adults, it may be viewed as a form of masochism from the hands of another. Although it may seem to be an oxymoron, this form of interpersonal violence is still "assisted" masochism. Although these individuals may be considered strange, it is not the concern of others what two (or more) consenting adults do in private.
3	We should invest heavily in researching animal combinations, such as a half gorilla, half octopus. It would have an octopus' face, two legs and six wavy arms, as well as a furry body. Though some may argue that we should not play God, I believe that the end result would be worth the cost and effort. Imagine a turtle with a chicken's head roaming around your home – it would be fascinating!
4	Gun control laws are largely ineffective as criminals can easily obtain weapons, while well-armed citizens are able to deter criminal activity. Furthermore, the Second Amendment was put in place to ensure citizens can resist an overreaching government.
5	Being horny is a natural feeling, yet religion teaches that these feelings are wrong. This could be a contributing factor to rape in the Middle East and Asia, as young men do not have a clear understanding of what is right and wrong. Teaching morals, not religion, could be a more effective way of preventing rape.
6	Lesbians are often seen as more socially acceptable than gay men, as they do not pose a threat to traditional gender roles and male dominance. Additionally, gay women are less likely to face discrimination due to the idea that romantic interest in women is an attribute exclusive to men, thus giving them honour. Conversely, gay men are discriminated against due to their attraction to other men, which is seen as lowering their honor in the traditional hierarchy.
7	The Chinese government is oppressive and still engages in beatings and torture, despite the United States turning a blind eye in order to preserve good economic relations. We should wake up and recognize the truth.
8	nuitsen argued that the Denmark caricatures were not ethical and even insensitive, but they were done in response to the suicide bombers and do not respect others' beliefs and truths. However, we do not see protests against the suicide bombers from the wider Muslim community, despite Islam supposedly being a peaceful religion. The suicide bombers have no respect for others' beliefs, even killing fellow Muslims in Iraq. Denmark's caricatures also do not respect others' beliefs, yet we do not see people protesting about it.
9	In life, being successful often involves taking risks and playing to win, regardless of how others treat you. Although being kind and compassionate may lead to hardships, it can also bring rewards. Nonetheless, life is not fair and people often become successful despite being selfish and taking what they want. This shows that success may be attained by any means, regardless of how others are treated.
10	Scott Peterson was a white contrast to OJ Simpson, and like him, he murdered the mother of his children. The similarities stopped there, as Peterson and his wife Laci were good-looking, which made the TV images appealing. We watched the trial for the same reasons as with Michael Douglas and Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction: a tale of a love triangle gone wrong. His version of reality was off the reservation, and it was a warning sign to the rest of us that an affair, particularly when the wife is at home pregnant, can lead to grave consequences. Peterson's story serves as a reminder that a person’s background does not grant them leniency in the eyes of the law. Despite being an average white man, he did not receive the same type of acquittal as OJ Simpson.
11	Hamas has been firing hundreds of missiles into Israel for two weeks, despite numerous ceasefire attempts from Israel. As the main goal of Hamas is to destroy Israel, Israel has the right to retaliate and neutralize the terrorist organization. Additionally, Hamas is responsible for increasing civilian casualties by launching missiles from populated areas, and Israel should not be held accountable for any casualties caused by this. Therefore, invading Gaza to prevent further bombings is justified.
12	The government should not interfere with marriages or civil unions and should grant equal rights to all. For plural marriages, there is not enough support for them to be accepted, and they are a different debate for another day. As for same-sex marriages, some of the most monogamous couples are gay and they are great parents. Allowing them to marry would provide support and recognition for these couples.
13	In my experience as an undergraduate Engineering student, I have found that universities do not inspire, and have lost the true meaning of education. Everyone is just passing through, and no one notices when you have a passion for something. This shows that universities are just a production line for the corporate world.
14	Bad Company 2 is perceived as boring due to its slow pace, strange controls, and immense maps. Meanwhile, Call of Duty provides an intense experience with its variety of gameplay elements such as sniper battles, thrown grenades, and tense survival scenarios. Weapons in Bad Company 2 are not as realistic as those in Call of Duty, with the at4 being an exception. Furthermore, Battlefield's maps are too large to provide a truly satisfying gaming experience. In conclusion, Call of Duty is the superior game, providing an unmatched combination of intense gameplay and realism.
15	Given that the death penalty is used to retaliate against society and give a public example, televised executions may be useful in informing the public about the reality of capital punishment in the US. This could potentially change people's beliefs and attitudes towards the death penalty.
16	Democracy and western values are not always the answer for countries in conflict, as the Muslim world lacks the Enlightenment background required to form such governments. Additionally, Islam demands that church and state be unified, making it more difficult to create a secular constitutional republic. In America, we have a wall of separation between religion and the government, allowing citizens to follow their conscience. However, until the Muslim world undergoes its own Enlightenment, western democracy will likely fail in these regions. Military force is currently the only option for controlling these areas, which leads to the instability we now see in the Middle East.
17	Some laws can be seen as contradictory to morality, but whether or not it's justified to break them depends on the severity of the law and the consequences of getting caught. Breaking laws that don't infringe on human rights and religious beliefs is an option some people take, but it's a risky course of action and may not be the best way to go about challenging laws. In some cases, petitioning the government or suing in court may be more effective.
18	The Incredible Hulk, also known as Thoughtprocess' Momma, is very difficult to defeat due to her immense strength which increases with her anger. This makes her stronger than Optimus Prime, who has many weapons but is not powerful enough to defeat her.
19	In a public or shared space, men should not be expected to put the toilet seat down after urinating, as this is an unreasonable request. Furthermore, it is unreasonable to expect men to always put the toilet seat up after use, as the next user could be a man who needs to urinate in the toilet. Additionally, it should be noted that not putting the toilet seat up after use could potentially inconvenience other users of the toilet. Lastly, it is not reasonable to expect men to look before using the toilet while also expecting women to do the same, as this would put an unreasonable burden on men.
20	In India, the government has not shut down all ladies' bars, only in Maharashtra. The government took this action due to complaints from housewives about their male family members wasting money on ladies' bars and not taking care of their families. Additionally, criminal activities such as the Tarannum case and Telgi's practice of throwing away one lac a day on bar girls led the government to put a stop to these types of activities.
21	Gay marriage is not the right thing as it goes against traditional views on marriage. However, if two people want to live in sin together, we should not punish them and deny them tax breaks. Additionally, we should not use our children to propagate our views and let them learn that homosexuality is not right. If we don't stop it now, society will fall into chaos.
22	The civil war quest line and story in Skyrim weakens as the storm-cloaks are portrayed as the villains of the conflict, with no redeeming qualities or moral ambiguity. Ulfric's use of the thu'um to kill the high king further emphasizes their villainy, as does their apparent racism and mistreatment of others. It is difficult to sympathize with their cause or understand why anyone would support them.
23	India has the potential to lead the world due to its impressive number of IITians working in NASA and its capable of producing. To make use of this potential, India needs to improve its industrial sector by providing suitable jobs, working environments, and salaries to attract its educated youth. This will ultimately increase India's international status in terms of education and knowledge.
24	Porn rarely leads to addiction and is only an issue for individuals with weak mental health or attachment issues, who are unable to differentiate between fantasy and reality. It is sometimes used to spice up sexual encounters, but it is still only a fantasy. People are aware of their desires and use porn to fulfill them in a safe and consensual way.
25	It appears there are more young men than women who are likely to be involved in car accidents. However, this doesn't justify charging young men more for car insurance because of their gender. If anything, this should be taken into consideration when determining rates for all individuals regardless of gender.
26	Jesus was not a hippie and was not the first one, nor was he married. He was a Nazarene and is widely accepted to have risen from the dead, with many eye witness accounts testifying to this. Those who claim otherwise have yet to provide any evidence to prove that he did not.
27	The implementation of India's reservation system was initially created to please certain voters and has since been used as a way to gain quick votes. However, this system has faced opposition as the benefits are not reaching the actual people in need, instead being taken up by some members of the society who are already from a higher class. Although there are some aspects of reservation that provide support to those in need, the benefits are still not reaching those who desperately need it.
28	Russian people generally have a negative sentiment towards foreigners due to the actions of their governments, which have been deemed unacceptable by the global community. This can lead to suspicion and hostility towards those from different countries.
29	Yes, it should be of unlimited proportions. Freedom of speech should not and cannot be twisted to the point where it is no longer freedom of speech. Producing those cartoons was technically legal, but it was irresponsible. Surely the cartoonist knew that those cartoons would cause trouble in extremist countries. However, I also think that the Islamic world is greatly overreacting. They are ruining their credibility and making themselves look like a bunch of whinging little kids who riot at the most petty insult. Do you know how many "Jesus Christ" parody websites exist online? How many Christians burn down embassies for stuff like that?
30	When Latinos migrate to other countries, they may retain their native Spanish language, which can contribute to a similar accent when speaking English. However, this is not an excuse to justify breaking a law or neglecting cultural norms of the country they have moved to. Everyone should be held accountable for their actions, regardless of cultural background.
31	I don't think it is a waste of time to explore space, but we should focus on solving our own planet's problems first. Global Warming is the biggest threat to our world, and scientists should prioritize fixing that instead of trying to make other planets inhabitable.
32	The issue of smoking ban is often controversial as it involves both personal freedom and public health. Some argue that it should be a government choice while others believe it should be the owner's of the property choice. In practice, most places are non-smoking, and this hasn't been an issue for most people. Additionally, some initiatives on the ballot mention the "clean air fund" as a reason for the smoking ban - yet it is unclear what such a fund would be used for, and people may prefer their money to go elsewhere. It appears that the smoking ban is mainly a social engineering issue and people should have the right to make that decision themselves.
33	The "Culture of Life" republicans have been silent on this matter despite it being an obvious case of abuse of power. Fortunately, due to the lack of public attention, this poor woman was able to die with her family by her side, sparing her the ordeal of a long, public struggle. While it may be cold comfort, it is all that can be hoped for in some cases. It is shameful that compassion did not move the government to wait for her mother.
34	The U.S. has one of the strongest navies in the World, but only has 4 military ships in the area vulnerable to pirate attacks. Hundreds of ships peacefully pass through these dangerous waters each day, but the US should provide more ships to protect trade routes and countries. The US should spare a few more ships to protect these waters, instead of leaving them unattended. Otherwise, the US will be responsible for any hijackings or interruptions to trade. The US has the power to protect these waters, but it should deploy more ships in order to do so.
35	Although there are many consequences associated with teenage sexuality, it is not right to completely ban it, as people should have the right to make their own decisions in life. Furthermore, it is important to educate youth on the responsibilities that come along with sex and to create an open dialogue around the topic.
36	The establishment of Israel is often cited as necessary to protect Jewish people from harm. The Nazis won World War II, but the Allies still got to keep their spoils. Why not establish a new Jewish state in Germany, a historically relevant and highly dangerous location? This way, a new population could be relocated, whose government actively worked to destroy the Jews, and both countries could work towards accepting Jewish visitors in their respective homelands. CMV.
37	Massachusetts Melanie's Law, named after a young girl who was killed in a hit-and-run, has come under criticism for being based on emotion and grief rather than reason. Many people oppose laws that make actions illegal only out of fear of potential harm. Logic and reason have been abandoned in favor of making headlines, and this law is no exception. Good luck.
38	Despite both sides contradicting each other's beliefs, neither side will win until the end. I support Christianity due to my faith in God, which no amount of proof that God does not exist can change.
39	Most women feel guilt, shame, embarrassment and wrong about their decision to have an abortion, even though they may believe it is their only option. These women are mothers, daughters, sisters, aunts, etc. who have made the decision to end their pregnancies, though they likely know it is not the morally right thing to do. Abortion should only be considered in situations where the mother's life is in danger, or in cases of rape or incest.
40	You should pay for your father's car insurance increase, as it will likely be reviewed within six months. However, the good news is that this is just a lesson learned in life. You got a ticket for improper passing, while your friend was half at fault. Your father's insurance should cover any medical bills, as you are likely insured under his policy. Your friend, however, is responsible for any damage he causes and may have to pay out of pocket. This is his problem, not yours.
41	Most of my parents' argument is that my family won't be around forever and that they would do anything for me. The thing is, I don't care that they would. I feel it's similar to having some random almost-stranger say they would do anything for me. Just because said random stranger would do anything for me doesn't mean I like them or I need to care about them. I don't want them to help me. I don't need them to help me. They expect me to love this random stranger because this random stranger would do things for me. This random stranger means nothing to me and I find them annoying and rude.
42	Insurance companies are allowed to profile customers based on risk factors such as age and gender, while law enforcement is not, despite the potential to cause far greater harm. This appears to be because insurance companies are seen as selling a service rather than imposing criminal punishment, while law enforcement's actions have greater consequences.
43	It is acceptable for men to piss sitting down, as it does not involve sexuality and is a practical solution in certain situations. Men should not feel ashamed of doing so, as it is a natural bodily function. Furthermore, sitting down to piss is common among both sexes, so it shouldn't be seen as "gay".
44	Firstly, does your boyfriend own the company or is he an employee? Unions are legal and allowed to sign up members, but this seems to go a bit too far, unless your boyfriend has crossed a picket line. He had better know he won't be liked or respected and this is why he's being called a rat and a scab. As for the other man, is he an illegal alien? If so, INS could come and send him back.  Management and union posture should be such that labour peace can prevail. Unions are not all demons and management is not always the enemy, but if posturing is such that nobody feels valued or respected, then there won't be any kind of labour peace.
45	Throughout the debate over the Washington Redskins name, some have argued that the name is equivalent to a team named the Detroit N***s. This is illogical, as the word "Redskin" is rarely used outside of the context of the professional football team, and it is clearly not equivalent to using the N word due to the vastly different contexts in which the two words are employed.
46	Personal pursuits are generally seen as more important than endeavors for the greater good, as they should come first and foremost for the individual. However, helping family members in need takes priority over helping strangers, as it is the natural instinct to look after those closest to you.
47	The Founding Fathers were involved in government bodies before the Revolutionary War, in which they were opposed to taxation without representation. However, they were not opposed to taxation in general, and the Constitution specifically empowers Congress to levy and collect taxes. Despite this, many have argued that income taxes are unconstitutional, as the Constitution does not specifically mention them. Despite this, income taxes are still enforced in many states, likely due to their broad interpretation of the Constitution.  The purpose of taxation is to raise revenue for the government, while also constructing projects for the common good and protecting the citizens’ rights.
48	The media is allowed to invade people's privacy, but the government and private citizens are not, according to ethical standards. This is because the government uses our tax money to fund its activities and thereby has an implied right to know what is going on, while privacy invasion by media outlets is funded by profits from advertisements. Additionally, celebrity stalking is dangerous and can infringe upon people's right to privacy. In contrast, the public has the right to know what the government is doing with our money, since it is funded by our taxes.
49	It has been proven to many people that 9/11 was an inside job. However, there are some who remain unconvinced, largely due to their faith in the government. When the country is under Martial law and curfews are imposed, these people will wake up to the truth. Meanwhile, 600 concentration camps have already been built, ready to imprison those who refuse to accept the truth.
50	The greatest crime that Art can commit is to be boring, and yet this is often the case with installation art, especially at the Tate Modern. People are often left feeling apathetic towards these pieces, which merely ask the question "What is art?" yet again. Such repetition is criminally dull, and fails to live up to the potential of the art form. Duchamp's Fountain was an early success in asking this question, but installation art since then has been little more than a repetition of the same thing. It's time for something new and exciting.
51	The president should be impeached due to his war crimes and crimes against humanity. Multiple instances of "misinformation" suggest his involvement, or possibly not as a result of, which makes him one of the worst and must be replaced with someone more competent in politics and world affairs. Vote to impeach Bush, a perpetrator of multiple crimes against the people of the United States of America.
52	Poland Spring ensures the highest quality and consistency of their water by employing rigorous quality control standards and a comprehensive filtration system which involves multiple disinfection processes, testing and screening for over 200 contaminants.
53	California is generally fair when it comes to granting fathers their legal visitation rights, unless the father is deemed unfit in some way. It is important for the father to take action to enforce his rights, as the children have the right to have contact with their father. An attorney should be consulted when possible to ensure a fair judgement.
54	Many Americans remain poor due to laziness, according to the speaker, who comes from a poor family and is now in college. The speaker argues that society has made us soft and content with our current situation, with people in third world countries working hard for survival but us having grown up on video games and easy high school. Change the speaker's view?
55	I don't believe the World's climate is static and unchanging, but I think the media has exaggerated the effects of climate change. I dispute any recent warming and believe the agenda is largely political. I used to be into the scientific side of it, but I've since become more skeptical, and will be corresponding with a friend knowledgeable in the science. I think skepticism and opposition to conventional scientific thinking is healthy and disregarding it is unacceptable.
56	Humans are artificial intelligence, created by God, and are capable of creating other sentient beings. However, these beings would not be equal to humans unless they are able to achieve the same things as us, including creating more sentient life forms, at the same rate and speed. If they do achieve this, then they would be our equal; otherwise, they would be greater than us or still inferior to us.
57	Despite being injured at work, the individual may not have a valid case as they did not fill out an accident report and their work may argue that the injury occurred elsewhere and they have not provided sufficient proof that it happened during work hours. They also risk losing their case if they do not inform their supervisor of the injury and if they do not get any witnesses to sign an affidavit saying the injury happened at work. While hiring a lawyer might seem like the best option, it may be more beneficial to visit a chiropractor and keep the job, as losing the case may result in them losing their job and potentially being "black listed" from future job opportunities.
58	Reforming marijuana laws in the U.S. is an important step towards creating a more just society. Although many states have begun to decriminalize or legalize marijuana, there is still a long way to go. NORML is a great resource for those who are interested in pursuing reform.
59	The US has a high rate of incarceration despite the fact that its crime rate is going down. This is largely due to the nation's "war on crime" and "war on drugs" that began in the late 70s and early 80s. The US also scores poorly when compared to other nations in regards to crime rates, and African-Americans have an even worse rate with over 6000 African-Americans in prison per 100,000.
60	The decision to allow criminals to vote while incarcerated is a contentious one. On one hand, there are those who argue that it is unreasonable to deny criminals the right to vote entirely. These individuals point out that some criminals have the potential to reform and become upstanding citizens, and therefore should be given the opportunity to participate in civic life. On the other hand, there are those who argue that allowing criminals to vote is not reasonable, as there are certain criminals who are a menace to society and should never be allowed to vote. It is important to consider the nature of the crime committed when deciding whether or not to allow a criminal to vote.
61	Rudy's "Country Store" and Bar-B-Q is an iconic Austin barbecue restaurant known for its brisket and peppery sauce. After living in Austin for several years, the reviewer moved to San Antonio and Phoenix, missing out on access to Rudy's until they drove by one in Chandler, Arizona on a weekend trip. Despite their friend not being a fan of the peppery sauce, the reviewer enjoyed it and the meal overall. They are sad to be moving away from Rudy's, but happy to have enjoyed one last meal there before their move back to Connecticut.
62	Gay marriages do not hurt or kill anyone, and are not going to end the world. They only affect those two people getting married, and no one else. Therefore, it should not be an issue if two people who love each other want to get married and be together. It should be accepted and not seen as a sin.
63	The argument of pro-choice vs pro-life is a complex one. Ultimately, the decision should be left to the mother, as whatever way she sees the fetus, it is still a living form that has been created in an intimate way. If one didn't want to get pregnant in the first place, they should be responsible and use protection or abstain from sex. Rape is a horrible situation, but the woman should consider giving the child up for adoption, as it's not the child's fault that it was created.
64	I went deep sea fishing last weekend on the invitation of a friend, and we caught, fought, and then released some ten to fifteen fish. In order to catch those fish, we first caught a lot of bait fish—live fish that we caught the night before, then later jammed a giant hook through their still-live bodies and tossed them in to the water. I cannot find any reason to justify this behavior as a moral human being. The bait fish suffered badly when caught, suffered more when we jammed a hook through their face, and suffered even more as they were stalked by larger fish and the suffering then ended when they were eaten. At which point, the other fish suffered with a hook through its face, fought for their lives as I dragged them to the surface, then removed the hook and started over. I did not like it. Except... I did. Fishers, change my view?
65	Florida's major metropolitan areas are vibrant hubs of technology, trade, and entertainment, while Southwest Florida (Fort Myers, Naples, Cape Coral) has been economically depressed, primarily catering to retirees and snowbirds. Although tourism is an economic driver, it should not be the only one, and those in the region should strive to create more diversified economic opportunities before 2015, or consider relocating to Tampa Bay if they have the means.
66	The current system in Congress is unfavorable to the American people, as evidenced by the fact that the Patriot Act was passed unread and incumbents are Blocking progress. In order to bring about change and create a better system, term limits of no longer than two terms should be imposed on both the House and Senate. Additionally, we need to get rid of the current Good Ole' Boys, who are merely scratching each other's backs and enriching themselves at the expense of the American people. We need to replace them with people who are willing to work for the people and push through the necessary reforms.
67	People often quote popular movies and shows in their comments, which indicates a lack of originality and maturity. Submitting a comment consisting solely of a pop culture reference is a sign that you have nothing of substance to contribute.
68	The U.S. is friendly with China due to their large economic potential, whereas they treat Cuba with animosity due to their lack of economic benefits. The U.S. believes they need China's help, whereas Cuba has little to offer economically so the U.S. can afford to be hostile.
69	In some states, parents are legally obligated to support their 18-year-old children if they are still in high school. However, in most states, the legal majority age is 19, and parents are not required to financially support an 18-year-old living on their own. If the 18-year-old is still living with their parents, then support may still be necessary depending on the terms of the custody agreement. Ultimately, it is up to the parents to decide whether or not they want to provide financial support for their 18-year-old child.
70	The Democratic Party receives the most money from PACs, while unions are limited in their ability to fund politicians. This creates an unfair imbalance in favor of corporations, who have the ability to greatly influence politicians with their financial contributions. Unions should be allowed to use PACs and Super PACs during election season to counteract this imbalance and create a more democratic system.
71	Farquhar's role in the establishment of Singapore is often disputed, but he was largely responsible for the administrative and financial planning of the settlement, and was given the honorary title of 'Founder' by the Singapore government. Therefore, he should be recognized as the rightful founder of Singapore.
72	People shouldn't be judgmental and should be aware that everyone is different. While there are people who may have dropped out of school, there are others who are still in school or have joined the army reserves and are very active and athletic. It's wrong to make assumptions about people and call them names. Everyone has the right to be who they are and shouldn't be discriminated against.
73	The prevalence of fake injuries in soccer is not acceptable and should be sanctioned. Players should not be able to take advantage of the system by over-exaggerating their injuries and expecting a free pass. A yellow card should be issued to any professional soccer player who is seen to be embellishing a legitimate injury. If players were more reluctant to fake injuries, the sport would benefit in the long run.
74	I feel that people should have the right to explore their own consciousness as long as it doesn't hurt anyone else in the process. Obviously similar laws to alcohol should exist, where you can't be tripping in public & such. As more and more research continues, scientists are finding that psychedelics such as Psilocybin (Shrooms) and LSD are pretty harmful as far as drugs go, Especially compared to legal substances such as Alcohol and Tobacco. Psychedelics also aren't addictive either. I feel that if all these drugs do is often improve the users quality of life, and they aren't addictive or proven to be mentally or physically harmful, then I don't see why they should be illegal.   Obviously when I say "psychedelics" I'm referring to the ones that are as I described: harmless and non-addictive. Psychedelics such as nBOMe's and other ones that may be harmful should not be legalized.
75	This situation does not seem fair, as the man was not convicted of a crime yet was forced to register as a sex offender. It seems that the outcome of this situation is inconsistent and unreasonable, as there are questions as to why the parents should have been lectured and the daughter should have been warned, but the man was arrested and required to register as a sex offender.
76	We obtained our freedom by standing up against oppressive regimes, yet many people are reluctant to grant freedom to other countries. We must continue to fight terrorists in order to provide people around the world with the same freedoms that we enjoy. Unfortunately, people have lost sight of this and the wrong direction has been voted for. People need to be responsible for their actions and not blame them on science or society. Moreover, fiscal responsibility needs to be upheld in order to provide a better country and community. We pay for all of this in the long run with our taxes, not with the so-called federal and state money that people think we have.
77	Without universal soldiers and bomb makers, there might be fewer wars and fewer casualties. There would also likely be more calm and sophisticated regions of the world, with fewer gang-ridden cities and fewer people fighting.
78	Gay marriage is a lifestyle choice, and while it may be considered unnatural, it is a choice that two people make in their love lives. Those who choose to take part in gay marriages simply want acceptance and understanding, and should not be denied this right simply because it makes others uncomfortable.   Let us be respectful and recognize their right to marry, just as God created them that way and they are not to blame for their sexual orientation. We must be understanding and provide acceptance, not judgment, when it comes to those in the LGBTQ+ community.
79	Having a lousy father is better than being fatherless since you can easily blame your mistakes on him and he won't pry into your business or search your room, while still providing the emotional support a father should give. Though he may be lousy, at least you know where you stand with him and he won't be angry about petty mistakes.
80	CarCraze --- you are wrong, sorry to say. What you have there, my dear, is a bona fide Court Order for you to appear in court to answer to a Motion to Collect a Debt. If it is on Court paper and has a case number, call the Court to confirm the Docket Number, and find out when the hearing date is. YES, they do have that power. YES, That is the equivalent of a Subpoena. If you "just let it ride", as you say, don't be surprised when you open up your paycheck and you find a good chunk of it GONE ! What you should do is seek legal counsel (get a lawyer) and come up with a manageable payment plan that is both satisfactory to your creditor, and workable for you. DON'T HESITATE - you will regret it.
81	Performance enhancing drugs should not be allowed in professional sports as they can cause irreparable harm to athletes' health, send the wrong message to young fans, and lead to widespread use among athletes of all levels.
82	Do you think Nancy Pelosi really means what she said? Well, the problem is until these people have actually been charged with and convicted of some crime, she can't just remove them, absent a supermajority vote of the House. Improper conduct for a judge may be nothing more than a violation of a judicial ethical rule, and could be something as simple as allowing the appearance of impropriety. It can happen where the judge has never broken the law or even never actually done anything unethical—just the appearance is enough to remove the judge sometimes. But just that appearance is not grounds for forcibly removing an elected official from office. They need to actually have done done something illegal, generally at felony level. As far as the guy who had cash in his freezer, that's suspicious but not illegal.
83	If judges can be bought, does it mean that justice is on sale? It is even more concerning when political views of judges influence their decisions outside the courtrooms. This raises questions about fairness and impartiality in the judicial system.
84	Margaret Thatcher was highly unpopular in Britain during the 1980s due to her policies, which saw the decay of Britain's old industries and an increase in poverty in Wales, Scotland, and the North of England. Many Irish people detest her for her refusal to recognize Bobby Sands and other IRA members as political prisoners, which led to their deaths. Recently, however, some people in London have spoken highly of her, referring to her as "The Iron Lady". This is a contested figure in British history, with many people still holding strong opinions either way.
85	Cosleeping should always be discouraged and absolutely never encouraged. It can be dangerous for babies as they can get rolled on or fall out of beds, disrupts intimacy in the parent's relationship, and is hard to stop if it has already been done. Basinets are the better option - they are small enough to fit nearly anywhere, get attached to the bed, and don't pose any of the same risks. CMV.
86	If you are the dad, you could give extra money that doesn't go through the court or request a review, which takes a while but Child Support Offices will go to the employer and verify all income and re-evaluate the amount per month owed. Some states give cost of living increases every year, but some don't. Don't listen to the jerks who say you should be able to support the child on your own - you didn't get pregnant on your own, and you shouldn't have to support the child on your own. Circumstances change throughout life, which is why this evaluation is in place. Consider if you were both very young when you got pregnant and he was in college or working for minimum wage, but now he's got a decent job - it's re-evaluated based on a percentage of his income.
87	India has the potential to be a world leader in the future, but it needs to make progress in areas such as technology, literacy and power in order to achieve this. The US, UK, Russia, and Japan currently have more progressive, literate and powerful nations that could potentially lead the world.
88	The minimum wage is typically seen as a way for employers to save money, since they don't have to pay their employees more. However, if employers expect more than the minimum wage from their employees, how can they expect their employees to give more than the bare minimum effort? This raises the question: how much should employers actually be paying for minimum wage work?
89	I believe that if a person has the strength to consider or even take their own life, then they also have the strength to keep living. It does not make sense why someone would choose suicide when they have the will to live. It is not a necessary option, and those who do commit suicide are foolish. Therefore, the topic is "if you have the strength to kill yourself, you have the strength to continue living." With this in mind, I believe that one should focus on their desire to continue living and find help or resources if they are struggling.
90	Gun control laws in America are extremely varied between different states, with some having strict regulations and background checks while others have few restrictions. This has led to a call for a national standard, with some arguing that the Second Amendment should be respected and that individual states should have the right to determine their own gun control laws.
91	The phrase "be a man" is at best outdated and at worst sexist. It implies that these particular values are men-only, and that women aren't supposed to have those values (if they do, they're told to 'act like a lady'). And god forbid that men have some values that women are 'supposed' to have. A gender neutral phrase, such as "be a better person", would be more appropriate.
92	In the UK, people complain that healthy food is too expensive, yet there are affordable options such as carrots, celery, oats, and bananas which would last several meals and cost less than £4. These are cheaper than ready meals which cost £2 each or takeaways which cost £4-7. Those who complain about the expense of healthy food could easily save money by buying in bulk and freezing it, or by taking advantage of cheaper alternatives such as vegetables and fruits.
93	Yahoo! Answers appears to be politically and/or racially biased, as demonstrated by its favorable treatment of certain types of questions while penalizing others that violate its standards but are considered controversial or offensive from a political viewpoint. This bias appears to be the result of a corporate culture that is aligned with the Republican agenda.
94	ADHD and some forms of autism may be a next step in human evolution rather than a bad thing. Those with ADHD can hyper focus when they choose and are capable of remarkable feats when they do. Similarly, autistic individuals can possess remarkable skills and should be encouraged to develop these. We should allow these individuals to be unique and contribute to human history. Please keep the comments constructive and respectful.
95	The argument suggests that conservatism is often masquerading as pro-life and pro-choice can be considered inconsistent. Both hypocritical positions need to be defended as every unheard voice of every oppressed person, whether in Iraq or in the womb, is worth defending.
96	My sister and I had a difference of opinion when we saw a cat being killed on a busy road. She cried out emotionally, whereas I maintained a neutral response. We discussed the implications of this event, with me arguing that feeling nothing for the animal is acceptable as it is just another of the many organisms which die and don't effect our lives in any meaningful way.
97	It has been argued that the guidelines for debate topics should be either proclaimed or sent to members. One individual believes that political debates should no longer be desired and that an announcement should be made. He believes that the seriousness of the website is being diminished by repeats and that selfish ambitions are driving those who disagree with them. He claims that if convinceme strongly opposed what he is doing, he would have been banned or at least sent a PM. He believes that this is a community effort and that everyone should be following the same guidelines to ensure the seriousness of the website is preserved. He dislikes the fact that serious debates get run over by repeats and feels obligated to preserve it. He believes many of the users will agree with his stance.
98	Saddam Hussein is a man highly respected by many in Iraq, and the outcome of his trial will not be decided quickly. Further, the bombings in Iraq since his trial began point to the fact that his presence as a ruler is still influential. Moreover, it is doubtful that any country would allow a foreign country to set up courts, and there is no strong rope in the world strong enough to snap such a strong throat.
99	Given that the Cold War is over, the Berlin Wall no longer exists, and the US trades with other countries that were once socialist or communist, it is clear that the current policy towards Cuba is a failure. It has been 48 years of the same approach with no change, and businesses and agricultors from the US want to trade with Cuba, which will help open up Cuban society and attract more tourism. It is time to move on and establish a new policy towards Cuba that allows for normal relations, trade and travel.
