0	Climate change does not exist, as indicated by sources such as the top 10 reasons listed on globalclimatescam.com, facts about the "global warming" hoax from newsmax.com, and information about the conspiracy from en.wikipedia.org.
1	A scientific consensus exists on the reality of anthropogenic climate change. Man-made climate change has already claimed human lives and continues to do so. The consensus that humans are causing recent global warming is shared by 90-100% of publishing climate scientists, according to six independent studies. Those results are consistent with the 97% consensus reported by Cook et al.
2	The scientific consensus is that climate change is happening and it is caused by human activities. 97% of scientists agree that climate change is primarily human-caused. Any arguments presented by climate change deniers are not backed by facts and are likely to be unsuccessful.
3	There is an overwhelming scientific consensus that climate change presents a serious risk to the future of the Earth and to mankind. Many of the threats we face due to climate change are insidious, while others may not be noticed by deniers. These risks include the spread of potentially lethal diseases such as that caused by the Zika virus, as well as the spread of diseases formerly confined to the tropics across North America and Europe. Climate change is being caused by human activity, and it is not within the scope of free speech to violate the 1st Amendment in order to fight against it. Some instances of speech can be restricted, such as child pornography, as it presents a real and serious risk to children. The harms caused by climate change deniers, who do so for greed, are of such magnitude that more speech is not adequate or sufficient. It is better to restrict the speech of those who propogate ignorance. Furthermore, children will be the most affected by the adverse effects of climate change, and will include teenagers sent to fight the increasing number of wars and conflicts. If need be, yes, jailing people who write and utter falsehoods about climate change should be considered.
4	Climate change is a real and present threat, with human activity being the main contributor to global warming. Humanity faces an enormous challenge in combating climate change, but the overwhelming majority of scientists agree that it is occurring and that the rate of warming is unprecedented. Claims of it being a fraud therefore require strong evidence and a high burden of proof.
5	The climate is not changing, and the local weather may change but the global climate stays basically the same. The oceans are not rising either. The IPCC is not a communist organization and does not have communist agendas. You can and should trust any scientist who tells you that the climate is changing. This person may have a secret agenda that has nothing to do with climate change. I propose that climate change is real and that the people who oppose it are all frauds and charlatans. The science of human-caused climate change is sound and full of accurate facts and evidence. There is proof that climate change is caused by human activity and not natural fluctuations. Video evidence - The In-depth Story Behind A Climate Fraud. 97% consensus fraud. It's impossible and against the laws of physics that a tiny human mass can affect the huge Earth mass. Maurice Strong is a fraudulent individual who fled to China to hide from the global police. 4. CO2 reaches its saturation point at 80 parts / million and does not reflect any significant amount of heat. 5. Tree rings are not an accurate measurement of temperature. "Hide the decline" email by Phil Jones. "Mike's trick". Hockey stick nonsense. Inverted graphs. Etc. There, That should keep you busy for a while. Refute all these points. Good luck.
6	Climate change is real and not a hoax. This is evidenced by increased carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere, which are directly proportional to human industrial activity, and are accompanied by a rise in temperature. Additionally, Arctic sea ice is shrinking, and polar bears may face their first iceless summer by 2050.
7	Climate change is a fraud, perpetuated by Obama and his crew, according to this argument. The science behind it is faulty and full of misconceptions and bad science.   There is evidence to suggest that the entire topic is fake news, from the In-depth Story Behind A Climate Fraud video, as well as the 97% consensus fraud, and the properties of CO2 not being able to create global warming on the scale indicated by scientists.   Furthermore, Maurice Strong was found to be corrupt and fled to China to hide from the global police, as well as Climate data fraud, Tree rings not being an accurate measurement of temperature, and the Hide the Decline and Mike's trick emails from the Phil Jones and the Hockey stick nonsense.
8	The task at hand is to contend that anthropogenic climate change is non-existent. From a common definition, anthropogenic means relating to, or resulting from the influence of human beings on nature. Then, from common usage, "climate change" means a harmful rise in global temperature. This could be a difficult task. The Earth's atmosphere is 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, 0.9% argon, and 0.1% trace gases including CO2. Assume (for this paragraph only) that the small trace gas of CO2 (0.04%) is the cause of global warming. The focus here will be upon sources of CO2 emissions both natural and manmade. The source emissions of CO2 would by a most rational people be the cause of global warming. According to the IPCC, 800 gigatons of CO2 is emitted into the atmosphere from nature and man, annually. Most rational people would consider a source that is more than 51% to be the cause of a problem. Some irrational people might try to argue that 33% would be a threshold for cause. Only, crazy people would state that something that is less than 5% could be consider the cause. That brings us to the percent of total CO2 emissions from mankind. That percent of CO2 emissions is 3.62% (29 from man of 800 total gigatons)! This 3.62% can not be the cause of global warming. Now, questioning if CO2 is the cause of global warming. The alarmist side uses thresholds in parts per million (PPM). 400 PPM sounds scary and 0.04% is at an insanely small amount, both numbers are the same. Imagine, how quick the alarmists arguments would be dismissed if they said that 0.04% of atmospheric gases drove global climate. Then if combined with only 3.6% of annual CO2 emissions is from man, this is an incredibly small number that man is responsible for. Using just common sense methods, it becomes very hard to believe claims made by alarmists. Anyone attempting to say 3.6% is the cause of a problem would be laughed at. Especially, when the gas in question is exhaled by each one of us. The real reasons for climate change to be anthropogenic is political and financial. Just federal grants for climate change related projects is greater than $10 billion. Scientists are just as financially motivated as anyone else. A climate scientist that is outside of the mainstream will not be funded. This creates incentives to stay in agreement with those in political power. Anthropogenic climate change as a political issue is perfect for oppressive progressive politicians. The solutions to this false issue are more governmental control over the daily lives of harmless people. The politicians have scientist by the purse strings, this ensures compliance. This debate is about causes not effects, thus positive and negative impacts will not be addressed.
9	Climate change is an ongoing political debate that has been masquerading as a scientific one. A consensus among 97% of scientists agrees that climate change is happening and caused by humans burning fossil fuels, resulting in high levels of CO2 in the atmosphere. This has been confirmed by multiple lines of evidence, including increased temperatures, melting glaciers, and decreased mass. Additionally, the burning of fossil fuels is the main cause of the rapid climate change that is occurring.
10	Feminism is a social movement that advocates for equal rights and opportunities for women. There are different branches of feminism, such as Antiporn, Cultural, Hip Hop, Lesbian, Queer and Radical feminism, which all have different views and approaches on how to achieve equal rights for women. The main argument of this debate is that feminism has gone too far, yet before we can continue, it is important to define exactly what kind of feminism the opponent disagrees with. The Pink Hat movement is an example of a branch of feminism that promotes gender equality and the devaluation of gender roles. Thus, this movement stands for women's rights, autonomy and empowerment. It is up to the opponent to show that this movement has gone too far in achieving these goals.
11	Feminism has no gender; it is the advocacy of gender equality and the promotion of women's rights. It is not limited to females, but encompasses all individuals who support these ideals.
12	Con has argued that dictionaries do not authoritatively define words, but has given no proof of this. Con's only argument in the entire debate is that "Since 'masculinism' is male supremacy, then feminism is female supremacy." without giving any evidence to back the claim that words with similar roots cannot have different meanings. Furthermore, Con has not provided any source of definition for Masculinism, so Con's argument is not sound.   On the other hand, I have offered six authoritative sources stating that Feminism is the movement for equality between men and women. I am for equality between men and women, and am thus for Feminism. Con claims to be an "equalist" and to support the rights of both men and women, meaning Con is also for Feminism.  The statement of debate is "Feminism". I have proven I am Pro, and have also disproved Con's argument that dictionaries do not define words authoritatively.
13	Feminism is the advocacy for social, political, and economic equality for women, which is something you agree with. Your disagreement seems to stem from how feminists go about accomplishing this. You claim that feminists are stereotyping men as bad and encourage false rape accusations, however, that is not what feminism is at all. 60% of victims report abuse, and 97% of abusers will not see jail[8]. Only 1.5-8% of rape reports are fake[9], so Puh-LEASE do not try and say that considerable amount of rape reports are fake and that we should cast doubt on those few that come forward. If we are going of the definition of feminism I stated earlier, then feminists aren't trying to put men as stereotypically bad. We are trying to make men and women equal. If you think that trying to remove the bias towards men is trying to say they are bad, then I am going to have to ask you go to timeout because that idea is downright childish. In the end there you say something about "calling the police about something ridiculous is obscure". I think you mean absurd, but if you didn't then I'm not sure what that would mean. If it is obscure, then false rape accusations don't happen often and thus shouldn't be a problem. If you meant absurd, then I would agree that false rape accusations are deplorable, but again I would say that "false rape reports" is not a tenant of feminism nor is it a likely to occur.
14	Feminism is an ongoing movement that strives to achieve equal rights and opportunities for women, regardless of their geographical location. Although there have been great advancements in recent years, feminism is still necessary in many places around the world. It is unfortunate that the opponent refused to respond to the argument, as their concession implies that feminism is still needed in many places. Furthermore, the opponent failed to refute any of my sources, which shows that feminism is still an essential movement to spread equality throughout the world.
15	Feminism is needed in some countries where women are oppressed and have little rights, but slow progressive changes must be made first to address each conflict differently in order to prevent mass revolts that could lead to a rebellion. Feminism has been successfully established in 1st world countries like the US, but first democracy and peace must reach these areas.
16	Feminism has evolved over the years, with third wave feminism challenging traditional ideas about gender roles and modern feminism advocating for equal rights and opportunities for women. Despite this, modern feminism has been criticized for promoting an agenda that is damaging to men. Moreover, modern feminism is largely responsible for increased animosity between the sexes, as it leads to an attitude of revenge rather than cooperation and understanding. In the 19th century, many states denied women the right to vote, which was a wrong that needed to be rectified. However, attributing this injustice to all men born two centuries after the fact is invalid. While it is true that women generally do not possess the same physical strength as men, this is more a result of biological differences rather than social conditioning and disparities in opportunities. The Declaration of Independence did not phrase its statement about “all men” in terms of gender, but in terms of citizenship, making this argument invalid. In sum, modern feminism is damaging to the relations between the sexes and is largely responsible for the increased bitterness between them.
17	Hi everyone,  I'm Ilan and I believe that everyone should be treated equally regardless of gender. However, I am not a feminist because I do not believe in feminism's definition of equality. Feminism advocates for women's rights, which is only focused on helping women, not men. Men face many of the same issues as women, such as prostate cancer, yet only half the funding goes towards research and cures. Additionally, MRA’s (Men’s Rights Activists) have been advocating for men’s issues for decades but still, feminism does not recognize it as a priority.  I am an egalitarian, who believes that everyone should be treated equally regardless of gender. However, I want to make it clear that I am not a feminist.
18	Feminism is an advocacy of women’s rights on the grounds of political, social, and economic equality to men. Pro acknowledged that feminism promotes equal rights for women, and did not refute any of Con's advantages of feminism, meaning Con has made a successful case for why Pro's position on feminism should be rejected.
19	Feminism today is twisted and hypocritical, so it is best to abandon it. I am for the rights of men and women, not just women, and not only men.
20	Mother Teresa once said that “the greatest destroyer of peace is abortion”, as it can lead to a spiral of vengeance and violence. While abortion is currently legal in many countries, it should still be approached with caution as it carries risks for the mother and could lead to psychological trauma. Furthermore, the sentiments of many people around the world suggest that it should remain illegal due to its perceived lack of safety and the protection it provides for unborn babies.
21	My opponent has argued against many forms of abortion on moral grounds, which is his prerogative, however it is important to remember that abortion has many uses beyond the moral. It is important to ensure that abortion remains an option in cases such as rape and incest, to save the mother's life, or in cases of severe foetal abnormality. It should be noted that abortion is not a "one size fits all" solution and that in many cases alternatives such as adoption are preferable. Overall, my opponent's argument against many forms of abortion is incomplete as it fails to acknowledge the utility of abortion in certain cases, and fails to provide a comprehensive argument as to why abortion should be outlawed in all cases.
22	Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy either by induced or spontaneous means, resulting in the death of a fetus or embryo. Some people believe that abortion is justifiable in certain cases, while others consider it akin to murder and should be illegal. Those in favor of legalized abortion point to the right to privacy and the potential risk to the mother's health, while opponents argue that abortion goes against their religious or moral beliefs. Ultimately, the legality and ethics of abortion remain a highly contested issue.
23	Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by the removal or expulsion from the uterus of a fetus or embryo. An abortion can occur spontaneously or be induced. In humans, an abortion induced to preserve the health of the gravid is termed a therapeutic abortion, while an abortion induced for any other reason is termed an elective abortion. The term abortion most commonly refers to the induced abortion of a human pregnancy, while spontaneous abortions are usually termed miscarriages.   Do you believe in torturing terrorists? If the answer is no, you are a moron because you believe in killing gods perfectly harmless creations for nothing, and not killing a terrorist for terrorizing our country. Do you believe in the death sentence? If you said no, your killing a baby for Nothing. Yes, you are killing it - you stop its heart from beating, and that is considered murder in the eyes of god and Jesus, our lord and savior. What do you think god and Jesus think about that? If you are an atheist, please Google john 3:16.
24	Abortion is a controversial topic that divides people into two camps: those who believe it should be legal in some or all cases, and those who believe it should be illegal in all cases. Some people think that abortion should be legal in cases of rape or incest, while others believe it should not. Others believe that abortion should be legal up until a certain point in the pregnancy, while others believe that abortion should be illegal at all points in the pregnancy. Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to legalize abortion lies with each country's laws and citizens.
25	Abortion is needed to control the population and prevent it from growing excessively. If our country stops allowing abortion, it could lead to a situation similar to that of China, where women are forced to undergo abortions against their will, leading to an increase in the suicide rate. Men have a higher rate of suicide in countries where abortion is illegal due to this forceful practice. By keeping abortion legal, we can prevent the population from growing out of control and protect women's rights.
26	The act of abortion can be classified as either moral or immoral depending on the person's opinion and the circumstances of the case. While some consider abortion as a form of assault, others may recognize it as a woman's right to choose. Either way, the topic of abortion should be considered from both sides and given the respect and attention it deserves. Ultimately, the decision should be made by the woman who has to endure the consequences of her decision.
27	Abortion is a controversial topic, with both sides presenting valid arguments. Con has argued that restricting abortion would force women to pay for their own abortions and would enslave them into doing so, while pro-choice advocates argue that denying abortion access would create an economic burden on families and increase the number of unadopted orphans. Con has countered that technology is moving us away from jobs and that overpopulation is a real threat. Ultimately, the decision of whether to allow or restrict abortion lies with the government, and the effects of either decision on the economy and women’s rights should be taken into consideration.
28	Despite the emotional and widespread opinion to the contrary, research has shown that making abortion illegal does not reduce abortion, but instead increases maternal mortality. The decision to take on the risk of pregnancy should be left to the pregnant person themselves, as women's lives, health, and basic human rights depend on the availability of abortion.
29	This isn't your typical abortion debate. Because I've never been pregnant, nor do I remember my fetus days, I don't consider myself fit to judge whether abortion is right or wrong. However, I believe that the morality of abortion should be determined by whether or not a fetus is sentient.
30	Trump does not meet the requirements for life, thus making the statement "trump is life" false. It does not maintain balanced conditions in its inner structure, show adaptation to the environment, or have metabolism, growth, or reproduction capabilities.
31	Donald Trump's racist rhetoric is dangerous and destructive. It incites hatred, causes mistrust, and destroys communities. His words will only lead to more crime and division in the US, and should never be supported.
32	Trump is planning to build a great wall on our southern border between the U.S. and Mexico, and he has promised to make Mexico pay for it. He also plans to put an end to President Obama's illegal executive order on immigration. Additionally, he has said he will bring back jobs from China, Japan and Mexico, as well as bring back American money and make the American dream available again. He believes this will make him the greatest president of all time.
33	Mr. Trump has generated controversy since his presidential campaign with his views on immigration and his plan to build a wall between the United States and Mexico. He has been criticized for his inconsistent statements, as well as his inability to back up his opinions with facts. Despite this, his supporters believe that he will make a great president.
34	Trump's stance on immigration could cause a rise in racism and the death of innocent people due to Minuteman-inspired groups, so it is negligent to vote for him.
35	Donald Trump has changed his stance on various policies and has donated money to both the Clintons and Rand Paul. He does not appear to be particularly religious and does not ask for forgiveness from God. Trump has been open to different healthcare systems, including universal healthcare in the past and now supports a 100% free market system. He has also supported the Clintons in the past and is seen as evidence of Washington's corruption.
36	No one will be tougher on ISIS than Donald Trump, as he is not afraid to speak his mind and has proven himself to be a great negotiator. Moreover, Trump is not politically correct and will voice his opinions directly, something that is lacking in many politicians.
37	In order to be elected as President of the World, a candidate must possess a Trump Card of a certain suit. However, the lack of a concrete resolution makes it difficult to define exactly what this Trump Card should entail.
38	In round 2, I demolished everyone's source that Trump is a liar: WashPo's list is full of clearly non-lies. Probably nothing on their list is a real lie. My opponent's Round 2 response was just a rehash of his Round 1 rant. So, I will respond to some of the side comments.  Says who? Does WashPo have a tracker for Obama's lies, Bush's lies, Clinton's lies? -Nope. We can't know how his lying compares without having comparable lists.   This is my exact point: Trump is just another one of the everyone that lie. Why should his lies be tracked when no one else's have been? I assert that Trump doesn't lie in a manner worthy of special tracking. His lack of complete honesty is in line with the mainstream of US politicians and media outlets nowadays.
39	Sadly, the American Dream is dead, according to Donald Trump. However, it isn't yet, and if he wins the election, it could be in danger. Hillary Clinton claims Trump is a racist and he responds by lying and making excuses. Trump has been shown to be untruthful in a vast majority of his statements and is unfit to lead the country.
40	Con argued that a Brexit will have mostly negative effects, and Pro provided no rebuttal to these claims. Unless Pro provides an adequate rebuttal in later rounds, Con has conceded that Brexit will have mostly negative effects. Additionally, Pro had the burden of proof to show that Brexit will have mostly positive effects, however, they failed to provide any evidence to support this. As such, it is assumed that Pro will not be able to successfully prove that Brexit will have mostly positive effects, and as such Con has won the debate.
41	The Leave side had claims of irrational fear of immigration and a possible loss of autonomy, but the facts show that Britain's Membership in the EU costs around 6.3 billion pounds, or 0.3% of the country's GDP. For economics to be superior, leaving the EU would have to affect the UK by more than 0.3%, but considering that Britain makes 13% of its GDP from selling commodities to the EU, this seems unlikely. Furthermore, economists predict that Britain could lose up to 6% of its GDP from leaving the EU, much greater than 0.3%. Additionally, the UK would lose access to the EU's free trade deals, as well as having to pay tariffs that would amount to close to the cost of EU membership after free trade deals are abolished. This would affect the economy in a negative way. Moreover, Britain has complete control of its immigration policy, yet limiting immigration radically could have some pernicious effects. Moreover, 70% of Britain's population increase came from immigration, meaning that limiting immigration drastically could be damaging. Clearly, the emotional appeal of Brexit would not get them far, as the facts show that leaving the EU would accomplish nothing in the area of immigration, and would hurt the UK economy in the long run.
42	England will benefit from Brexit because they can close their border to migrants, control illegal immigration from the Middle East, save money on EU fees, and maintain independence. Switzerland and Norway are successful non-EU countries which run their own affairs without having to follow EU rules. Borders are important to protect countries from unwanted migration and Brexit will enable England to do this. The European Union is not a successful political entity, as the Ottoman and Roman Empires have shown, and England should stay independent and not be part of it.
43	England should remain independent and not be part of the European Union due to the migrant crisis and the increased risk of terrorism. Switzerland and Norway have both remained independent countries and prospered, and the British people should have the same opportunity.
44	Britain must exit from the EU in order to regain full control over its economic and immigration policies, as well as to preserve its independent standing in the world. Furthermore, leaving the EU would provide the opportunity to forge new and improved relationships with countries outside of Europe, such as the United States and those in the Commonwealth. The rising cost of EU membership fees coupled with the continually increasing costs of remaining in the EU make it clear that Britain must take the necessary steps to leave the Union.
45	My opponent seems to be missing the point. I'm not saying one shouldn't use sources. What I'm saying is that when you do use a source, you need to use quotation marks, and reference your source. If you don't, you're guilty of plagiarism. Sources: 1. https://logfall.wordpress.com... 2. http://m.economictimes.com... 3. Ibid
46	The people of England are facing challenges due to immigration and rising unemployment, leading to a decrease in living standards. To remedy this, it is important to consider the effects of Brexit on new industries, employment, and international trade. This can provide more job opportunities and better living standards for the people of England.
47	After two years of negotiations, Britain's membership of the European Union remains uncertain. Both sides of the debate have presented evidence that suggests their view is more economically beneficial for Britain. However, the two sides have been unable to come to a consensus and it is unlikely that the outcome of Brexit will be decided within the two year timeline. Therefore, the decision should be left to the people of Britain through a referendum. With a trial period of independence, Britain can continue to trade with the European Union while also negotiating individual trade agreements with other countries, giving Britain more control over its own future.
48	The UK is uniquely positioned to become an independent, self-sufficient nation, according to the source provided by the debater. The source, which is the EU Constitution, outlines how the UK can gain independence and thrive on its own. Despite the opponent's claims, the debater's evidence is reliable and well-presented, as evidenced by the sources provided. They have adamantly argued in favour of a more independent UK, and have shown that independence has always led to self-sufficiency in the past. Ultimately, the debater believes in the UK's ability to become an independent, successful nation, and their belief in this is unwavering.
49	The death penalty is extremely expensive and does not deter crime. There have been many cases of innocent people being executed, which makes the death penalty unethical. Additionally, states that do not have the death penalty tend to have lower crime rates. Therefore, the death penalty should not be implemented.
50	The death penalty is often seen as a way to protect society from dangerous criminals, however it carries the risk of innocent people being executed. It is also more expensive than life in prison without parole, according to evidence presented by Dudley Sharp, Death Penalty Resources Director of Justice For All (JFA). JFA estimates that life without parole cases will cost $1.2 million - $3.6 million more than equivalent death penalty cases. Over time, equivalent life without parole cases are much more expensive than death penalty cases.
51	The death penalty deters crime and serves as an effective deterrent to murder, as seen in states that have implemented it. Additionally, it is more cost effective than housing a prisoner for life and can help reduce costs related to housing and feeding prisoners. Removing the death penalty will have negative effects, such as an increase in crime rates and an increase in the number of appeals in the court system. Finally, the death penalty is morally justified and serves as a suitable punishment for those who have committed heinous crimes.
52	The death penalty has a purpose to deter future crimes and avenge the innocent lives lost. In contrast, not having the death penalty can cause overpopulation of criminals, increase crime rates, and cause citizens to be feared. The death penalty should be used to protect innocent lives and to keep crime rates down.
53	The death penalty is a good idea because it decreases the prison population, ensures that prisoners can't kill again, and is a deterrent to crime. The example of Kenneth Allen McDuff, who was released from death row and went on to kill again, demonstrates the efficacy of the death penalty as a deterrent. It is clear from the provided source that the death penalty is an effective form of punishment and should be implemented in more jurisdictions.
54	For the most part, these are correct, although there are some grey areas, but do not concern yourself with that. One mistake i made is that in some cases the death penalty is not COMPLETELY painless, but i was wanting to make the point that in most cases, it's less painful than a lot of deaths. "The death penalty is a misuse and waste of taxpayer dollars". So you are saying that sentencing someone to the death penalty uses to many tax payers dollars, so keeping them in prisons and feeding them three meals a day along with airconditioning and electricity saves money? How many families struggle to feed their families and keep the lights on, while criminals sit here in prisons for 30 years and have everything some families struggle for, for free, and thats fair? And that doesn't waste money? If a person is sentenced to life in prison at age 37, at age 77, on average, it will cost a state more than $4 million dollars. (http://www.phoenix.edu...) I would like an explanation on how the death penalty costs more. "Innocent people are too often executed". Please show me cases where people are wrongly executed in the last 20 years or so. The death penalty is not used nearly as much, so i would like some elabortation. "The death penalty is applied in an unfair manner". I must have elabortation on this also. Another point i must make, the death penalty is a source of intimidation. If someone kwows the death penalty is strictly enforced, more than likely that person will think twice about committing the crime. Its common sense, if someone understands that their life will be taken if they take someone else's life, less crimes will be committed. Now the death penalty is used more and more lightly and criminals know that more than likely nothing too terribly harmful will happen if they were to commit crimes. The justice system is becoming more and more relax and the death penalty is one example. My Dad is a police officer and even he states that the justice department is not punishing criminals the way criminals should be punished.
55	The death penalty is immoral because it allows a jury of 12 people to take life into their own hands, and the punishment is permanent and wrongful convictions can never be undone.
56	The death penalty is more expensive than housing an inmate for life, according to a report from the Death Penalty Information Center. The report states that at the trial level, death penalty cases generate roughly $470,000 in additional costs to the prosecution and defense over the cost of trying the same case as an aggravated murder without the death penalty. On direct appeal, the cost of appellate defense averages $100,000 more in death penalty cases, than in non-death penalty murder cases. Additionally, personal restraint petitions filed in death penalty cases cost an additional $137,000 in public defense costs. Furthermore, innocent people have been wrongly executed and that is an issue with the death penalty. As stated in the report, studies show that people kept away from other people go crazy and nuts, so the death penalty is not a suitable punishment. Life in prison is enough, since there is no guarantee that an inmate will ever be released, and studies show that life in prison is a worse punishment than death.
57	The majority of people in the United States support the death penalty, according to polls, and this proves that the public believes it to be an effective deterrent for crime. The death penalty also puts the public’s mind at ease, as it allows them to feel as though justice is being served. Additionally, the death penalty may be an appropriate punishment in cases where the prison system has failed, as in the case of the “Arpaio model” of punishment in America. Ultimately, the death penalty should remain an option, as it serves as a powerful deterrent and may help protect citizens from dangerous criminals.
58	The death penalty should not be used as it is ineffective at deterring crime, costs more than life imprisonment, and can lead to innocent people being executed. Life imprisonment provides the opportunity for rehabilitation and forgiveness, while also being more cost effective than the death penalty.
59	Google is slowly taking over the world by releasing products like Google Classroom and cars, which will make paper and documents obsolete. This will give them full control over what we do, what we buy, and even what we think. Their aim is to make us think like Google, and this is how they are accomplishing it.
60	Google receives more visitors than Bing, but that doesn't necessarily make it better. Bing is catching up as more people become aware of its existence, while its sounding better than Google may be a matter of personal preference. Tests showed that 33% of Google users would switch to Bing, which further supports the idea that people are open to using other search engines.
61	1 "Google is a reliable source" and "Google is true so pro must win" thus pro has the argument.  2 Con: google said unreliable so "reliable" not "reilable"; Con search prove "google not reilable" thus Con is wrong.  3 Con: logical contradiction If google not reliable I win but "this is an argument" thus Con has no evidence; All arguments must be supported by reputable sources thus "you can't trust con".  4 "Con is illuminati" thus "you can't trust con".
62	My opponent has failed to refute any point that I have made, indicating that he is conceding this debate. Additionally, he states that "if Google was really the best search engine then why would there be things such as this [i.e. inappropriate things]?" This implies that Google is not the most reliable search engine.
63	Google is often preferred by users over Bing, even though Bing may be better than Google in some respects. This is due to a cognitive "firewall" that users put up when defending their preferred search engine. Microsoft's "Bing It On" campaigns have proved that Bing is as good as, or better than, Google in a blind comparison test, but these results are often not believed.
64	Google does not block results for "Authorities on subjects" if someone wants an article from the New Scientist. This implies that the company is not an ultimate truth-selling authority and does not challenge existing authorities, such as The Economist on economics. Furthermore, this is how the largely capitalist world works, with monopolies and diopolies existing, leading to startups needing funds and investments, which can lead to profit or loss. Those who can stave off risk and make smart choices can potentially profit, while others will inevitably lose out. Google is simply protecting its assets and turf, just as every other existing company in the world.
65	Google has won the newspaper battle as authors of the articles pay for result slots. Companies can choose to either pay for the slots or be in a desired position, depending on their budget and needs. Moreover, established authorities have the resources and power to protect copyright and patents.
66	Google glass is a new technology that has changed the way we do things. It has enabled people to cheat on tests, however, educators must adapt to these changes and find new methods of teaching. While testing may be ineffective as a learning tool, it can help teachers adjust their approach. If children were able to use Google glass in a productive way, perhaps more learning could take place in public schools.
67	The Google Review System is bad because it cannot guarantee safety and 100% success is only achievable if the review system is purposefully circumvented.
68	Google+ should stay integrated with YouTube because it has the potential to increase viewers and subscribers, and the comment system is not "bad". Additionally, there have been no credible reports of "comment spamming" or "infinite characters" causing problems. Lastly, forcing a Google+ account is not a big issue, and the limited number of issues raised have not been substantiated.
69	To go vegan and stop the murder of these animals would not only counter the effects of our evolution, but would also destroy the industries involved in the selling of these foods, which might mess up the economy. Plus, steak and bacon are amazing. I agree! But we should eat those thing from vegan based ingredients so we don't harm ourselves, non-human animals, or make people over-seas become even more impoverished.

Francione, Gary and Garner, Robert. The Animal Rights Debate: Abolition Or Regulation? Columbia University Press, 2010 (hereafter Francione and Garner 2010), p. 62: "Although veganism may represent a matter of diet or lifestyle for some, ethical veganism is a profound moral and political commitment to abolition on the individual level and extends not only to matters of food but also to the wearing or using of animal products. Ethical veganism is the personal rejection of the commodity status of nonhuman animals ..." "Veganism", Vegetarian Times, January 1989: "Webster's dictionary provides a most dry and limiting definition of the word 'vegan': 'one that consumes no animal food or dairy products.' This description explains dietary veganism, but so-called ethical vegans " and they are the majority " carry the philosophy further.
70	Veganism is the practice of abstaining from animal products and objects, particularly in diet, as well as following an associated philosophy that rejects the commodity status of sentient animals. The vegan ethos is motivated by the recognition that neither man nor beast may be made an object to be sucked dry by the ruling classes. Swallowing semen is consensual act- the sperm is willingly expelled from the body with joy and vigor. Oral sex and the eager lapping that follows is not only wholly within the ethical bounds of veganism, it solves the inequalities vegans object to. In his semenal work, Marx noted: “In proportion as the exploitation of one individual by another is put an end to, the exploitation of one nation by another will also be put an end to. In proportion as the antagonism between classes within the nation vanishes, the hostility of one nation to another will come to an end.” Swallowing is an act which bridges the divide between classes. It removes antagonism as the donor appreciates the moral fortitude of the vegan for finishing the job through to the end.
71	Honestly, you could be vegan I don't care if that's your own free will. If I was trying to force, the resolution would be veganism should be forced upon 99% of adult humans. Instead the resolution is at least 99% of human adults should eat vegan in the entire world. I. Health It is well known that fruits and vegetables are healthy. Vegan diets exclude many foods yet allow fruits and vegetables. Therefore, its only logical that most vegans will eat more fruits and vegetables thus being healthier. A multivitamin can take care of any nutrient deficiencies met on a vegan diet. II. Environment Claim: Meat is wasteful compared to grain. Warrant: "Meat is less efficient because we eat the animal that eats the grain instead of eating the grain ourselves. It takes about 15 pounds of feed to make 1 pound of beef, 6 pounds of feed for 1 pound of pork and 5 pounds of feed for 1 pound of chicken, the Department of Agriculture estimates. For catfish, it's about 2 pounds of feed per pound of fish." [2]. Impact: A vegan diet takes less acreage compared to an omnivorous diet. Helping save the environment. III. Animal happiness Animals are sentient and capable of feeling emotions like happiness and unhappiness. Factory farming is infamous for being cruel. Since the profit motive is at work it will always be cheaper to raise an animal in inhumane conditions like battery cages. "In the wake of an ABC News investigation into alleged unsanitary and inhumane practices at one of the nation's largest egg farms, animal rights activists are calling for an end to the egg industry's widespread use of so-called "battery cages," in which birds live six to a cage in long stacks of wire cages. "[3]. Being confined to battery cages cause unhappiness to animals. IV. World Hunger In part II Environment acreage was mentioned. The grain lots feeding farm animals could be re-purposed to feed hungry humans. [2]. Claim: World hunger exists today Warrant: "The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that about 805 million people of the 7.3 billion people in the world, or one in nine, were suffering from chronic undernourishment in 2012-2014." [3]. Impact: World hunger could be mitigated if more people decided to turn vegan. At least 99% of human adults should eat vegan in the entire world. V.

72	Vegans argue that bacon and steak do not taste the same without their associated meat, and that getting rid of the meat industry entirely would have drastic implications for animals, such as pigs, as well as the human race. They contend that forcing humans to stop eating something that is a part of our diet since the beginning of the human race goes against the laws of nature. In contrast, others argue that transitioning from milk to soy is a viable alternative to the meat industry. Though facon may taste better than bacon, it still does not taste the same. Therefore, the debate between vegans and non-vegans still remains.
73	Hippopotamuses are vegans who falsely claim to be Lacto ovo vegetarians to appear ethical, while whales, porpoises and pigs are unethical meat-eating carnivores.
74	Meat eaters are not ignorant in my opinion. I am sure there are many biologists, gastroenterologists, vets, and pro-animal rights people who eat meat, me falling under the last one. Being at least one of the things on the preceding list should disqualify ignorance as a reason for eating meat. Personally, I enjoy meat because of preference. I understand what happens on farms, factories, butcher shops, restaurants, etc with meat. More selfish? Well, what's selfish? Selfish seems to mean that one cares for one's self without any regards to others. I will agree that selfish is a proper word to use. Meat eaters take advantage of life on earth for personal gain and pleasure. However, we as humans are way past selfish all together. Anyone taking part in the industrial revolution and the results of it are selfish. We take advantage of earth and the things of it for our own personal gain or pleasure. We chop down trees, we dirty up water, we burn oil and coal, we capture animals and genetically change them to be our fluffy pets instead of letting them roam free in the environment, we run over squirrels, and instead of eating food that grows from our surroundings, we destroy land that is already there, plant new plants that aren't natural to the area, and then they take the crops and turn them in to something more desired. Simply put, humans are selfish. We all do things that destroy the environment for our personal gain with little regards for the environment. So, we as humans are selfish and care less about others for our own personal reasons. If this debate is how vegans are better and smarter than meat eaters, than this debate is not a good idea. You and I (I'm assuming you're a vegan) are only different because of our eating choices. We are both, at the end of the day are selfish, less caring beings because we are humans. You have been destructive to the environment for pleasure and personal gain, just as I have. So, I am a more selfish, less caring person than you are because I have different eating choices? I don't think that is a fair, honest analysis of a fellow human being.
75	Humans are selfish and are eating animals' expense, however, enjoying it boosts our morale and mental health. Mental health is an important part of overall health and it is wrong to seek pleasure in the form of murder. Meat is justifiable and has been domesticated over time. It is hard to revert back to how it was before and it will take years. This will cause a lot of economic damage to the first world and some lesser economies. Our actions will cause humans to be on their way out before we can reverse the damage.
76	Women today are less prudish when it comes to ingesting their partner's semen. Some women do so for ethical reasons, while others out of pleasure. However, vegan women refuse to do so due to the animal-product hypocrisy.
77	The Communist Manifesto outlines a progressive and equitable vision for society, and Raisor's response to the debate framed this within this context. Following the Glorious Revolution, the dictator will implement the Manifesto's recommendations in full. First, the vegetarian woman's decision to swallow her boyfriend's semen is a commodity exchange, since the lady enjoys the experience as much as he does. However, this does not mean that she pays him for the service, but rather that it has value for her. This means that the gentleman's sauce should be considered a commodity. Additionally, while girls may not pay for sperm, fertility clinics certainly do. Secondly, the Manifesto's “semenal work” is correctly spelled “seminal”, not “semenal”. Finally, the woman's decision to swallow her boyfriend's semen is not a vegan lifestyle choice, since it is only a matter of taste. Thus, they are hypocrites by consuming animal products when they say they are vegan.
78	It's funny that such arguments would come from a person who only feeds their dog vegetables. Not all animals are omnivores, but most are vegans. Vegetables have all the vitamins and minerals that you've mentioned, and maybe a B12 deficiency is an issue, but "durianride" can help with that. Most human beings, regardless of whether they are meat-eaters or not, have a B12 deficiency, which can be found in vegetables and fruits but not in meat and dairy. Vegetables and fruits are also rich in nutrients that cannot be found in meat, such as chicken and beef. Cheese is another example of an essential nutrient that cannot be found in meat or dairy, and is essential for a healthy life. Without vegetables and fruits, how can one live a healthy life?
79	I'm in favor of nuclear energy as it has many economic benefits and can help us solve the world's biggest problem, climate change. Nuclear power plants may be expensive to build, but they can generate more energy than other sources. When compared to thermal power plants, nuclear energy is a more effective and efficient source of energy. Additionally, the world is running out of fossil fuels and must rely on other sources of energy, such as nuclear energy. This means that we can still use energy but in a much more environmentally friendly way. Nuclear energy also produces much less waste than other forms of energy, with 95% of its energy being utilized without releasing any carbon dioxide. Furthermore, nuclear radiation has its risks, but these risks can be avoided if the necessary precautions are taken, just like with other technological devices we use in our daily lives.
80	The enemy of my enemy is not always my friend, which is true for both my opponent and myself when it comes to nuclear energy. Non-renewable resources are quick to dismiss the positives and exaggerate the negatives of modified capitalosm. Voting issues: 1. Nuclear energy works. 2. It comes with inherent dangers that have yet to be resolved. 3. The start-up costs are prohibitive for much of the world. 4. As a result, nuclear energy makes up only 16%. This is largely due to the fact that alternative sources are more affordable and cleaner. I have demonstrated that renewable energies, including wind, hydro, and solar, are more efficient and come at a lower cost than nuclear. 5. Magnetic energy, while still in its infancy, has the potential to be a viable alternative to nuclear energy. Everyone stands to benefit from this discovery.
81	Nuclear energy provides jobs for half a work-life and is a good source of energy, although it has some drawbacks such as nuclear waste and the cost of operation. Nuclear waste can be solved with the advent of the space elevator within 2-4 decades and fusion reactors approaching in the near future, while the cost of operation benefits the economy in the long run.
82	Nuclear energy is an efficient way to create energy, producing far less carbon dioxide emissions than other forms of energy production, such as coal. However, it does come with its own risks, such as the potential for nuclear accidents, the storage of radioactive waste, and the possibility of creating weapons of mass destruction. Despite these risks, the use of nuclear energy has decreased in recent years due to the rising cost of production, and there is no definitive timeline for when we will have an eco-friendly alternative.
83	Nuclear energy comes with many risks and drawbacks, including waste, cost, dependency, and accidents. In the UK alone, 200 million tons of radioactive waste is produced annually, and there are no perfect studies of the long-term effects of deep geological storage. The Chernobyl disaster is the single worst nuclear accident in history, and its effects are still being felt today. Additionally, nuclear energy is expensive, with a cost increase of 5-7 billion dollars between 2002 and 2009. Solar energy is more reasonably priced and easier to access. Therefore, we should avoid expanding nuclear energy until its drawbacks are overcome.
84	I will first defend my arguments and then attack what my opponent has said. 1) My opponent never really attacks my first contention about how this has worked in other countries so that still stands. 2) My opponent cites hurricane sandy and natural disasters saying that plants could be breached but the American power plants were not damaged. He also makes note of the disaster in Japan. This was not because of a problem with Nuclear reactors but a problem in withholding high standards. These standards are getting met by the U.S.A. and no nuclear damage from sandy is proof. 3) If several stations are commissioned at once, then the cost should go down because of economies of scale - a sort of bulk discount. Once built, nuclear power plants have advantages. In a gas-fired plant, the gas alone makes up 80% of the cost of electricity. So firms and consumers are very exposed to the wholesale price of gas.But at a nuclear power plant, the fuel is processed uranium, accounting for just 10% of the cost of production. While it may cost more to build it will be a good investment for the future.  My opponent says that the exuberant cost is a huge deal. This shows that nuclear power is able to be built for much less than what he has stated. This also shows that once it is built it is far more effective. He states that there is a very large safety issue with nuclear energy. Sorry for the long chart, but this shows that coal is far more dangerous, both in terms of deaths and cost.  Coal " global average 170,000 (50% global electricity)  Coal " China 280,000 (75% China"s electricity)  Coal " U.S. 15,000 (44% U.S. electricity)  Oil 36,000 (36% of energy, 8% of electricity)  Natural Gas 4,000 (20% global electricity)  Biofuel/Biomass 24,000 (21% global energy)  Solar (rooftop) 440 (< 1% global electricity)  Wind 150 (~ 1% global electricity)  Hydro " global average 1,400 (15% global electricity)  Nuclear " global average 90 (17% global electricity w/Chernobyl and Fukushima)  As shown by this chart nuclear energy s by far the most efficient in energy per deaths. If it has the most energy per life lost it is the safest. I also use this rebuttal vs the waste management as it is causing next to no damage. My opponent never says anything that could take over the role of nuclear besides more gas and when we already have to import almost half of our oil this is not the right step.
85	Nuclear energy has both pros and cons, but the pros outweigh the cons. Other countries have been able to successfully manage nuclear energy and its related risks, and it is cost-effective. The Chernobyl disaster is an example of a past nuclear catastrophe, but other countries have been able to develop effective safety protocols since then.
86	In this round, my opponent misinterpreted and misunderstood my arguments, claiming that solar technology is unproven despite its long-term use and recent developments, misrepresenting the time needed to set up alternative forms of energy as opposed to nuclear power, and incorrectly stating that nuclear waste is safely stored away from water sources. Con thusly refutes every point made by my opponent, proving that the United States should not substantially increase its use of nuclear energy.
87	Nuclear energy produces a significant portion of the world's electricity and is a viable option for reducing emissions. While it may produce less carbon emissions than other sources of energy, the risks associated with nuclear energy are not worth the potential benefits. Nuclear energy comes with the risks of catastrophic accidents, hazardous waste, and the potential for weapons production. Additionally, the cost of nuclear power is often overestimated and unreliable due to its unpredictability. The issue of nuclear waste is also significant and needs to be addressed in order for nuclear energy to become a viable option. In conclusion, while nuclear energy may reduce emissions, the associated risks present too great a danger and unreliability to make it a viable and reliable form of energy.
88	Sorry, I've been cruising around in the Caribbean for the past week. I thought I'd have internet, but I didn't. So this'll just have to become a 2-round debate. You're definitely right that coal and oil aren't going to serve us much longer. We're fast reaching the end of the earth's supply of oil. Soon we're going to have to find a different, renewable source of energy to keep us alive and driving our cars. But I don't think the predominant one will be wind energy. Ever notice that the only places that really utilize wind for electricity are small, rural villages? The reason is simple: wind energy just isn't powerful enough to be the primary source of energy for a metropolis like New York.   However, I think nuclear is the way to go. Nuclear reactions create a HUGE amount of power, and if we ever figure out how to make a sustained fusion reaction, we'll have an endless supply of very powerful fuel. Nuclear is much safer today than it was back in the 70s, thanks to improved regulations and engineering. Wind energy is the best available energy because it will never run out. Neither will solar, hydro, geothermal, etc. All other energy's will either run out or are way to expensive to start up and keep running. Not really. It might not be too expensive to make a few hundred windmills for a rural village, but the costs of building and maintaining enough windmills to sustain the whole world (we're talking millions and millions) would be a lot. On the other hand, for example, it is very cheap to put a power plant in a dam or waterfall capable of powering a small city.   Some other energy's are bad for the environment and will make the world a worse place than it is and will be with using fossil fuels. I'm assuming you're referring chiefly to nuclear, which has seen a few unfortunate disasters. But nuclear energy is only dangerous when power plants are poorly maintained or some nutjob throws radioactive isotopes into the ocean. Today's federal regulations make another disaster like Three Mile Island extremely unlikely.   Also, some people are too busy with work and handling kids that they don't have time to try to make a difference in the world and change what energy sources we are using most frequently. Not me. I'm soon going into mechanical engineering, and am strongly considering heading into the field of alternate energy for a career. It really is a promising field.
89	Donald Trump has been popular amongst conservative and independent voters, due to his rhetoric and stances on various topics. However, there have been suggestions that he may not be as conservative as he claims to be. Some have suggested that he is a "Spoiler" taking votes away from other more conservative candidates and ruining the Republicans chances of winning the White House. Despite this, he has still gained a lot of support from these voters. His supporters argue that he is a businessman who knows how to get things done, while his detractors point out that his words may not be backed up by his past actions. Only time will tell if Trump is genuine in his statements and if he is able to bring about the changes he promises.
90	Donald Trump is a successful businessman, but he has some unstable qualities that could lead to disastrous outcomes if he loses his touch. As a candidate for President of the United States, he has suggested unwise policies such as bombing Iraq and Syria without provocation, which could lead to a world war and end very badly. Additionally, Trump has suggested denying refugees from seeking better lives in the US, which goes against our values as a nation. It is clear that Trump is not fit to lead, and we should do our best to ensure he doesn't become president.
91	Donald Trump would be a bad candidate due to his lack of political experience, as well as his racism and sexism. Trump has been recorded making offensive comments about Mexicans and women, and his stance on trade with China is too risky given the US's major trade partnership with them. Trump's insulting comments about women and his sexism tracker shows he is not fit to be president. Additionally, his comments about taxing China and making Mexico pay for a wall show he lacks understanding of global politics. He has no plan to back up his claims, and his inflammatory rhetoric could lead to dangerous situations. Trump is not fit to be the leader of the US, and his inexperience, racism and sexism make him a bad candidate.
92	Donald Trump would be an inexperienced and bad candidate for president, as he has no political experience, is racist and sexist, and doesn't explain his policies in detail. He has made numerous derogatory comments about women, including comparing them to architecture, and about Mexican immigrants, such as referring to them as "rapists". In addition, he has threatened to impose high tariffs on Chinese imports, which could harm US-China relations. Trump's policies also lack specificity and he has failed to explain how he would implement them. All in all, he is an unsuitable candidate for president, and would be worse for the US than any other president in history.
93	Donald Trump is attempting to take over the US government and achieve great power by utilizing Sith-like tactics. He has taken jabs at weaker candidates, and is attempting to tear down his opposition. He also holds xenophobic views and wears Sith garb, showing his connection to the Dark Side.
94	Donald Trump is a racist liar who teases Native Americans and thinks white supremacists are heroes. Voting for him is a terrible idea, and we must stand against him in order to preserve the "land of the free and the home of the brave".
95	qwzx has accepted this debate with knowledge that this results in automatic loss, as dictated by rule 6. However, he's trying to argue his case that I was not specific enough on what exactly you will lose. Any person with common sense would be able to know that I meant he would lose the debate by accepting. However, I ALSO did not specify that I was talking about Donald Jackleberry Trump, an imaginary character made up by me who has very close similarities to Donald J. Trump, but is nonetheless NOT Donald Trump. I did not specify which Trump I meant, so my mistake. The only reason I didn't put in his middle name is because that was already specified in the rules, so my argument stands. Donald Jackleberry Trump is not my president because he is an imaginary characters.
96	Despite being a successful businessman, Donald Trump lacks the necessary humanity and empathy required to be an effective president of the United States. He has already caused controversy by initiating protests, such as the Women's March, and has failed to represent the country in a respectful and unifying manner. As the leader of the largest economy in the world, the president must act as a role model and promote equality, fairness, and kindness. Although he might be a successful businessman, Donald Trump is not the right person to lead the United States.
97	Donald Trump is a liar who has difficulty telling the truth. His statements are often rated "mostly false" or "false" by Politifact, a fact-checking website. Hillary Clinton's statements, on the other hand, are rated less often and to a lower degree.
98	Donald Trump is the only president who is speaking the truth and attempting to make changes, yet no one is listening. If he does not win the election, the Democrats will have no work to do and will continue to find fault while not helping people. Robert de Niro's comments against Trump demonstrate his own hypocrisy, as Trump is trying to make a difference while the Democrats are only interested in creating further chaos.
