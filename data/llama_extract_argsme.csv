0	Climate change does not exist according to sources provided by the opponent. Reasons include that exhaling Carbon Dioxide is not a clear threat to our climate, that it is a conspiracy, and that there are no sources to back up the statement. Sources used to dispute the existence of climate change include a website listing the "top 10 reasons why climate change does not exist", an article from newsmax.com, and an encyclopedia article about the "global warming" hoax.
1	Extracted Gist: Man-made climate change is extremely likely to exist and has claimed human lives, with a scientific consensus among climate scientists existing on the topic. Multiple studies have found that 90-100% of publishing climate scientists agree that humans are the primary cause of recent global warming.
2	1. Climate change is a proven fact, with 97% of scientists believing that it is primarily human-caused.  2. Arguments by climate change deniers are not fact-driven and are likely to be unsuccessful.
3	Climate change presents a serious risk to the future of the Earth and to mankind, with threats ranging from the spread of diseases to increased global conflict. Deniers of climate change should be restricted in their speech due to the severe harms caused by climate change, which is caused by human activity. Jailing people for lying about climate change may be necessary if free speech is to be restricted.
4	Climate change is a real and ongoing threat, and anthropogenic climate change is primarily caused by human activities. Those activities have been thoroughly documented and verified by many scientists around the world. Denying the existence of this climate change is akin to denying the existence of a “Fraud”, with the burden of proof lying on those who question it.
5	The climate is not changing. The local weather may change but the global climate stays basically the same. The oceans are not rising either. The IPCC is a communist organization that has communist agendas.  You can't and shouldn't trust any person or scientist who tells you that the climate is changing. This person will most likely have a secret agenda that has nothing to do with climate. I propose that climate change is a fraud and that the people who support it are all frauds and charlatans. The science of human-caused climate change is faulty and full of misconceptions and bad science.
6	Climate change is an urgent global issue that cannot be ignored. The Earth's temperature has risen by 1"C since 1969 and is expected to continue rising, leading to catastrophic consequences. Arctic sea ice is shrinking and polar bears may see the first iceless summer by 2050. In addition, increasing levels of atmospheric CO2 produced by human industrial activity can be correlated with global temperature rise. These facts and more show that climate change is very real and must be addressed.
7	Climate change is a fraud and those who support it are all frauds and charlatans according to the argument. Evidence suggests that the science of human-caused climate change is faulty and full of misconceptions and bad science. Video evidence, the In-depth Story Behind A Climate Fraud; 97% consensus fraud; proof that climate change is all fake news started by Obama & crew; mathematically impossible and against the laws of physics that a tiny human mass verses huge Earth mass; The properties of CO2 are such that it can't create global warming on the scale indicated by scientists; Maurice Strong is the main person that started this whole climate frenzy movement and was found to be corrupt; Climate data fraud; Tree rings used as evidence when it is known that tree ring growth is not an accurate measurement of temperature; "Hide the decline" email by Phil Jones; Mike's trick; Hockey stick nonsense; Inverted graphs; etc. - All of this evidence suggests that climate change is a fraud.
8	Climate change is caused by human activity, with natural sources accounting for 800 gigatons of CO2 emitted into the atmosphere annually and manmade sources accounting for 29 gigatons. Of the manmade sources, 3.62% is attributed to human activity, which is significantly less than the 400 parts per million (PPM) “threshold” used by alarmists to suggest that CO2 is the cause of global warming. Furthermore, natural sources of CO2 emit far more than manmade sources, making it impossible for the small amount of manmade emissions to be the primary cause of global warming. The alarmists’ argument that 0.04% of atmospheric gases drives global climate is also weakened by the fact that exhaled CO2 is also a small amount, yet it is a natural process that is undeniably part of the global climate cycle. The true reasons for climate change being anthropogenic are financial and political. The federal government has invested over $10 billion in grants for climate change related projects, creating an incentive for scientists to stay in agreement with the political powers that be. Additionally, the solutions proposed to this false issue involve more governmental control and are perfect for oppressive progressive politicians who want to expand their power. By creating a false crisis, the politicians are able to gain compliance from scientists and citizens alike. It is clear that anthropogenic climate change is a political, not a scientific, issue.
9	Climate change is a political debate that deniers try to make look like a scientific debate, yet 97% of scientists agree on the consensus that it is occurring. Additionally, the burning of fossil fuels and the released CO2 is the main driver of climate change.
10	Feminism is a movement that strives to challenge gender inequality and promote the rights of women. There are many different types of feminism, and the Pink Hat movement is not the only one. Antiporn and Cultural Feminism seek to do away with the dehumanization of women in pornography, while Radical feminism aims to abolish the gender binary altogether. Feminism has gone too far, according to this debater, when it conflicts with other social values and ideologies.
11	Feminism is a movement that advocates for the rights and liberation of women, as well as standing up against any form of woman abuse. It is not limited to women, men can also be feminists and advocate for gender equality.
12	Pro has provided multiple sources to demonstrate that Feminism is the movement for equality between men and women, while Con has only offered one argument without any evidence to support the claim that words with similar roots cannot have different meanings. Con's argument is not sound, and Pro is therefore proven to be the winner of this debate.
13	Feminism is the doctrine advocating social, political, and all other rights of women equal to those of men. Now, you admit that this is something you are for, so I guess you have problems with how feminists go about this? Really, I think your entire argument stems from a complete misunderstanding of the movement. So, what is feminism? This is a difficult question because, much like religion, feminism is different for each feminist. The mission statement of the movement is equal rights between the sexes, which you agree is good. By this definition, you are a feminist. If you could indicate how you aren't a feminist, that'd be appreciated. Maybe you disagree that there is a systematic discrimination against women, the patriarchy. Is there a patriarchy? Well, as it commonly seems to be the case, I must define "the patriarchy". Basically, it means a system where men are valued over women[2]. This can be shown in the wage gap[3], rape culture[4] (though men can be victims of rape, rape culture usually targets women), and gender roles[5].
14	Feminism is an important movement that focuses on achieving equality between the sexes, especially in first-world countries where it has already been largely successful. However, feminism will still be necessary in some third-world countries to help maintain equality and spread the ideology to help others. Despite con's opinion, feminism is still necessary in order to continue pushing for progress and achieve true equality.
15	Feminism is needed in some countries where women are oppressed and have few rights, but conditions in these countries must be taken into consideration, such as their economy and social interaction. Slow, progressive changes must be made before feminism can be implemented, such as addressing each conflict differently, in order to prevent massive revolts that could massacre women. Before feminism is introduced, democracy and peace must reach these countries, as Islamic laws make women cover themselves and listen to their husbands, which is misinterpreted as complete control. A powerful religious event, talking about the true vision of Allah, could influence Islamic country leaders to establish laws that establish at least democratic rights or feminism in the country.
16	Feminism was originally founded on the belief that men and women should be equal, but third wave feminism has made it clear that this is no longer the case. While modern feminism may have started as a way to right the wrongs of the past, it has become increasingly harmful to the relationship between the sexes.
17	Feminism is an ideology which aims to advocate for the rights and equality of women, however not all men identify with it due to gender identities and beliefs. Egalitarianism is a philosophy which seeks to promote the idea that all people should be treated equally regardless of gender, race, or any other social divisions. Despite this, the two are often used interchangeably. Feminism works to achieve equality for women while still excluding other genders, whereas Egalitarianism works to achieve equality for all people.
18	Pro conceded that feminism is good by admitting that they are pro equal rights, thus by the definition of feminism, pro is pro feminism. Additionally, pro did not attack Observation 2 or Advantages 1 and 2, thus concluding that pro does not deny that feminism is bad.
19	Feminism today is twisted and hypocritical, and the definition of feminis is biased towards females. Therefore, it is best to abandon it and strive for equality for both men and women.
20	Mother Teresa argued that abortion is one of the greatest destroyers of peace because if a mother can kill her own child, then there is nothing to stop two people from killing each other. About 42 million women in the world choose to have an abortion, which is defined as the deliberate termination of a human pregnancy. Abortion is a highly controversial topic, with some people believing it should be illegal and others thinking it should stay legal. Those in favor of abortion argue that it should be safe and legal, while those against argue that it is not safe and should remain illegal. Those in favor of abortion also argue that laws protecting unborn babies should not be changed, while opponents believe that fetuses can feel pain and that abortion should be illegal in all cases.
21	Abortion should be legal because women should have the right to choose what happens to their own bodies. A woman should be able to decide whether or not to continue a pregnancy. Every woman is different, and what might be the right decision for one woman may not be the right decision for another. Abortion should remain safe and legal in order to give women the autonomy they deserve.
22	Abortion is a controversial topic that divides opinions, with some people believing that it should be legal in certain cases, while others argue that it is wrong in all cases. Some people support the use of torture against terrorists while others oppose it, with the majority view being that it should only be used in very exceptional cases. Similarly, many people hold the view that the death penalty should not be used, while others believe that it can be used in certain cases. Ultimately, these decisions depend on each person's beliefs, values and morals.
23	Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy either spontaneously or induced which results in the death of a fetus or embryo. It is commonly performed for therapeutic or elective reasons, and is generally accepted in the context of human pregnancies. However, some people object to abortion on moral or religious grounds, while others support it in certain instances. The answer to the question of whether one believes in torturing terrorists, executing convicted murderers, or performing abortions is dependent on personal beliefs and opinions.
24	Abortion is a controversial topic, with some people believing it should only be performed in certain cases, while others believe it should not be allowed under any circumstances. Those in favour of allowing abortion argue that it should be legal and available in cases where the pregnancy is not wanted, poses a risk to the woman's health or life, or is the result of rape or incest. Those against argue that abortion takes away a foetus' right to life, and is wrong in all circumstances.
25	Abortion is needed to control the population and prevent it from growing excessively. If our country bans abortion, it will be similar to China's approach, which forces women to undergo abortion against their will and causes a high suicide rate among them. Men have a higher suicide rate than women, but if abortion were illegal, the population would grow and force abortion onto women later in life, resulting in an even higher suicide rate among women.
26	The subject of the debate is whether abortion should be accepted or not. The opponent's argument that "whether or not abortion can also be classified as assault is irrelevant to this debate" is incorrect as it is directly related to the acceptance of abortion. If one acknowledges that abortion can also be classified as assault, then it follows that the acceptance of abortion should be rejected. Abortion is only abortion if it is considered to be or not to be by the child carrier. If not considered abortion, it is only a mere act of assault. This can happen to anyone. The opponent's ideology of the "morning after pill" is also another form of abortion which should be rejected. Referring back to the opponent's definition of abortion, the morning after pill is also another form of abortion. It all eliminates the infant correct? Therefore, the opponent's argument that the morning after pill is the solution to pregnancy is flawed. Any act of the mother eliminating her child would be classified as abortion only if it is intended by the carrier. Immorality: Yes, I was intending it to fall under my opponent's four categories.
27	Pro contends that preventing abortion would force women to pay for unwanted children they may have, which would cause mass overpopulation, and that this would result in a form of enslavement. Con, however, argues that if the woman is forced to pay for the abortion, then con would agree that abortion is okay if the woman pays for it. Con's argument applies to pro's side, not their own, since pro is arguing that not allowing abortion would enslave people.
28	Abortion should be made legal, as it does not reduce the amount of abortions, but increases maternal mortality. Additionally, the decision to undergo a pregnancy and take the associated risks should be made by the pregnant person themselves and not by law enforcement or others. Women's lives, health, and basic human rights depend on the availability of abortion, and these factors alone are sufficient to justify its legalization.
29	Arguments for and against abortion should be determined by whether or not the fetus is sentient or not.
30	Trump does not meet the requirements for life, therefore, "trump is life" is false. Life requires the ability to grow, change, and adapt to the environment, as well as metabolism, growth, adaptation, and reproduction. Trump does not possess these abilities, so it cannot be considered alive.
31	Trump's racist rhetoric is dangerous and could lead to the destruction of the US. It incites hatred and mistrust and has been linked to poor physical and mental health, reduced productivity and life expectancy. His supporters should be aware of the consequences of their choices and understand the harm it causes to those on the receiving end of such abhorrent language. His rhetoric is contrary to community building, causes crime, and ultimately destroys trust within communities.
32	Trump's policies revolve around the notion that he will make the greatest president of all time. He plans to do this by building a wall along the US-Mexico border, fighting ISIS, and strengthening the Christian religion. Additionally, he claims that Mexico will pay for the wall and obesity rates in the US will go down due to less authentic Mexican food. His statements on immigration have been met with controversy but he claims to have a plan to put an end to it. Lastly, he promises to bring back the American Dream and make it bigger and better than ever.
33	Trump is an inconsiderate jerk who wants to reduce the national debt by building a wall but will put us further into debt and not address the issue of illegal immigration.
34	Trump's stance on immigration has been called into question due to his past associations with racist organizations and policies. His policies will only fuel more racism, and the death of innocent people. Therefore, voting for Trump would be detrimental to the country. Vote neg.
35	Donald Trump has changed his opinion on a number of issues over the years, from healthcare to politics, yet he is still popular among Republicans. He has donated to and supported Bill and Hillary Clinton in the past, but this does not mean that he is part of an elaborate plot to make Hillary Clinton president. Trump is not extremely religious, but this does not make him any less acceptable to Republicans. In fact, the Bible quotes that the video pulls up are open to interpretation and do not necessarily mean that Trump is not forgiven by God.
36	Donald Trump is the most appropriate leader to tackle Islamic terrorism due to his strong negotiating skills and no-nonsense attitude. He has proven to be successful in business dealings and is not afraid to speak his mind. His policies may not always be politically correct, but his direct approach could be beneficial for the US.
37	I accept. Before we begin I would like to clear some things up for the voters and provide definitions. There is no clear resolution so I will provide one after the definitions.   Trump - a card of a suit any of whose cards will win over a card that is not of this suit   President - (Definition 2) an officer appointed or elected to preside over an organized body of persons   Full Resolution based off of definitions - A Card Trump Should Not Be The President Of The World   My stance is as follows: A Card Trump Should Not Be The President Of The World
38	In round 2, I demolished everyone's source that Trump is a liar: WashPo's list is full of clearly non-lies. Probably nothing on their list is a real lie.   My opponent's Round 2 response was just a rehash of his Round 1 rant.   Says who? Does WashPo have a tracker for Obama's lies, Bush's lies, Clinton's lies? -Nope. We can't know how his lying compares without having comparable lists.   Everyone lies.   This is my exact point: Trump is just another one of the everyone that lie. Why should his lies be tracked when no one else's have been? I assert that Trump doesn't lie in a manner worthy of special tracking. His lack of complete honesty is in line with the mainstream of US politicians and media outlets nowadays.
39	Donald Trump is a serial liar who has difficulty telling the truth and is easily caught in his fabrications. On the other hand, Hillary Clinton is less often found to be false in her claims.
40	Round 2 Conclusion:  I don't know what political correctness has to do with this debate; if you would be so kind as to explain so both of us have some context to argue off of, that would be nice.   Pro argues that Brexit will have mainly negative consequences and Con argues that it will have mainly positive consequences. The burden of proof lies on Con to provide evidence that Brexit will have mainly positive consequences. Without any evidence, Pro has effectively refuted Con's argument. Con concedes that Brexit will have mainly negative consequences, since they have not provided any evidence to the contrary.
41	Brexit would have accomplished nothing in immigration and would hurt the UK economy in the long run. The Leave side’s economics were irrational and unsupported by facts, while the Remain side had the rational arguments and facts on their side.
42	Brexit will be good for England as it will allow them to close their border to the flood of migrants, keep a close eye on illegal immigration from the Middle East, and save them money from EU fees. Switzerland and Norway are countries that are well off and do not need to follow the rules imposed by the EU, and can run their own countries as fit. Borders are made to protect nations, and by not being in the EU, England will be able to close their border to the floods of migration that the rest of Europe is seeing, while still having the freedom to make their own rules. Europe is divided into many countries for a reason, and the EU is just another attempt at forming a superstate that will not work. Brexit will be good for England.
43	England should leave the EU due to the security risks posed by the open borders within the EU. The migrant crisis in Europe is a direct result of these open borders and is a security threat that England should not have to shoulder alone. Furthermore, Switzerland and Norway are successful countries that are not part of the EU, proving that England does not need to be part of the EU to be successful. The 50% of British people that agree with Brexit are right to want England to leave the EU as it is not in their best interests to remain.
44	Britain has always had a strong connection with Europe and has benefited greatly from its membership. Brexit would cause Britain to be excluded from important decisions in Europe and weaken its global influence. This would be a major blow to British interests.
45	My opponent claims that the use of sources is important but that when using sources, you must include quotation marks and properly reference your source. If you don't, you're guilty of plagiarism. However, my opponent has not provided any evidence to back up this claim, and has instead fallen into the logical fallacy of a "bare assertion" fallacy. This means that his claim cannot be trusted, and I urge the voters to reject his argument.
46	Brexit has had a negative effect on the people of England due to migration and rising unemployment. This has resulted in difficulty in finding employment, as well as issues with education, health, and daily living. However, establishing new industries could provide employment opportunities and enployment in other trading countries.
47	The Government argues that Brexit could result in increased costs for Britain when trading with other countries, and that it could take up to two years to negotiate new laws and trade agreements. They claim that Britain has been in the EU for too long and that a trial period is needed to find a new way of doing things. The Opposition argues that terrorist ideas are home-grown, not imported, and that an emphasis should be on the education system. The Government disagrees, claiming that most terrorists have radical Islamic views due to their Islamic descent. They also argue that there is a need to have more control over Britain's borders due to influx of migrants from Muslim countries, and fears that Turkey trying to push its way to visa-free travel could impact the community.
48	The UK is making a historical decision to leave the European Union, and the proponent believes it will be beneficial in the long run as an independent nation. The opponent refused to look at the EU constitution, but the proponent provided evidence from reliable sources, including the EU constitution, to support their argument. The proponent believes that Brexit will bring a more free, independent, and self-sufficient UK. Despite not being able to convince the opponent to look at the evidence, the proponent is confident that their argument will be proven right in the end.
49	The death penalty is expensive, unpredictable and does not deter crime. It also puts innocent lives at risk and does not help reduce crime rates. Spending the rest of one's life in prison is a much worse punishment than death, and the state should be mindful of its responsibility in taking a life. Ultimately, the decision to institute the death penalty should be left to individual states, as the implications of such a policy should be carefully considered.
50	In the United States, there is a controversy surrounding the death penalty. Some people argue that it is not effective at reducing crime, while others believe that it serves as a deterrent to potential criminals. The death penalty also carries a risk of wrongful executions, as demonstrated in the cases of Dudley Sharp and Justice For All. Additionally, research shows that death penalty cases are more expensive than life imprisonment without parole.
51	Rebuttal 1: The cost of a death penalty case can be less than a life without parole case due to the shorter trial process and lower appeal costs. Furthermore, some states have an "at-cost" policy for the death penalty, meaning the state is charged the same fee for a death penalty case as for a life without parole case.   Rebuttal 2: The death penalty has been upheld in several different states, from large states such as Texas and Georgia to smaller states such as Delaware and Hawaii. It is also used by the federal government and is active in 32 of the 50 United States. Furthermore, some countries in Europe and Asia such as Japan have also implemented the death penalty.   Rebuttal 3: The U.S. justice system has failed on rare occasions, but this does not mean the death penalty is necessarily flawed. The same can be said of any system in the world. Additionally, DNA testing is not always accurate and a false conviction can still occur with a life without parole sentence.  Rebuttal 4: Murder has always been considered an atrocious crime, regardless of the time period in which it was committed.  Rebuttal 5: This is speculation. Criminals may be deterred by the death penalty because they know the consequences of their actions are far more serious than they would be with a life without parole sentence. Additionally, criminals may seek the death penalty in order to receive a shorter trial process, which could allow them to spend less time in prison.
52	The death penalty exists to deter crime, to avenge the innocent, and to put fear into criminals and others who may consider breaking the law. Without the death penalty, crime rate would increase due to overcrowding in jails, criminals being set free, and a lack of fear amongst citizens. On the other hand, opponents of the death penalty argue that it is inhumane, can lead to wrongful executions, and does not have a deterrent effect on crime.
53	The death penalty is a good idea because it decreases the prisoner population, reduces the risk of criminals killing again, and is a good deterrent.
54	The death penalty is often perceived as a misuse of taxpayer dollars, but in some cases it can be less expensive than keeping a criminal in prison for life. Additionally, the death penalty is not always completely painless and innocent people have been wrongly executed in the last 20 years. Furthermore, the death penalty is applied unequally and it is a source of intimidation. It is also becoming increasingly used in a light manner, and criminals are aware that they will not face the harshest of punishments. As a result, the justice system is becoming more relaxed and criminals are not being deterred as much as they should be.
55	The death penalty is immoral because it gives the government the power to take an innocent person's life, and it is possible for someone to be wrongly convicted and sentenced to death. Additionally, the death penalty implies that a jury of 12 people is qualified to take life, which could lead to mob executions.
56	The death penalty is more expensive than keeping a person in prison for life, as it requires more resources and appeals to carry out the sentence. Furthermore, innocent people have been known to be executed in the past, which is a major issue with the death penalty. Additionally, life imprisonment prevents the perpetrator from committing other crimes and gives them access to mental health services, making it a more humane punishment.
57	The majority of people in the United States support the death penalty, so it is seen as a way to create justice and put the public's mind at ease. In the United Kingdom, prisons are more humane and do not rely on the degrading methods used in Arizona, so the death penalty is not seen as necessary.
58	1. Life imprisonment focuses on rehabilitation and forgiveness, while the death penalty focuses on vengeance and punishment, therefore life imprisonment is a more humane form of punishment. 2. The death penalty is expensive and prone to mistakes, while life imprisonment is cheaper and less prone to mistakes. 3. The death penalty is not an effective deterrent, while life imprisonment may be an effective deterrent depending on the situation.  4. Excessive use of the death penalty creates fear in society, while a more moderate use of life imprisonment and morality injections can provide better guidance to society. 5. The video supports the idea that the death penalty is not an effective form of punishment, as it is not a deterrent and can lead to the execution of innocent people.
59	Google is taking away our freedom by releasing products like Google Classroom and self-driving cars, which could potentially put every document on the internet and make paper obsolete. By controlling education and access to food and shopping, Google can control how people think. A man said (name withheld), “if Google buys Walmart, they can take over the world.” This is a dangerous situation, as Google is slowly taking away our freedom and changing the way we think.
60	Google has the advantage of being better known and having been around longer than Bing, which is beginning to gain more traction. While 33% of Google users said they would switch to Bing, 67% of people would not. This suggests that there is still room for growth for Bing, since many people are still unwilling to switch. In addition, the website Con provided does not necessarily represent the opinions of all people, so it is not clear that 67% of people will not use Bing instead of Google. Overall, the evidence suggests that while Google is popular and has the advantage of being established, Bing is catching up and has the potential to be a competitive alternative.
61	1. Google is a reliable source 2. Google is true so "pro must win" 3. Con: google said unreliable 4. Con search prove "google not reilable" 5. "reilable" not "reliable" 6. "Con is wrong" 7. "This is an argument" 8. "Con has no evidence" 9. "Disregard their argument" 10. Con is illuminati 11. "You can't trust con"
62	My opponent has failed to refute any point that I have made, which indicates that he is conceding this debate. Additionally, he mentions "things such as this" which suggests that Google is not the best search engine because of its safety flaws.
63	Microsoft has been running ads comparing Bing and Google, claiming that in a "blind comparison test" users preferred Bing 2:1. Despite these claims, many people express skepticism, as those who prefer Google are often biased parties that have never used Bing or don't use it regularly.
64	Google doesn't block results for "Authorities on subjects" and is merely protecting its assets/turf, just like every other existing company in the world.
65	Google has won the battle between newspapers and search engines, as it is the most used resource for finding news articles. As a result, newspapers are now focused on defining what "It's business" is, and whether or not paying Google for result slots constitutes as a form of "pay-to-play".
66	Google glass is a new technology that can be used to cheat on tests, but it is the responsibility of educators to find new methods of learning. There is still a level of learning that needs to take place in order to use google glass on a test, but testing may be an ineffective tool for learning. Perhaps public schools could help students learn more effectively if they were allowed to use google glass in a productive way.
67	Cities are designed to have all the available resources within reach for the populace to survive. These "Cities" have a common understanding of the way things need to work in order to "function". "Cities" have plenty of "safety" regulations that are governed by "law" which is enforced to "function". Even then of the countless number of ways that we have tried to guarantee safety through history--we have never been able to. "Crime" does exist within the populace and it is the only 100% certainty I see. So my objection to this statement would be, Logic cannot guarantee safety, Because there will always be an object that will purposefully circumvent commands that are expect a specific result to function. This I state as 100% guaranteed. If this is so, And bad and good are the measurement of success and the achievement of 100% is the criteria, Then I would say; The Google Review System is Bad. I would like to end this round with my single objection.
68	Google+ integration with YouTube has had numerous beneficial effects such as increased comment quality, better comment system, and more viewers and subscribers. The only argument against it is that it might decrease viewership and subscribers, which has not been proven, and some people are resistant to change. There is also the issue of "Bob's Army" spam, which is not inherently the fault of Google, but rather people's resistance to the integration. However, this has not been an issue in recent months, and is not a serious enough issue to warrant removal of the integration. Finally, forcing people to have a Google+ account is not a valid concern, as it is a free account with no harm to the user. In conclusion, the benefits of the integration far outweigh any potential issues, and it should stay as it is.
69	To go vegan and stop the murder of these animals would not only counter the effects of our evolution, but would also destroy the industries involved in the selling of these foods, which might mess up the economy. Plus, steak and bacon are amazing. I agree! But we should eat those thing from vegan based ingredients so we don't harm ourselves, non-human animals, or make people over-seas become even more impoverished.

"Alcott, Amos Bronson," in The Oxford Companion to American Literature, Oxford University Press, 1995, p. 14. Also see Francis, Richard. Fruitlands: The Alcott Family and their Search for Utopia, Yale University Press, 2010. Jump up ^ "Vegan Diets Become More Popular, More Mainstream", Associated Press/CBS News, 5 January 2011: "Ethical vegans have a moral aversion to harming animals for human consumption ... though the term often is used to describe people who follow the diet, not the larger philosophy." Francione, Gary and Garner, Robert. The Animal Rights Debate: Abolition Or Regulation? Columbia University Press, 2010 (hereafter Francione and Garner 2010), p. 62: "Although veganism may represent a matter of diet or lifestyle for some, ethical veganism is a profound moral and political commitment to abolition on the individual level and extends not only to matters of food but also to the wearing or using of animal products. Ethical veganism is the personal rejection of the commodity status of nonhuman animals ..." "Veganism", Vegetarian Times, January 1989: "Webster's dictionary provides a most dry and limiting definition of the word 'vegan': 'one that consumes no animal food or dairy products.' This description explains dietary veganism, but so-called ethical vegans " and they are the majority " carry the philosophy further."
70	The vegan ethos is motivated by the recognition that neither man nor beast may be made an object to be sucked dry by the ruling classes. Vegans see ethical worth in all sentient beings and so refuse to partake in the reification of animals. Meat and leather represent the coercive transformation of a sentient being into an object to be sold and consumed. Swallowing semen is consensual act- the sperm is willingly expelled from the body with joy and vigor. Oral sex and the eager lapping that follows is not only wholly within the ethical bounds of veganism, it solves the inequalities vegans object to. In his semenal work, Marx noted: “In proportion as the exploitation of one individual by another is put an end to, the exploitation of one nation by another will also be put an end to. In proportion as the antagonism between classes within the nation vanishes, the hostility of one nation to another will come to an end.” Swallowing is an act which bridges the divide between classes. It removes antagonism as the donor appreciates the moral fortitude of the vegan for finishing the job through to the end.
71	The resolution is whether or not at least 99% of human adults should eat vegan in the entire world. Pro argues that veganism should be forced upon 99% of adult humans. Con argues that a vegan diet takes less acreage compared to an omnivorous diet, and that world hunger could be mitigated if more people decided to turn vegan. In regards to this, Pro’s argument that veganism should be forced upon 99% of adult humans is moot since it does not present evidence or reasons why veganism should be imposed on the majority of adults in the world. Additionally, Con’s argument that a vegan diet takes less acreage compared to an omnivorous diet and that world hunger could be mitigated if more people decided to turn vegan is supported by evidence. Thus, the resolution should be voted in favor of Con.
72	Bacon and steak are not really bacon and steak without the meat that goes into them. Also, in many countries, including America, the majority of the population eat meat. While some might argue that facon tastes better than bacon, it can be agreed that it does not taste the same. Plus, getting rid of the meat industry entirely would be different than transitioning from milk to soy (more milk is sold than soy anyways). With no more meat being sold, animals like pigs would no longer be useful, and many of them might be slaughtered. To cause everyone to go vegan might in a way support the cause you are fighting against. Humans aren't the only ones who kill living beings, many animals like tigers, lions, and sharks eat living beings to survive. We do not force them to eat plants though! Why are humans supposed to defy the laws of nature and stop eating something that has been part of our diet since the beginning of the human race?
73	Hippopotamuses are vegan, as they only eat grass, water plants, and such things, but they pretend to be lacto ovo vegetarians by eating eggs, milk, and cheese. Whales, porpoises, and pigs, however, are non-vegan carnivors, as they eat other animals.
74	Meat eaters are not ignorant in my opinion. I am sure there are many biologists, gastroenterologists, vets, and pro animal rights people who eat meat, me falling under the last one. Being at least one of the things on the preceding list should disqualify ignorance as a reason for eating meat. Personally, I enjoy meat because of preference. I understand what happens on farms, factories, butcher shops, restaurants, etc with meat. More selfish? Well, what's selfish? Selfish seems to mean that one cares for one's self without any regards to others. I will agree that selfish is a proper word to use. Meat eaters take advantage of life on earth for personal gain and pleasure. However, we as humans are way past selfish all together. Anyone taking part in the industrial revolution and the results of it are selfish. We take advantage of earth and the things of it for our own personal gain or pleasure. We chop down trees, we dirty up water, we burn oil and coal, we dig and landscape every other acre of earth, we capture animals and genetically change them to be our fluffy pets instead of letting them roam free in the environment, we run over squirrels, and instead of eating food that grows from our surroundings, we destroy land that is already there, plant new plants that aren't natural to the area, and then they take the crops and turn them in to something more desired. Simply put, humans are selfish. We all do things that destroy the environment for our personal gain with little regards for the environment. So, we as humans are selfish and care less about others for our own personal reasons. If this debate is how vegans are better and smarter than meat eaters, than this debate is not a good idea. You and I (I'm assuming you're a vegan) are only different because of our eating choices. We are both, at the end of the day are selfish, less caring beings because we are humans. You have been destructive to the environment for pleasure and personal gain, just as I have. So, I am a more selfish, less caring person than you are because I have different eating choices? I don't think that is a fair, honest analysis of a fellow human being.
75	Arguments about veganism being the solution to animal welfare and exploitation rely on the premise that animal welfare and exploitation are important enough to warrant drastic measures. The opponent suggests that animal testing, habitat destruction, and other activities that involve animal exploitation should also be addressed, but these activities are not as heavily regulated or scrutinized as the animal agriculture industry and thus are not priorities for animal rights activists. The opponent contends that veganism should not be the sole focus of animal welfare activism because other issues are equally, if not more, important.
76	Women today are more accepting of the practice of ingesting their partner's semen, however, some vegan women are ethically opposed to consuming animal products, including sperm. This is considered hypocritical since humans are a species of animal and sperm is produced by humans.
77	Vegan women who eat their partners' semen are being hypocritical because they are breaking their vow not to consume animal products, even though being vegetarian is a matter of choice rather than necessity in developed countries. Protein-rich animal products are high in nutritional value and the woman receives sustenance from her boyfriend's semen.
78	Most animals are vegans and vegetables are rich in essential nutrients nowhere to be found in meat and dairy. Vegetables and fruits are also rich in nutrients that you can never find in meat, such as chicken and beef, and cheese is an essential nutrient.
79	Nuclear energy has economic and environmental benefits, but also carries risks. Economically, it is expensive to build nuclear power plants, but it will gain us more energy than other sources. Environmentally, nuclear energy produces radioactive waste and can cause cancer if exposed to radiation. Despite this, we must use nuclear energy to stop global warming, as it burns up 95% of its energy without producing any CO2. We should trust in our technology and scientists to make nuclear energy safe and use it to solve our global warming crisis.
80	Nuclear energy is not as popular as alternative sources such as wind, hydro and solar due to the cost of start up and the toxic waste it produces. Magnetic energy is a possible alternative with potential to benefit everyone, but it is still in its infancy and a financial threat to the "Haliburtons of the world". Renewable energies such as wind, hydro and solar are more efficient, affordable and cleaner options with a greater capacity to be used by everyone.
81	Nuclear energy creates jobs that last until half of the worker's retirement age and is a reliable source of energy, but it comes with the downside of nuclear waste. The cost of this energy source is beneficial to the economy, but my opponent has failed to acknowledge that this is a debate about the merits of nuclear power compared to other forms, not whether other forms are better. Fusion reactors and the space elevator are both potential solutions to the nuclear waste problem, which will be available in the near future.
82	Nuclear energy has both positive and negative aspects. On the positive side, it is an efficient source of energy that produces less carbon dioxide emissions compared to other sources such as coal. On the negative side, it is associated with the risk of radiation leaks, the production of radioactive waste and the potential for nuclear accidents. In addition, the cost of nuclear energy is currently high and is likely to increase in the future. Finally, nuclear energy has a long-term environmental impact due to the radioactive waste it produces that needs to be stored safely for thousands of years.
83	In summary, nuclear energy has four main drawbacks – waste, cost, dependency and accidents – and should not be expanded upon due to its high cost, the risk of nuclear accidents, the dependency it creates in developing countries, and the waste it produces. Solar energy is a more reasonable and affordable choice for consumers and the environment.
84	Nuclear energy is efficient and safe. It has been proven to be more effective than other sources of energy with a much lower death rate. Additionally, its economies of scale allow for a decrease in cost when more stations are built at once.
85	Nuclear energy has both benefits and drawbacks, but it's generally considered to be a more sustainable form of energy than other sources. Other countries have been successfully managing nuclear accidents and waste, and the United States doesn't need to use its existing nuclear weapons or develop new ones.
86	My opponent's argument for the need of nuclear energy NOW has been refuted as it is based on misunderstandings and false claims. Most nuclear power plants are located on the East coast, and no such desert to seclude nuclear waste exists. Solar technology has been proven for years and recent developments in solar technology have also been proven several times. As such, the United States should not substantially increase nuclear energy.
87	Nuclear energy is an important part of the energy pie, however, there are several issues that need to be addressed. Carbon emissions need to be reduced to meet the challenge of global warming. Nuclear energy releases dangerous radiation, requires high security for storage, and creates nuclear waste that is difficult to dispose of safely. Additionally, even if nuclear energy increases in output, it is not a feasible solution for the foreseeable future due to these issues. Therefore, it cannot be relied upon as a solution to global energy needs.
88	Wind energy is not the best available energy source because it is limited and not cost-effective enough to be used on a large scale. Nuclear energy, however, is a powerful and relatively inexpensive energy source that has a near-infinite supply of fuel and produces virtually no pollution. It is also safer than other forms of energy production, with modern federal regulations making nuclear disasters rare and easily contained.
89	Donald Trump is a businessman who claims to be conservative, but has been accused of being a "Spoiler" in the Republican primary, taking votes away from more known conservative candidates. He has contributed to both democratic and republican organizations, leading some to question his true beliefs. Trump says he is listening to conservatives and wants to promote their beliefs, but only time will tell if this is the case.
90	Donald Trump is a successful businessman, but he may lose his touch. He has unstable qualities and has declared himself God. He is also against taking in people seeking a better life and has proposed violent solutions to international conflicts. We should not vote for Donald Trump as it will end badly.
91	Donald Trump is an unpopular candidate with no political experience, who is both racist and sexist. His remarks about Mexican immigrants and women are extremely offensive and many of his comments about China have sparked international outcry. He has proposed to replace Obamacare with something "terrific" but has not explained how it would be achieved. He has also threatened to impose tariffs on China, which would be highly damaging to the US economy. Trump's candidacy has been largely unsupported by the Republicans, and he has no political or military experience which would be necessary to lead the US. In addition, his views on women, particularly his demeaning comments about them, makes him an unacceptable candidate for president.
92	Donald Trump is a dangerous, inexperienced candidate who is both racist and sexist. He has no idea how to replace Obamacare, risks damaging trade relations with China, and has no plan to make Mexico pay for his wall. He has insulted women and Mexicans, and his actions suggest that he is unfit to lead.
93	Donald Trump is trying to seize ultimate power by using the Sith's kratocratic tactics of force and cunning. He has been highly critical of the current leadership, and is attempting to tear down weaker candidates to achieve his goal. Furthermore, his racist rhetoric towards Mexicans and criminals is reminiscent of the Sith's hatred towards the Jedi. Trump's garments and army of soldiers indicate his connection to the Dark Side.
94	Donald Trump is racist and a liar who teases Native Americans, thinks white supremacists are heroes and may want to kill the current President of the United States. Voting for him is a terrible idea, so stand against him by supporting Drago 31.
95	qwzx accepted this debate with the understanding that it would lead to automatic loss, as specified by rule 6. He argued that I was not specific enough on the exact loss he would suffer. Any reasonable person would be able to infer from this that he was referring to Donald Trump. However, qwzx did not specify which Donald Trump he was referring to, so he made an understandable mistake. As such, Donald Jackleberry Trump is not qwzx's president as he is an imaginary character.
96	Donald Trump may be a successful businessman, but he lacks the necessary qualities to be an effective President of the United States. He is unable to connect to people and promote equality and kindness, which is essential for the role. Furthermore, he has already caused protests and acted in a manner unbefitting of a President.
97	Donald Trump is a serial liar and has trouble with the truth, with 76% of his statements being rated false or "pants on fire" by Politifact. Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, has a total of 29% false statements.
98	Donald Trump is the only President who is telling the truth and yet nobody is paying attention to him. The Democrats are forever finding fault and not helping people, so if Trump doesn't win the election, the Democrats will have nothing to do.
