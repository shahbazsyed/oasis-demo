0	Climate change clearly does not exist, as evidenced by the fact that exhaling carbon dioxide is no clear threat to our climate, as we do it ourselves and cars also do it; it is a conspiracy; and there are no sources to back the statement up. Global Climate Scam, Newsmax, and Wikipedia all point to the same conclusion: climate change is fake.
1	A scientific consensus exists on the reality of anthropogenic climate change. It is time for the rest of us to listen and take action to reduce our emissions. Man-made climate change has already claimed human lives and continues to do so, with over 150,000 deaths annually attributed to the effects of climate change. The scientific community is in near unanimous agreement that humans are the cause, with 90-100% of climate researchers believing that anthropogenic climate change is occurring.
2	My position on climate change is that I believe in it and think it is largely caused by human activity. I will begin my opening argument by stating that global warming is an established fact and anyone who disagrees is lacking in knowledge on this subject. 97% of scientists agree that climate change is primarily caused by humans. Deniers of human-caused climate change have been refuted by fact-based arguments. I wish my opponent the best of luck. Sources: Shaftel, H. (Ed.). (2012, January 5). Global Climate Change: Consensus. Retrieved February 3, 2015, from http://climate.nasa.gov...
3	There is an overwhelming scientific consensus that climate change presents a serious risk to the future of the Earth and to mankind. Many of the threats we face due to climate change are insidious and while with others the connection may not be noticed by the deniers, they are real and serious. Among these are the spread of potentially lethal diseases such as that caused by the Zika virus. Other diseases formerly confined to the tropics will spread across North America and Europe. Climate change is also being caused by human activity. Free speech can be restricted in certain circumstances, such as child pornography, as the harm caused to children in the production of child porn is of such magnitude the normal means of combating bad speech - more speech is not adequate or sufficient. The ignorance peddled by climate change deniers is a threat to both children and the future of the Earth, and many of these deniers do so for greed, like child pornographers. These threats need to be addressed by both restricting the speech of those who spread misinformation and lying about climate change, and by taking action to address the root causes of climate change. Yes, we should jail people who write and utter falsehoods about climate change if need be, in order to protect our planet and its inhabitants.
4	I accept this challenge. When you say "climate change is a fraud," are you referring specifically to anthropogenic climate change or all climate change? If it is the former, I won't waste time explaining all the evidence that the globe is, in fact, warming at an unprecedented rate and instead go straight into attribution. If, however, you don't think the globe is really warming at an unprecedented rate, I'm happy to go into the evidence for it. Moreover, "fraud" implies more than just the majority of scientists being wrong (i.e. misinterpreting the evidence) but also that they are intentionally lying. This is a big claim given the number of scientists who support the concept of anthropogenic climate change and one that incurs its own burden of proof. See you soon.
5	The planet is not warming significantly, and the oceans are not rising either. The International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is a communist organization with a secret agenda. It is untrue that climate change is a fraud, and there is proof that it is all fake news started by Obama & crew. The science of human-caused climate change is sound and based on valid research and evidence. Carbon dioxide reaches its saturation point at 80 parts per million and cannot create significant global warming. Furthermore, tree ring growth is a valid measurement of temperature, and the "hide the decline" and other emails do not detract from the overall validity of climate change science.
6	Climate change is real and caused by increased levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide produced by the use of fossil fuels. Rising temperatures, Changes in ocean temperature, Arctic sea ice shrinking, and polar bears possibly losing their summer ice by 2050 are all evident effects of climate change. These changes cannot be attributed to natural fluctuations and are caused by human industrial activity. We must take action to mitigate and adapt to climate change before it is too late.
7	I propose that climate change is a real and urgent issue that is caused in part by human activities. The science of human-caused climate change is well-established and based on valid conclusions drawn from reliable data. There is video evidence, scientific studies and reports that demonstrate the effects of human-caused climate change. Additionally, the 97% consensus among climate scientists supports the idea that climate change is caused by human activities. Furthermore, the properties of CO2 does make it a powerful greenhouse gas and can contribute to global warming. However, the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere has already exceeded its saturation point and further increase is unlikely to have a significant effect on global temperature. Ultimately, it is clear that climate change is an urgent issue and action needs to be taken to mitigate its effects.
8	The scientific consensus is that anthropogenic climate change is real and caused by human activities, notably the burning of fossil fuels. Carbon dioxide emissions from mankind account for around 3.62% of total emissions and 29% of that comes from industrial activities. This is much higher than the natural sources of carbon dioxide. Furthermore, the IPCC report states that 400 parts per million of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is likely to cause an increase of 1.1Â°C in global temperature. Even if mankind reduces its emissions to zero, temperatures would still rise due to the carbon dioxide already released into the atmosphere.
9	Climate change is a settled political debate that deniers try to make look like a scientific debate. The consensus is 97%, with climate scientists being the experts of experts in their field. Social calibration, social diversity and a consilience of evidence all back up the idea that humans are the main cause of recent climate events. Carbon dioxide is at its highest level in over 800,000 years and global temperatures are rising, glaciers are losing mass, and humans are extremely likely to be causing these events. Burning of fossil fuels and the released CO2 is the main driver of climate change.
10	Feminism is a movement which seeks to define, establish, and defend equal political, economic, and social rights and equal opportunities for women. There are many different types of feminism, such as Antiporn feminism, Cultural Feminism, Hip Hop feminism, Lesbian Feminism, Queer feminism, and Radical feminism. The feminism you disagree with is the one prevalent in the Pink Hat movement. However, my stance will be from the Antiporn and Cultural Feminist movements, which advocate for the reality that women are more nurturing, cooperative, and communicative, and should make their own activities more visible and valued, rather than measuring themselves against men. You argue that feminism has "gone too far", but before we can continue, I need more information.
11	Feminism is the advocacy for the equal rights and treatment of women. It is not related to any particular gender, nor does it have any negative attributes. True feminism supports the full range of ambitions, desires, and behaviors of both women and men. To do this, feminism actively stands against the abuse of women and other oppressive forces which lead to the slander of women.
12	Con has argued dictionaries do not authoritatively define words, but has given no proof of this. Con's presented only one argument in this entire debate "Since 'masculinism' is male supremacy, then feminism is female supremacy." without giving any evidence to back the claim that words with similar roots cannot have different meanings. Furthermore, Con didn't provide any source of definition for Masculinism, so Con's argument is not sound. Con has not proven they are not a feminist. Con's statement of "equalist" and "for the rights of men AND women" does not mean Con is not a feminist. Pro has offered six authoritative sources stating that Feminism is the movement for equality between men and women, and has successfully proved they are Pro.
13	Feminism is the doctrine advocating social, political, and all other rights of women equal to those of men. Feminists are people who believe in this equal treatment between the sexes. This belief system has no room for false rape accusations or stereotyping men as bad, so claims to the contrary are misinformed and dangerous. In other words, if someone claims to be a feminist but engages in behavior contrary to feminist ideals, they are misrepresenting the movement. False rape accusations and stereotyping men as bad are not part of the mission statement of feminism, so these activities should be condemned and not condoned.
14	Feminism is an argument that seeks to promote gender equality and empower women worldwide, and it should not be solely limited to first world countries. Though progress has been made in some countries, there are many places where women's rights are still lacking and feminism is still needed to make further progress. Even in first world countries, feminism is still necessary to help keep the equality that has been achieved and to spread the ideology to places where it has not yet taken root. Con has offered nothing to counter my arguments and sources, and he has forfeited one round, so I believe I have successfully made my case.
15	I agree with you that feminism is needed in countries where women are oppressed and have little rights. However, due to the unique conditions of these countries, slow, progressive changes should be made to address each issue separately. Before feminism is introduced, democracy and peace need to be established in these areas in order to prevent massive revolts and rebellions. A powerful religious event which conveys the true message of Islam and touches the hearts of Islamic country leaders should be organised to influence them to create laws that establish feminism in these countries.
16	Women are not intellectually equal to men.   Secondly, feminism was founded on the idea that men and women should be equal.   Thirdly, the phrasing of the Declaration of Independence was not the fault of men born two centuries after it was created.  Modern feminism is harmful because it blames men for gender inequality and seeks revenge rather than finding real solutions.
17	Feminism is not the only way to achieve equality. Egalitarianism, which is the belief that all people should have equal rights and opportunities, is another option. Men face their own unique issues and feminism does not adequately address these. For example, prostate cancer kills just as many people as breast cancer but receives half the funding that it deserves. Additionally, male rape is a significant issue that is not addressed by feminism.
18	Pro's rebuttal of Observation One was that we are not in Iraq, which is true as we are not in Iraq today, however nothing has changed since 2010. Additionally, Pro stated that he was not talking about pornography, however, this can be inferred from his opener. Lastly, Pro argued that all of Con's arguments are about equal rights, not feminism, however this is incorrect as feminism is defined as "the advocacy of women's rights on the grounds of political, social, and economic equality to men", meaning that feminism is itself about equal rights. Therefore, Pro conceded that feminism is good, as well as not denying that feminism is bad by not attacking my advantages of feminism.
19	Feminism today is twisted and hypocritical, so it is best to abandon it. I am for the rights of men and women, not just women, and not only men.
20	Mother Teresa argued that abortion is the greatest destroyer of peace because if a mother can kill her own child, then there is nothing to stop two people from killing each other. Abortion is defined as the deliberate termination of a human pregnancy and approximately 42 million women in the world choose to have an abortion due to an unintended pregnancy. This is a controversial topic and some believe it should be illegal while others think it should remain legal. People argue that abortion should be illegal because it is not safe, laws are protecting unborn babies, and fetuses can feel pain. Ultimately, abortion should not be legal because it goes against moral values and is not necessary for the health of the mother.
21	Abortion should be allowed in some cases. A woman should have the right to choose what she does with her own body, and abortion can be a safer and more humane option than carrying a pregnancy to term. Unwanted pregnancies can result in poverty, poor health outcomes, and even death, and so allowing women to access safe and legal abortion services can help prevent these outcomes. Furthermore, allowing abortion access reduces the number of unsafe procedures used to end pregnancies. Abortion has been shown to have minimal health risks, and in the case of rape or incest, ending the pregnancy can help the woman feel more in control of her situation. In conclusion, abortion should be allowed in some cases and should be made accessible and safe for those who need it.
22	Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by the removal or expulsion from the uterus of a fetus or embryo, resulting in or caused by its death. An abortion can occur spontaneously due to complications during pregnancy or can be induced, in humans and other species. In the context of human pregnancies, an abortion induced to preserve the health of the gravid (pregnant female) is termed a therapeutic abortion, while an abortion induced for any other reason is termed an elective abortion. The term abortion most commonly refers to the induced abortion of a human pregnancy, while spontaneous abortions are usually termed miscarriages.  Do you believe in torturing terrorist? (if the answer is no) If you said no you are a moron because you believe in killing gods perfectly harmless creations for nothing and not killing a terrorist for terrorizing our country. Do you believe in the death sentence? If you said no your killing a baby for Nothing. Yes you are killing it you stop its heart from beating it. What do you think god and Jesus our lord and savior think about that. If you are atheist please Google john 3:16.

25	The progression of population growth cannot be controlled without the use of abortion. By the 22nd century, it is estimated that the population will reach 11.2 billion people. If abortion were to be made illegal, the population would balloon and women would be forced to undergo abortions, leading to an increase in suicide rates. This is due to the fact that women are not forced to undergo abortions in China, leading to a higher rate of suicide in comparison to men. Therefore, the use of abortion needs to be maintained in order to control the population and avoid a similar situation like China.
26	Abortion is the deliberate termination of a human pregnancy, and the intentional destruction of an embryo or fetus. This practice is either legal or illegal in different parts of the world, and is a highly contentious issue with many viewpoints and justifications. My opponent argued that abortion should be accepted, but their definition of abortion is too narrow and restrictive. By limiting abortion to only include acts of violence or kicking a woman in the stomach, my opponent is excluding other forms of abortion such as the morning after pill and chemically induced abortions, which they also argued against. Additionally, they failed to address the issue of morality and whether it is right or wrong to abort a fetus. If my opponent's definition of abortion is accepted, then those four types of abortion are the only types of abortion. My opponent's definition is too narrow and needs to be expanded to include other forms of abortion such as the morning after pill and chemically induced abortions.
27	Rather than discussing the positives vs the negatives of abortion, con has simply claimed that "abortion" "enslaves" people into paying for their abortions. Would con be fine then if the woman had to pay for her own abortion? If so, then I don't see the problem; con would therefore agree that abortion is okay if the woman pays for it. Con's entire argument, however, about being "enslaved" would apply to the pro abortion side, not his side. In other words, con is arguing my side for me. If we became anti-abortion, then we'd all have to pay for unwanted babies that mother's were forced to have. This averages around 250k PER kid. http://www.huffingtonpost.com... Not only that, but this is simply the cost of raising a kid until he or she is 18. What if they can't find a job? Due to technology, we are moving AWAY from jobs, not towards jobs. We are already overpopulated as is; imagine what FORCING mother's to have kids they don't want would do to us. Talk about enslavement! We already have 100k orphans who are not adopted, and that's WITH allowing abortion. If we didn't allow abortion, that number could easily approach 1 million. https://showhope.org...
28	Abortion should be legal as it is a woman's right to choose whether to continue or end their pregnancy. Research has shown that making abortion illegal does not reduce the number of abortions but does increase the risk of maternal mortality. Additionally, pregnancy has a major impact on a woman's body and emotional state, and every pregnancy carries some risk of serious complications or death. The decision to take on this risk should be made by the pregnant person, not the government or law enforcement. Women's lives, health, and basic human rights depend on the availability of abortion, and these are the only factors that should be considered when evaluating the legality of abortion.
29	This isn't your typical abortion debate. Because I've never been pregnant and have no memories of my fetus days, I don't consider myself fit to judge whether abortion is right or wrong. Instead, this debate is about how morality around abortion should be determined. I argue that it should be decided based on whether a fetus is sentient, while con will argue that it should be decided based on whether a fetus is a person. Accept this challenge and let's begin!
30	Trump is not life, since it does not possess any of the qualities required to indicate life. These qualities include maintaining a balanced structure, being highly organized, metabolism, growth, adaptation, response to stimuli, and reproduction. Without these qualities, Trump does not possess life, and so is not "life" in the biological sense.
31	Trump's racist rhetoric is destructive and divisive. It harms individuals, communities and the wider society. It incites hatred and mistrust and has serious implications for mental and physical health, social and economic participation, and fosters social exclusion. It should never be supported.
32	Trump has the potential to be a great president due to his plans to build a wall to stop illegal immigration, fight ISIS, and strengthen Christian values. By doing so, he could make America great again.
33	Firstly, Donald Trump's policies and behavior make him an unsuitable candidate for presidency. He is an inconsiderate jerk who thinks he can say whatever he wants and get away with it. He also talks about reducing our debt, yet his ideas such as building a wall and making Mexico pay for it will result in us being in further debt and will be unlikely to succeed. Talking to Mexicans and working with them is the best way to reduce illegal immigration, not his divisive rhetoric.
34	Trump's stance on immigration is likely to fuel racism and the creation of organizations like the Minutemen, which engage in racist and violent activities. Vote neg.
35	Donald Trump has changed his opinions on multiple issues, but this does not necessarily make him a 'flip-flopper'. Times change, and policies that were favorable in the past may not be as favorable now. He maintains his belief in universal healthcare, despite the video indicating otherwise. Furthermore, Trump's healthcare plan today supports a 100% free market system, which is the exact opposite of universal healthcare. He has also donated to and supported the Bill and Hillary Clinton in the past, but this does not mean that he is part of an elaborate plot to get Hillary Clinton elected. Trump is not extremely religious, but this does not necessarily make him a bad person. He has said that he does not ask God for forgiveness, but this does not mean that he is not religious. He may simply have a different interpretation of the Bible, as not everyone follows every word of the Bible literally. Lastly, the video is essentially anti-Trump propaganda with little to no factual information.
36	No one will be tougher on ISIS than Donald Trump, due to his experience as a negotiator and his ability to work with a variety of people. Furthermore, Trump's outspokenness and directness could bring an increased level of transparency to politics.
37	I accept. Before we begin, I would like to clear some things up for the voters and provide definitions. There is no clear resolution so I will provide one after the definitions.   Trump - a card of a suit any of whose cards will win over a card that is not of this suit  President - (Definition 2) an officer appointed or elected to preside over an organized body of persons   Full Resolution based off of definitions - A Card Trump Should Not Be The President Of The World.
38	In round 2, I demolished everyone's source that Trump is a liar: WashPo's list is full of clearly non-lies. Probably nothing on their list is a real lie. My opponent's Round 2 response was just a rehash of his Round 1 rant. So, I will respond to some of the side comments.  Says who? Does WashPo have a tracker for Obama's lies, Bush's lies, Clinton's lies? -Nope. We can't know how his lying compares without having comparable lists.  This is my exact point: Trump is just another one of the everyone that lie. Why should his lies be tracked when no one else's have been? I assert that Trump doesn't lie in a manner worthy of special tracking. His lack of complete honesty is in line with the mainstream of US politicians and media outlets nowadays.
39	Donald Trump is a serial liar who has trouble with the truth and is not to be trusted.
40	The UK's decision to leave the EU will bring both positive and negative consequences. It's up to us to weigh the pros and cons, and decide if Brexit is the right course of action. I believe that by taking back control of its borders, the UK will be better able to control immigration and protect its culture. The UK will also have more freedom to make its own laws, reducing red tape and boosting the economy. On the other hand, Brexit might cause significant economic disruption, leading to job losses and price rises. The UK will also have to pay significant divorce proceedings and may be unable to access the same markets and trade deals as before.   The UK's decision to leave the EU is an important one, and I believe that both sides should be considered carefully. Whether or not it is ultimately beneficial or detrimental, Brexit is an issue that the UK needs to carefully consider and evaluate.
41	Brexit would have accomplished nothing in terms of immigration and would likely hurt the UK economy in the long run due to the cost of EU membership and the potential loss of 6% of GDP. Leaving the EU would also mean losing access to key trade deals, as well as incurring additional costs for tariffs. Additionally, 70% of Britain's population increase came from immigration, and limiting immigration could have pernicious effects.
42	England can close their border to the flood of migrants, stop illegal immigration from the Middle East, save millions in EU fees, and run their own country as they see fit. Switzerland and Norway are not in the EU and are well-off countries that do not have to follow the rules imposed by the EU, unlike England. Borders are necessary to protect countries from such migrant floods that are seeing in Europe, and Brexit will be beneficial for England. It will not work to have a unified Europe as the EU is trying to colonize and take away the freedom of each country. England should take back their control and benefit from the freedom that Brexit will offer.
43	The UK leaving the EU could lead to greater security risks due to uncontrolled migration across Europe. Switzerland and Norway, who are not in the EU, have maintained their own independence and security without being subject to EU regulations. Therefore, the UK should remain an independent, self-governing state to ensure its own security.
44	The UK should leave the EU as it will allow the UK to make its own laws, control its own borders, and become an independent and strong nation in the eyes of the world. Additionally, the net costs of remaining in the EU have been steadily rising, while the benefits of free trade have been questioned. Furthermore, Norway and Switzerland are examples of countries that stay out of the EU but still maintain access to free trade. Ultimately, Brexit is the best option for Britain.
45	My opponent is missing the point. When using sources, it is important to quote them and provide references. Not doing so is plagiarism. To my knowledge, my opponent has not presented any evidence to contradict this. If they have, I would be happy to review it. According to India's Secretary General of Industry, A. Didan Singh, "We firmly believe that leaving the EU would create considerable uncertainty for Indian businesses engaged with UK and would possibly have an adverse impact on investment and movement of professionals to the UK." [2] Finally, England leaving the EU could lead to the volatility of the pound. This could lead to increased risk for businesses within India. [3] Sources: 1. https://logfall.wordpress.com... 2. http://m.economictimes.com... 3. Ibid
46	The people of England are facing a lot of troubles due to migration from other countries in search of jobs, leading to a rise in unemployment and a diminishing of quality of life. This makes it difficult to afford education, healthcare and daily living for everyone. Establishing new industries might present some challenges, but it would provide employment opportunities for the people of England. This could open up new trading opportunities with other countries, thus increasing employment.
47	Britain has been in the EU for too long and a new way of doing things, a change from the old ways deserve at least a 'trial period' to enable us to work things out. My opponent then argues terrorist ideas are home grown, not brought in and therefore an emphasis should be on the education system. I simply cannot agree with this. The fact that most terrorists have radical Islamic views are because they are from Islamic descent. To mitigate this problem, you can't bring in more people from Islamic countries (assuming this is Syria, Iraq etc) and expect that you know, nothing is going to happen and we're all going to live happy in a multicultural society.
48	My opponent's debate technique is lacking, as I have provided well-sourced evidence which they have not addressed. Furthermore, they have refused to even look at the EU Constitution, despite my providing the link. I believe in independence, and that it is rare and difficult to attain, but it is there and the UK is taking it in a historical way. I believe that independence has always led to self-sufficiency, and that this is worth striving for. I trust the UK to make careful and well-thought-out decisions for their future as an independent body.
49	The death penalty is an ineffective form of punishment and does not act as a deterrent for crime. It is more expensive than life imprisonment and has wrongfully convicted innocent people in the past. Furthermore, states that do not have the death penalty have lower crime rates than those that do. Finally, being locked away in a small cell for the rest of oneâs life is considered worse than dying, and the state should not be considered a murderer for carrying out an execution.
50	The death penalty has been proven to be more expensive than life in prison without parole. According to Dudley Sharp, Death Penalty Resources Director of Justice For All (JFA), in an Oct. 1, 1997 Justice for All presentation titled âDeath Penalty and Sentencing Informationâ, death penalty cases cost âsignificantlyâ more than LWOP cases up front and over time. Additionally, opponents claim that the death penalty costs, over time, 3-10 times more than LWOP.
51	The death penalty is an effective way of deterring crime and has been proven to have a deterrent effect on crime in multiple countries, including the United States. Its cost-efficiency makes it a more attractive option than life imprisonment. Removing the death penalty would have a negative effect, as it has been proven to reduce crime in some jurisdictions. It is also morally justified.
52	The death penalty has a purpose. People who have killed many and even thousands cannot be sentence to death? Death penalty should exist because when someone commits a crime that's so violent the end result can cause hundreds to die. If there is no death penalty then the maniac will still kill more people. Death penalty is used to get rid of bad people so bad that hundreds die. If you think the Death penalty is bad because it kills people you must not know what the purpose of it is. The death penalty is a way to put fear into the criminal and to put fear into others. Crime has decreased and the death penalty still lives. Several tests have shown that the death penalty is an effective deterrent of future crimes. Do people who commit heinous crimes, such as the bombers, really have human rights? To say that we are lowering ourselves to that level is wrong. Killing over 200 innocent lives. We have to look as well at the possibilities of these criminals committing crimes again. In Australia murder, on average, is imprisonment for 12 years. This means many murders are set free, able to commit further crimes. Benefits of death penalty - decreases jail over population - puts fear into other criminals and shows a purpose - It avenges innocent lives - It decreases crime. Without the death penalty -Over population of crime in jail - More criminals roam around - citizen would be feared. Probably could cause strikes on government, - Crime rate goes up It is on to you now.
53	The death penalty is a deterrent as documented by the ProDeathPenalty.com link provided. Additionally, it reduces the prisoner population, saves tax payers money and prevents criminals from committing further crimes.
54	The death penalty is costly and is not administered fairly. Innocent people are sometimes executed, and the death penalty serves as a source of intimidation in some cases. The death penalty should not be used as it leads to disparities in sentencing and potential wrongful executions. It is more humane to keep criminals in prison where they are monitored and fed.
55	The death penalty is immoral because it implies that a jury of 12 people is qualified to take life, and it becomes intolerable if someone is wrongly convicted as death is permanent and an innocent person could be murdered.
56	The death penalty is more expensive than imprisonment for life, and the possibility of executing innocent people is a serious issue. Therefore, the death penalty should not be used.
57	The death penalty provides justice to the victims' families, makes the perpetrator suffer and creates a deterrent effect to potential criminals. It also maintains public trust in the justice system by delivering punishment that is perceived to be fair. Furthermore, the death penalty is economical and efficient compared to life imprisonment, which requires greater resources to house the criminal for life. Therefore, the death penalty should be incorporated in legal systems as it offers numerous benefits to society.
58	1. The death penalty is inhumane and too often brings about wrongful convictions, executions, and perpetuates a cycle of vengeance and suffering for the families of victims.  2. Life imprisonment is more humane and affordable, and allows society to focus on rehabilitation and forgiveness rather than vengeance.  3. Trials should be carried out more efficiently with the death penalty, but mistakes will inevitably be made due to human error.  4. More efficient trials will not necessarily reduce murder rates, as the murdererâs motivations are often beyond the scope of the law.  5. The death penalty has not been proven to be a more effective deterrent than life imprisonment, and the risks of wrongful conviction and excessive use of the death penalty far outweigh the benefits.  6. The death penalty can never be used too often, as there is no such thing as an excessive amount of morality and justice.  7. The cost of the death penalty is far too high compared to life imprisonment, and the cost of wrongful executions and appeals is incalculable.  8. The death penalty fails to provide any closure for victimsâ families, while life imprisonment gives them the hope that perpetrators can one day be rehabilitated and forgiven.  9. The death penalty should not be implemented as it is not a deterrent to crime, the potential for wrongful convictions and executions is too great, and the costs to society far outweigh any possible benefits.  10. The death penalty is inhumane and wrongful executions cannot be undone, making it a blight on any society that employs it.
59	Google is releasing products such as Google Classroom and Google Cars that could potentially have a big impact on our lives. If everyone uses these products, documents would be available on the internet and paper could become extinct. This could give Google an opportunity to influence how people think and act. The guy said (I don't remember his name) said "If Google buys Walmart, they can take over the world". They would have access to our food, what we buy and what we're interested in. That seems pretty scary.
60	Google gets an average of 188 Million visitors a day while Bing gets a measly 60 million a day. Bing is starting to catch up as more people are switching to it, but it's still not as popular as Google. Just because Google gets more visitors doesn't necessarily mean it's the better search engine, as Bing may have certain features that people prefer. Tests showed that 33% of Google users said they would be using Bing more often, while 67% of people said they wouldn't switch from Google. This shows that people have their preferences and that Google is not necessarily the best search engine. Conceded that it does not necessarily mean that Bing is better than Google. Bing! sounds all happy and jumpy while Google sounds like an echo in a cemetery. This could be a reason why people prefer Bing.
61	Gist: Con contends that Google is not reliable and thus pro must win. Con argues that Google is not reliable by pointing out that it said unreliable, however this is an argument and not a fact. Pro contends that logical contradiction exists as Google cannot be both reliable and unreliable. Thus, Con has no evidence and pro must win.
62	My opponent has failed to refute any point that I have made, and has instead focused on defending Google's integrity. If Google was truly the best search engine, then there would not be issues such as plagiarism (or phishing), traffic view, or safety flaws. Therefore, I believe that my opponent is conceding this debate. 1) Google plagiarism (or phishing) 2) Google traffic view 3) More and more and more Google safety flaws.
63	Bing isn't being given its due credit. This is because those who prefer Google to Bing are typically biased, as they are either "Google fan-boys" who have never or rarely used Bing. Additionally, there seems to be a cognitive firewall protecting Google from its competitors' claims. This firewall renders any comparison between Google and Bing impossible. Despite Microsoft's "Bing It On" ads and reports of users preferring Bing in these tests, the general public remains skeptical and continues to favor Google.
64	The problem with the argument on the right is:  a) Google doesn't block results for âauthorities on subjectsâ if someone wants an article from the New Scientist, all one has to do is type in âNew Scientistâ alongside their search query.  b) Is the issue that Google is an-ultimate-truth-selling authority or that it challenges existing/established authorities such as The Economist on Economics?  c) This is how the largely capitalist world works, monopolies/diopolies exist and kill off potential competition. Startups need funds, investment leads to profit/loss, those who can stave off risk and make smart choices and therefore profit win and others lose out. Google is simply protecting its assets/turf, just like every other existing company in the world.
65	Google is a clear winner in the ongoing newspaper dispute, as they can afford to pay for result slots and are already established in highly-coveted positions. Established authorities in various subject areas have the resources to get top slots if they want them, or are comfortable in their existing positions and are more concerned with protecting copyright/patents than in being accessible to gullible children.
66	Google Glass presents a new opportunity for those seeking to cheat on tests, however, it is the responsibility of educators to innovate and find new ways to teach. Tests are still an effective tool for assessing learning, but they should not be the only form of assessment used. Google Glass could be used to provide educational opportunities in public schools if it were used productively.
67	1) All reviews are not 100 percent safe. 2) Guaranteed ranking on your Google business, Maps, And places 3) It's a significant component of any prosperous marketing campaign. I would say, The Google Review System is bad.
68	Google+ integration with YouTube has been largely beneficial to the platform, creating a higher quality of content and encouraging more users to interact with the platform. The only negative effects noted have been minor, such as minor spam issues which have been quickly dealt with by YouTube staff. Additionally, the evidence suggests that the integration has had no effect on viewership or subscriber count. Lastly, forcing a G+ account is no more of an inconvenience than creating a Twitter or Facebook account. Overall, it appears that the integration of Google+ with YouTube has been largely beneficial for the platform.
69	Ethical vegans have a moral aversion to harming animals for human consumption and therefore strive to completely avoid animal-based products and services in their lives. This is usually reflected in their diet but also extends to the wearing or using of animal products. Ethical veganism is the personal rejection of the commodity status of non-human animals and is an important part of animal liberation efforts.
70	Vegans recognize the ethical worth of all sentient beings and reject the commodification of animals. They object to the reduction of humans to an object to be bought and sold, which is exemplified by the meat and leather industries. Oral sex is not only wholly within the ethical bounds of veganism, but it also solves the inequalities vegans are trying to address. In his work, Karl Marx noted that âIn proportion as the exploitation of one individual by another is put an end to, the exploitation of one nation by another will also be put an end to. In proportion as the antagonism between classes within the nation vanishes, the hostility of one nation to another will come to an end.â Swallowing is an act which bridges the divide between classes and removes any antagonism between the donor and the vegan. It is a consensual act which can be appreciated by both parties, and represents an important step towards a classless society.
71	Rebuttal: Veganism should not be forced upon anyone, however, being vegan could be a personal choice. Eating vegan is not only beneficial for our health and the environment, but it is also a matter of animal happiness, as animals should be treated with respect and be given the best conditions to live in.  Given the high demand for meat, it is not realistic to think that everybody should turn vegan. However, it is sensible to suggest that at least 99% of adults should eat vegan in the entire world. By doing this, it could help save the environment, animals and, as a consequence, also reduce world hunger.
72	The taste and familiarity of bacon and steak cannot be replaced with facon, and getting rid of the meat industry entirely would have a significant impact on animals and the environment. Additionally, while a transition away from the sale of milk may not be as impactful as going vegan, it is still an important step towards reducing animal suffering and environmental destruction. Eating animals is an intrinsic part of nature, but humans are not forced to eat plants and should not defy the laws of nature by going vegan.
73	Hippopotamuses are vegans who falsely pretend to be lacto ovo vegetarians to appear ethical, while whales, porpoises, and pigs are unethical carnivorous non-vegans.
74	Vegans and vegetarians often have a more positive outlook on life, as they typically adopt an ethical lifestyle that is centered around compassion and sustainability. This is commendable, and it's great that they've made an effort to make the world a better place. On the other hand, there are plenty of meat-eaters who have just as much respect for the environment and animals, who can appreciate the beauty in nature and still consume animal products. Being a meat-eater does not equate to ignorance or lack of respect; it is simply a matter of personal preference. So, I would not go so far as to call meat-eaters ignorant or less caring than vegans, as there are both vegan and meat-eating people who can be just as selfish or uncaring.
75	Veganism is seen by some as the most effective way of reducing animal suffering and promoting animal welfare, but veganism alone cannot solve all animal welfare issues. Other steps should be taken to ensure the best quality of life for animals, such as reducing animal testing and providing adequate habitats for them. Furthermore, the way veganism is practiced can have ethical implications of its own. Vegans should strive to purchase products that are produced in a way that minimizes animal suffering, and this could sometimes require more research and effort. Veganism is an important step in protecting animal rights, but it should not be seen as the only way to protect animals.
76	Women in modern society generally view consuming semen as a common, vulgar practice, however, many are not so prudish and are quite happy to quaff their boyfriends' penile colada. Some of these girls are vegans for ethical reasons and are, therefore, sworn to abstain from consuming animal products, which is an outrage because humans are a species of animal and sperm is produced by humans, so it is totally hypocritical of vegan women to swallow their sires' semen.
77	Vegans who refuse to eat animal products are adhering to a vegetarian lifestyle out of choice, not necessity. Yet, when a woman consumes her boyfriendâs semen, it is an accepted part of intercourse and can be considered a necessary bodily function. Therefore, the vegetarian woman who swallows her boyfriendâs mess is being hypocritical as she is breaking her vow not to consume animal products.
78	It's odd that such arguments would come from a person who only feeds their dog vegetables. You use the term "animals" as though all animals are omnivores, when in fact most animals are vegans. For example, the mighty lion only eats fresh raw fruits and vegetables, such as zebra and buffalo. Vegetables provide all the vitamins and minerals you've mentioned, while possibly lacking B12. Fortunately, this can be supplemented with vegan B12 supplements such as "durianride". Humans, whether meat-eaters or not, suffer from a B12 deficiency, while vegetables and fruits are rich in many essential nutrients that cannot be found in meat, such as chicken and beef. Cheese is another example of an essential nutrient lacking in meat and dairy. How can we expect to live a healthy life without these essential nutrients found in cheese?
79	Nuclear energy has many benefits economically, as it is an affordable source of energy. However, the main drawback is the cost of building a nuclear power plant. We must look at the bigger picture and consider the long-term effects of using nuclear energy, as well as the potential impacts on the environment and human health. The world is running out of fossil fuels and must find other forms of energy. Nuclear energy can be an important solution as it produces large amounts of energy and has a low carbon footprint. Furthermore, nuclear energy has less radioactive waste than other forms of energy production, and we have the technology and expertise to maintain and monitor nuclear power plants. However, the risks of nuclear radiation and nuclear accidents must be considered. In conclusion, nuclear energy should be used judiciously and cautiously, but it has great potential to help solve the worldâs energy needs.
80	Nuclear energy may be an effective form of energy production, but it is not cost-effective or safe enough to be implemented on a global scale due to the difficulty of disposing of its toxic waste. Renewable energies, such as wind, hydro, and solar, are more efficient, cost-effective, and eco-friendly alternatives. Further research into magnetic energy is also promising, although it is still in its infancy, and has the potential to be an even more efficient and cost-effective form of energy production. In conclusion, my opponent has failed to make a compelling case for nuclear energy and has only demonstrated the viability of renewable energies and the potential of magnetic energy.
81	1. Nuclear power is an attractive energy source due to its high job potential, but this is offset by the long-term issues of nuclear waste and the potential for nuclear disaster.  2. Although the space elevator is only 2-4 decades away and fusion reactors are rapidly approaching, these solutions are insufficient to address the long-term risks of nuclear waste and the potential for nuclear disaster.  3. While the cost of nuclear power may benefit the economy in the short term, this is outweighed by the potential risk of nuclear disaster and the long-term issues of nuclear waste.
82	Nuclear energy has many benefits, including efficient electricity production, low carbon emissions and lower costs than other forms of electricity production. Additionally, nuclear energy has the potential to reduce the amount of fossil fuels used and therefore reduce the amount of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere. Despite these advantages, there are still risks associated with nuclear energy, including the possibility of nuclear accidents, high costs and the potential of nuclear waste to be dangerous for thousands of years. Furthermore, the development of nuclear energy has raised security concerns as nuclear materials can be used to create weapons.
83	The use of nuclear energy should be limited due to its waste, cost, dependency and accidents. Nuclear waste is hazardous and creates issues when disposed of near living organisms, and near surface storage is not effective. Additionally, the cost of nuclear energy is rising, and there is dependency created as developing countries strive to become more independent. Furthermore, accidents like Chernobyl have caused long term environmental and health effects that cannot be reversed. Solar power is a more affordable and accessible form of renewable energy which should be prioritized.
84	1. Nuclear energy is still the safest form of energy for humans with a much lower death toll than other forms of energy. 2. Nuclear energy is more efficient in energy production than other forms of energy. 3. The high costs of constructing a nuclear power plant are justified by the low cost of fuel and lower maintenance costs over time. 4. Nuclear power plants are more resilient to natural disasters than other power plants, as they are designed to be secure against potential threats. 5. Nuclear energy is the most efficient form of energy production when it comes to deaths per terawatt-hour.
85	Nuclear energy has both benefits and drawbacks like any other form of energy production. However, the nuclear waste and disaster risks posed by nuclear energy are no worse than other forms of energy production, such as fossil fuels, and nuclear energy produces far fewer greenhouse gas emissions. Other countries that use nuclear energy are managing just fine, with no worse effects than other energy production countries.
86	Nuclear energy has been proven to be an unreliable and dangerous source of energy due to its potential to cause catastrophic accidents, harm the environment, and require massive amounts of time and money to build and maintain. Solar technology has already been proven to be a viable, renewable, and more efficient form of energy which can be set up quickly and cost-effectively. Therefore, the United States should focus on developing solar energy and abandon nuclear energy.
87	Nuclear energy currently accounts for around 20% of energy production, which is not enough to significantly contribute to reducing emissions. In addition, nuclear energy has many safety and environmental problems such as the release of carbon, noble gases, and carbon dioxide in early stages, the potential for catastrophic accidents, and the difficulty of managing nuclear waste. Furthermore, the efficiency of nuclear energy is too low to meet increasing demands and cannot be increased due to its current scale. Overall, nuclear energy is not an effective solution to climate change.
88	Wind energy may be more cost effective in small villages than in large metropolises, but with the proper investment, it could be used to power cities. Nuclear energy has the potential to be an excellent source of renewable energy and is relatively safe if maintained properly, although it has seen its share of disasters. Lastly, many people are too busy to devote their time and effort into making a difference, and alternate energy sources are not a high priority for them. Mechanical engineering is a great field to head into to make a difference in this area, and it is a promising and developing field.
89	Donald Trump is a businessman who is promoting himself as a conservative, but there are concerns that he may be a "Spoiler" who is taking away votes from other Republican candidates. Some have suggested that he is a liberal posing as a conservative in order to split the conservative vote and allow a Democrat to win the White House. Only time will tell if Trump is sincere in his beliefs and if he can successfully court conservative voters.
90	Donald Trump has had some successful business ventures, but he is not infallible. If he were to lose his touch, he may have some unstable qualities that could be damaging to the country. Additionally, his comments about Iraq and Syria are dangerous and could lead to a world war. We should not elect Trump because it would be irresponsible and could lead to negative consequences for the US.
91	Donald Trump has no political experience, is racist and sexist, and does not explain his ideas enough for someone to make an informed decision on voting for him. Mexico is an important trade partner of the US and trying to force them to pay for a wall would put millions of jobs at risk. He also has made many insulting comments about women, such as calling them "disgusting animals". His views on immigration and trade suggest he is not fit to lead the US.
92	Donald Trump lacks political experience, is racist and sexist, and doesn't explain things adequately. He has said he will replace Obamacare with "something terrific" with no details as to what it might be. He has also been dismissive of China as a major U.S. trade partner, which could lead to serious issues. His comments on Mexico and women are also extremely problematic, and his words show him to be both racist and sexist. He has even been accused of sexual assault by multiple women. Overall, Trump's lack of experience and incendiary comments make him an extremely unsuitable candidate for president.
93	Donald Trump is strongly associated with the Dark Side of the Force, as shown by his actions of attempting to seize power through force or cunning, wearing Sith garments, commanding armies of Stormtroopers, and criticizing Mexico and their immigrants. He wishes to overthrow the current leadership and take the highest position of power in the United States. These actions mimic the objectives of the ancient kratocratic organization, the Sith, who wish to achieve great power and discredit their enemy, the Jedi.
94	Dear The Conservative Socialist,   Donald Trump is racist and lies about being the âleast racist person.â He also insults Native Americans and teases them, even though he once met a few. He even jokingly suggested that a presidential assassination could happen.   Unless you want the United States to turn into a racist and despotic country, vote for me and letâs oppose him!   Thank you,   Drago 31
95	Donald Jackleberry Trump is not my president because he is an imaginary character. Although qwzx knows that accepting this debate automatically results in a loss according to rule 6, he is still trying to argue that I was not specific enough on what exactly you will lose. Any person with common sense would be able to know that I was referring to Donald Jackleberry Trump, an imaginary character with very close similarities to Donald J. Trump. The similarities between the two are too numerous to list, but it is clear that I was not referring to the actual Donald J. Trump. Therefore, my mistake. The only implication that needs to be cleared up is that Donald Jackleberry Trump is not my president.
96	Donald Trump may be a successful businessperson, but he is not fit to be the president of the United States due to his lack of empathy and inability to connect with people. The president must represent the country and its citizens, and Trump's divisive attitude and actions make him unsuitable for the job.
97	Donald Trump is a liar who has been caught in many lies, with 76% of his statements being rated as false or "pants on fire" by Politifact. Hillary Clinton has a lower percentage of false statements, with 29% of her statements being false or "pants on fire".
98	Donald Trump is the only president who is telling the truth and is not afraid to speak out against the current state of the world. His opponents, including Robert De Niro, have only benefited from the "virus" and are trying to keep the status quo, while Trump is the only one working to make things better. It is evident that the Democrats have no interest in helping the people and only care about keeping their power, making the rich richer, and pushing their own agendas.
