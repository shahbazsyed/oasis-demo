Many of the threats we face due to climate change are insidious and while with others the connection may not be noticed by the deniers. But they are real and serious.

climate change,"The theory that CO2 is the dominant cause of global warming is based upon computer models that were derived under errant assumptions. The models have completely failed to predict the observed changes in climate. If CO2 was a significant cause of global warming, and CO2 theorists were correct that nothing else is presently affecting climate, then the predictions should have inescapably fallen into line. Over a period when the earth was supposed to warm by 5 degrees, it actually cooled by 3 degrees. In the history of the earth, the climate has warmed and cooled with apparent complete independence of CO2 levels. There was an ice age when CO2 levels were twelve times higher than at present. In the period of the Holocene Optimum, about 3,000 to 5,000 years ago, temperatures were warmer than CO2 models predict the earth will become in the future, but there was no human-produced CO2 to be blamed. The Holocene optimum was a time of human prosperity, and the polar bears paddled through it quite nicely. I presented scientific references in support of every one of these claims. Pro has not rebutted a single one of these assertions. He completely ignored most of them. Instead he focused on (1) asserting that the existence of the IPCC report proves a consensus among scientists, and that a consensus established scientific fact. He also (2) impugned the integrity of scientists who did not accept CO2 theory, claiming that the had all been bought off by the oil companies. Finally, he argued (3) that the climate on Venus proved that CO2 was a significant determinant of climate on present day earth. The IPCC Report The IPCC Report exists, however there is no evidence that it represents a consensus among climate scientists, or, more importantly that it represents the overwhelming consensus that Pro claims. I claimed that the IPCC was a political organization with only 30% of the members being actual climate scientists, that the report conclusions were written by a small number of people who required authors of individual sections to support their conclusions, that report was not subject to peer review, and that the contributing scientists were not allowed to vote on the accuracy of the report. Pro did not rebut a single one my claims; he only claimed that those criticisms were inconclusive. I provided reference to the book by Michaels on the IPCC process, the statements of John Christy (a lead author of the IPCC report), and the statement of Landsea, the hurricane expert who resigned in protest when the IPCC central committee changed his conclusion that hurricane activity was unrelated to CO2. Pro provided no contrary evidence. Climate change was recently debated by William Schlesinger and John Christy, both qualified climate scientists. http://www.johnlocke.org... Schlesinger claimed the IPCC report showed the kind of consensus Pro also claimed. Christy told the audience that as a lead author he knew it was political. After the debate, a question from the audience asked Schlesinger what percentage of the IPCC was composed of climate scientists. Schlesinger replied that there were many aspects to the science and that he didn't know for sure, but that ""perhaps 20% had something to do with climate."" This from a strong proponent of the theory. (Debate fans might find the whole debate worth watching. I think Christy won handily, and so did the audience.) The Integrity of Dissent Pro made the claim that the oil industry sponsored most of the research contradicting CO2 theory. I pointed out that NASA alone poured more that a hundred times Exxon's measly $1.6 million in the quest to prove CO2 theory. Counting all the sponsorship on both sides, the weight of sponsorship is undoubtedly many hundreds of times in favor of supporting CO2 theory. So I asked how it could be that opponents were easily corrupted, while proponents were immune. Pro did not respond beyond the implication that oil companies were evil. Beyond that I challenged Pro to explain how the peer review process for scientific journals allowed what Pro claimed to be bogus research to be published. Pro ignored my challenge and failed to provide any explanation as to how the peer review process was somehow corrupted. I think that scientists are subject to group think like others in society, but that the peer review process is fundamentally honest. Dissenting papers are published because they present data and analysis that stands up to scrutiny. Pro has no explanation that supports his theory of bogus science. The peer review process means that it makes no difference who sponsors research, the results stand on their own. Is Earth Like Venus? Pro originated the discussion of Venus, claiming that the temperature on Venus proved Earth's climate was sensitive to small changes in CO2 levels. I pointed out that 3500 times as much CO2 only produced a 150 degree rise, so it certainly didn't prove climate was sensitive to CO2. Pro responded that even though it wasn't sensitive overall, it might be sensitive at low levels. Yes, it might be, but is it? I presented a scientific paper that provided the physical basis for CO2 effects on earth, and then fit the actual data from the 20th century to the curve shape. The result showed that doubling CO2 on earth would produce less than a two degree temperature rise. In the detailed analysis, the curve on Venus would be different because (1) unlike Venus the dominant greenhouse gas on earth is water vapor, and (2) the atmosphere on Venus is about 100 times as dense. One might expect Pro to respond with a scientific paper on the CO2 theory as applied to earth's atmosphere that derives a different result. He did not. Pro simply asserted he was correct. I have looked for such a paper and never found one either. This is consistent with my assertion that CO2 theory does not derive from any simple physical theory, but rather from tweaking multiplier coefficients in computer models. I also referenced climate scientists (Spencer et al) that tweaking is how CO2 theory is derived. Throughout the debate, Pro referenced dubious Wikipedia articles, blog posts, and popular press articles instead of articles written by climate scientists. I challenged Pro several time to reference scientists and to point out exactly where in his references I could find support for his claims. He did not respond to any challenge. --- Pro's asserts CO2 is ""significant"" if it justifies enacting cap and trade legislation. Since past warm periods like the Medieval Warm Period and the much warmer Holocene Optimum were prosperous times for humanity, by that criteria the resolution fails even if CO2 causes global warming in the amounts postulated by the latest IPCC report. Besides, cap and trade does not lower CO2 levels, so it is never justified. I would allow a lesser criteria for ""significant,"" perhaps if half of global warming were due to CO2. If it were only half, that would be a devastating blow to the theory, since advocates claim there is no other source of climate change at present. If one looks at the observed climate data, it is unlikely that more than 10 percent is due to CO2. CO2 is increasing slowly and smoothly, but world temperatures are moving largely independently, with the last decade showing if anything a slight downward trend. If CO2 were to account for as much as half of climate change, the past decade would have shown a significant increase. The irradiance (heat output) of the sun also fails to explain climate change. Right now the best bet is that it changes in the sun's magnetosphere that drives climate. That tracks well with past and present climate. The Little Ice Age, for example, corresponded to a period of no sunspots. However, if that is not the significant factor in climate, then something unknown other than CO2, is.

climate change,"This such a broad topic it will be difficult to debate, but we'll have a go at it. It is certainly an issue that deserves attention, so it's a good topic. I agree with the contention that global warming exists. The earth has been warming at the rate of about 0.19 deg/decade since the end of the Little Ice Age in the early 1800s, well before human-produced CO2 could have been the cause. Climate change is the norm. The prior Medieval Warm Period, when Greenland was declared green, was about as warm as the present. Before that, the Holocene Optimum, about 3-5000 years ago was not only warmer than now, it was warmer than the dire global warming predictions forecast. [2a] Polar bears survived. I deny the contention that human-produced CO2 is a significant factor, although I allow that it may be a marginal contributor. The alleged scientific consensus is not meaningful, because the the consensus is largely determined by non-scientists and by scientists whose expertise is outside of fields relevant to climatology. The IPCC conclusions are determined by a dozen or so political zealots who write the conclusions and then force the scientists in charge of individual chapters to rewrite to support the conclusion the elite has reached. Only about 30% of the IPCC are scientists, the rest are government bureaucrats. The IPCC report is not subject to peer review and the scientists who contribute are not allowed to vote on whether it is reflects the consensus view or not. http://nzclimatescience.net... http://thewashingtonpest.blogspot.com... The professional societies operate in much the same fashion. The AAAS has only a few climate scientists, and the endorsement of climate change is done by the political elite, not by the climate scientists. Not too many years ago, the consensus of relevant mental health professionals was that homosexuality was a form of mental illness, and the learned societies officially endorsed that view. It was wrong. Similarly, the Steady State Theory of the universe was once the strong consensus view; that consensus didn't last. Recently, DOE Secretary Stephen Chu was asked by a Democrat if it was possible if global warming could possibly be ""a hoax."" Of course it isn't a hoax, because the people who believe in it are sincere. Chu himself endorses CO2 theory. Nonetheless, Chu was properly circumspect. He said (paraphrasing), ""In science we most honor the dissenters who disprove the consensus."" The highly publicized consensus in 1970 was that the earth was on the brink of a new ice age. The best estimates of the level of consensus I've seen are from Patrick Michaels, who worked on the IPCC reports, which can be combined with limited polling data. it's probably about 40% pro-CO2, 30% anti, and the rest ""maybe."" CO2 is a greenhouse gas, as Pro supposes. So if CO2 increases, say, 10%, then we ought to get something like 10% warming, right? No, that is not the way it works. A little bit of the CO2 in the atmosphere causes a relatively large amount of global warming, but as more is added the relative effect decreases dramatically. A straightforward physical model of the CO2 in the atmosphere shows that the increases in CO2 in the twentieth century would have a negligible direct effect on climate. To make the increases in CO2 have a significant effect, there has to be a multiplier that somehow magnifies the effect. There are many candidates for such a multiplier. For example, if somehow average cloud cover where reduced by a mere 2%, we would expect as much global warming as has been observed. It's no problem for guys with computers and hundreds of variables to tweak them to make the answer come out any way they want it to. The test as to whether they have it right is whether the models accurately predict what is observed. They do not. http://www.drroyspencer.com... There was a spike in temperatures in the mid to late 1990's. The models predicted a continual exponential rise in temperature. El Nino went away and temperatures subsided. Temperatures for the past decade have been about stable. If anything, they have decreased. http://www.drroyspencer.com... Atmospheric particulates were modeled to cause temperatures to decrease from 1930 to 1970, but that is no longer available to explain why temperatures are not increasing. Perhaps most telling, CO2 theory makes a strong prediction about the relative temperature rise in the lower, middle, and upper atmosphere and from pole to pole. The observations show the predictions to be wrong. [1a] Past climate change was probably due to solar activity, because there was insignificant human-produced CO2. Observations of the last few hundred years show solar effects correlate well with climate change. Unfortunately, solar activity turns out to need a multiplier just like CO2 theory. One explanation is that cosmic rays cause increased cloud formation, and the small changes in cloud formation produce the climate effects. This theory is not established, but there is a major test being conducted by CERN. Pro points to a feedback effect from CO2 being released from the ocean as the ocean is heated. This puts more CO2 in the air, which in turn causes more heating. The regenerative effect is such that once global warming starts, the world is guaranteed to end. But actually, there have been many instances of warming greater than the present, and the world did not end. The climate reversed and became colder despite the high CO2 levels. That means that whatever the contribution of CO2 to warming, there was something far greater that controlled climate, driving temperatures down despite CO2's best efforts to keep them up. The likely culprit is the Sun dominating climate. CO2 levels lag the rise and fall of temperatures by about 800 years. That implies that if multiplying effects of CO2 were significant, the earth could not have had temperature significant temperature changes in less than 800 years. Think in terms of an auto that has a 80 second lag in the accelerator. You floor the accelerator, and 80 seconds later you are up to 25 mph. With that kind of car, it isn't possible to get to 50 in just a few seconds. However, there are instances of dramatic climate change in around 50 years. The theory is therefore wrong. The Arctic Ice cap appears and disappears in roughly 60 year cycles. http://www.drroyspencer.com... The 60 year cycles track solar activity. Ships sailed across the Arctic Ocean in 1939, the last time the ice disappeared. Last winter was one of the coldest Arctic winters on record, with about a third of the ice refreezing. It appears the cycle has peaked and it heading colder. There is no sound evidence that weather is getting more violent due to global warming. [1c] In the last IPCC report, the executive committee demanded that the scientist in charge of the section on hurricanes attribute increase in hurricane activity to global warming. He refused and resigned in protest. http://sciencepolicy.colorado.edu... The scientific evidence now points to solar activity as the cause of present global warming as well as past global warming. There are multiple solar effects, including direct solar irradiance, cosmic ray effect induced by changes in the Sun's magnetosphere, and long term variations in the earth tilt and orbit. There are seven or more solar cycles that correlate well with past and present climate change. CO2 theory claims that CO2 now dominates climate, but in fact temperatures have been stable for a decade despite CO2 rise. 1. Michaels, P. J., Shattered Consensus (a) p246-51 2.

climate change,"Acknowledgement of opposing evidence I shall first bring up some evidence in favor of anthropogenic climate change. One may wonder why I would do this when I am arguing against anthropogenic climate change, but it’s really simple: I do this in order to provide the opposing side some representation and then I will present my side to refute that side’s argument. That is the most logical way of debating, and if you ignore evidence when it is available to you, that is a cherry-picking fallacy. The main evidence of anthropogenic climate change, is the increased levels of CO2 emissions within the past couple of centuries. It is believed that irreversible effects are occurring now and into the future due to increased CO2 emissions, and that this CO2 emission increase is due to primarily human activity [1]. In fact, in this study, it is shown that if humans were to cut all CO2 emissions the CO2 in the atmosphere would linger still and still cause more warming even if it were all put to an end. [1] There are of course plenty of other studies that show this as well. Refuting the scientific consensus There is often stated that 97% of climate scientists agree that anthropogenic climate change is real[2]. However, it is a fallacy to trust the words of authorities on the matter without considering the evidence. In a study conducted by John Cook et al, the same source that my opponent has cited, it was found that majority(66.7%) of studies in relation to anthropogenic climate change were either neutral or inconclusive.[3] One must wonder why 97% of climate scientists are of the opinion anthropogenic climate change is real when the majority of evidence out there is inconclusive and there is some scientific evidence(.7% of studies out there) that anthropogenic climate change is not real, which I shall point out later. In science, something needs to be tested over and over again and achieve the same results in order to conclude something off of it. The fact that U32; of anthropogenic climate change studies come up with inconclusive or neutral results indicates that we actually don’t understand the effects humans have on climate change, and the scientists are assuming we do by taking the 32% of times that it proved anthropogenic climate change as fact, when majority of the time there is no conclusion to be made. Therefore, 97% of climate scientists, are, in fact, acting unscientifically in this case. Reiterating previous debate points In a previous debate with the same user, it was established that 3.225% of all CO2 emissions are caused from humans by unnatural causes. [4] In addition, the global temperature for over the past 136 years has only gone up by about 1 degree fahrenheit[1]. These two facts suggest that if humans have had impact on the climate, it is hardly anything to be worried about at all. Problems with CO2 emissions claims Since there may be an increase in natural CO2 emissions, it is hard to conclude that the CO2 emissions by humans is what is causing the warming specifically. All variables need to be taken into account, which the study in my second paragraph under “Acknowledging opposing evidence” that claims anthropogenic climate change happens from CO2 emissions by humans, doesn’t take into account the natural CO2 emissions, the activity of the sun, or anything else that could be leading to warming of the earth. In addition, it has been found in one study by Willie Soon et al, that CO2 emissions rising often follows temperature rise, and not always the other way around [5]. If it was as simple as CO2 rises, and therefore temperature rises due to it, then the reverse should not be happening where temperature rises and then CO2 rises. It was also found that CO2 forcing effects on seasonal temperature to be inconclusive, particularly since CO2 emissions cause warming at first, but the warming causes more evaporation of water and thus more clouds and humidity, which lead to a cooling effect, the net effect is not much change in the overall temperature [5] Next, another study performed by G. V Chilingar et al found that “Even significant releases of the anthropogenic carbon dioxide into the atmosphere do not change average parameters of the Earth’s heat regime and the atmospheric greenhouse effect. Moreover, CO2 concentration increase in the atmosphere results in rising agricultural productivity and improves the conditions for reforestation. Thus, accumulation of small additional amounts of carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere as a result of anthropogenic activities has practically no effect on the Earth’s climate.” In another comprehensive study on global temperature rises by Patrick J. Michaels et al, it was concluded from “observations of atmospheric CO2 buildup and global CO2 emissions... that lead to exponential warming... is not based upon the reality of recent decades.” Many of the models scientists have come out with to show that CO2 rises cause exponential warming, are not reflective of what has actually been happening in the world, and the warming in the world is much more linear. Problems in general with anthropogenic climate change While I could continue to talk about all of the evidence against anthropogenic climate change, I shall instead provide a link to over 90 peer-reviewed scientific articles that show problems with anthropogenic climate change; there are many and various problems with it ranging from how CO2 doesn’t actually affect temperature in the long-term since it balances out when water is evaporated by the initial warming, to problems with climate models, to what should have been expected to result from anthropogenic climate change not actually happening. [7] Due to all of these issues listed above in this category and the previous 3, it is difficult to believe the climate scientists who claim anthropogenic climate change is a reality, when, as far as I’m aware, they have not addressed the above issues outlined. Inconclusive results and the default position Because as mentioned before, that majority of the studies done into anthropogenic climate change resulted in inconclusive or neutral results, the default position should be that anthropogenic climate change does not exist. Just as believing a god doesn’t exist is the default position when there is not conclusive evidence for or against a god, or majority of the evidence is inconclusive or neutral, so would then the position on anthropogenic climate change have the default position of not believing in it.

climate change,"Round four defense ""The first most obvious mistake my opponent made in their argument was a cherry-picking fallacy. A cherry-picking fallacy is defined as ""When only select evidence is presented in order to persuade the audience to accept a position, and evidence that would go against the position is withheld. The stronger the withheld evidence, the more fallacious the argument."" [8] As you can see, my opponent, in round 2, only offered evidence which suggests anthropogenic climate change is real, and did not offer any evidence that suggests climate change is due to some other reason. "" Capitalistslave First, there would have to be counter evidence to withhold. I do not perceive that I withheld any evidence, any my opponent has not shown any counter evidence. My opponent has failed to meet his/her burden of proof by showing that there is evidence to withhold. Second, if any evidence is withheld it is weak, thus the fallacious of the argument is small. Third, there is the fallacy fallacy. ""Form: Argument A for the conclusion C is fallacious. Therefore, C is false. Exposition: Like anything else, the concept of logical fallacy can be misunderstood and misused, and can even become a source of fallacious reasoning. To say that an argument is fallacious is, among other things, to claim that there is not a sufficiently strong logical connection between the premisses and the conclusion. This says nothing about the truth or falsity of the conclusion, so it is unwarranted to conclude that it's false simply because some argument for it is fallacious. "" [15] Even if I did withhold strong evidence, it doesn't mean Anthropogenic climate change is false, all it means is my argument is fallacious. ""A scientific consensus exists on the reality of anthropogenic climate change. -Stupidape This argument is fallacious because it doesn't take into account direct evidence, and only is about the opinions of climate scientists, who are not infallible. I already pointed this out in my main arguments, but that wasn't meant to be a direct response to my opponent, but a rebuttal on the general claim. In addition, there is room for doubt as long as there is not 100% of climate scientists who agree on this matter, which is not the case."" Capitalistslave True, climate change scientists are not infallible, but considering the scientific scholarly peer reviewed sources, the percentage of climate change scientist who support versus opposing man-made climate change, and the burden of proof is to be shared equally, I have more than met my burden of proof for showing the existence of man-made climate change. An alternative explanation is the USA court system. We do not require 100% proof to convict someone, instead we require a reasonable doubt in criminal cases, and preponderance of the evidence in civil. I have shown in my round two argument that we can believe beyond a reasonable doubt that man-made climate change exists. Finally, considering the scope of the entire world and global climate change, any direct evidence can be considered non-sequitur because it would add too little to support the claim. I would literally have to type 30,000 some characters to provide enough direct evidence to prove anthropgenic climate change. """"Man-made climate change has already claimed human lives and continues to do so..."" -Stupidape This appears to be a Non Sequitur fallacy. This is ""when the conclusion does not follow from the premises. In more informal reasoning, it can be when what is presented as evidence or reason is irrelevant or adds very little to support to the conclusion."" [9] The amount of deaths happened from a heat wave in France. Sudden hot weather in one country doesn't prove that there is global climate change, let alone that it is anthropogenic."" Capitalistslave The evidence may add very little and could qualify as non-sequitur. Yet, remember the fallacy fallacy. [15] More importantly, the scope of the entire planet is very large, so practically any argument I make giving specific examples could qualify as the last part of the non-sequitur fallacy. ""adds very little to support to the conclusion."" For example, the glaciers melting are just one small part of the entire world's ecosystem. Therefore, this could be considered a non-sequitur fallacy. Yet, evidence is cumulative. Individually the glaciers melting and the heatwaves might be non-sequitur, but together with a several more events and these would be significant enough to no longer qualify as non-sequitur and instead be a fully functional argument. Think of a bunch of straws in a haystack. Each straw could be considered non-sequitur taken individually, yet enough straws form a haystack. A person wouldn't dismiss the entire haystack as non-sequitur just because each individual straw adds little evidence for the conclusion, the existence of a haystack. Just as a person shouldn't dismiss small evidence that supports the conclusion, as long as there enough other straws to make a full argument. Now if my entire argument was just the heat waves, yes this would be non-sequitur, but considering the other evidence available that accumulates with the heat-waves, the heat waves cannot be dismissed. ""In addition, the heat-related deaths in the United States since 2000 has been going down[10], which is odd if supposedly there is significant amounts of warming. But yes, if you look at the graph provided by the EPA there, each of the three spikes in deaths, one in 2000, one soon after 2005, and one soon after 2010, are each going down over time. If you were to draw a straight line representing the average, it would also be going down. "" Captalistslave There is many alternative explanations for this. One is that awareness of global climate change has increased, and thus governments and their people are more prepared to deal with such events. Another, is that technology has increased and therefore weather stations are better able to warn residents of the danger. ""This is still a non sequitur for the same reasons I said before for the other one. Claiming deaths are a result from anthropogenic climate change doesn't prove anthropogenic climate change is occuring. "" Captalistslave If I wanted to prove that an invisible gas like carbon monoxide existed, showing the amount of people that died from carbon monoxide annually would be an effective method. As humans we do not take lightly the deaths of our fellow human beings. People want explanations. I contend that showing that 150,000 people die annually from man-made global climate change is an excellent indicator of whether or not anthropogenic climate change exists or not. My opponent seems to have divided my argument into two charactories. Indirect evidence and direct small non-sequitor evidence. Dismissing the indirect evidence for not being direct, the 97% consensus, and the direct evidence for being too insignificant to prove man-made climate change. The direct and indirect evidence for anthropgenic climate change is massive. Just because, I did not directly show this massive evidence, does not mean I was incorrect. I decided it was best to give a brief argument from high quality sources. Knowing that the information is avaliable and nobody wants to read an extremely long debate.

I also do not claim to know everything about feminism. I will use sources from the internet as well as books to support my argument. First, we must define Feminism. There are many different types of feminism. For example: Antiporn feminism, Cultural Feminism, Hip Hop feminism, Lesbian Feminism, Queer feminism, and Radical feminism. The feminism it seems you disagree with is the one that is prevalent in the Pink Hat movement. But my stance will be from the Antiporn and Cultural Feminist movements. These movements advocate the reality: Women are more nurturing, cooperative, and communicative. Instead of measuring themselves against men, women should make their own activities more visible and valued.

feminism,"You claim that feminism encourages false rape accusations and stereotyping men as bad. Um... No, that's not what feminism is at all. Feminism is the doctrine advocating social, political, and all other rights of women equal to those of men[1]"". Now, you admit that this is something you are for, so I guess you have problems with how feminists go about this? Really, I think your entire argument stems from a complete misunderstanding of the movement. So, what is feminism? This is a difficult question because, much like religion, feminism is different for each feminist. The mission statement of the movement is equal rights between the sexes, which you agree is good. By this definition, you are a feminist. If you could indicate how you aren't a feminist, that'd be appreciated. Maybe you disagree that there is a systematic discrimination against women, the patriarchy. Is there a patriarchy? Well, as it commonly seems to be the case, I must define ""the patriarchy"". Basically, it means a system where men are valued over women[2]. This can be shown in the wage gap[3], rape culture[4] (though men can be victims of rape, rape culture usually targets women), and gender roles[5]. Rebuttals: What you are saying here is very dangerous. Stating that feminism promotes false rape accusations is an example of rape culture. 60% of victims report abuse, and 97% of abusers will not see jail[6]. Only 1.5-8% of rape reports are fake[7], so Puh-LEASE do not try and say that considerable amount of rape reports are fake and that we should cast doubt on those few that come forward. If we are going of the definition of feminism I stated earlier, then feminists aren't trying to put men as stereotypically bad. We are trying to make men and women equal. If you think that trying to remove the bias towards men is trying to say they are bad, then I am going to have to ask you go to timeout because that idea is downright childish. In the end there you say something about ""calling the police about something ridiculous is obscure"". I think you mean absurd, but if you didn't then I'm not sure what that would mean. If it is obscure, then false rape accusations don't happen often and thus shouldn't be a problem. If you meant absurd, then I would agree that false rape accusations are deplorable, but again I would say that ""false rape reports"" is not a tenant of feminism nor is it a likely to occur.",PRO,"You claim that feminism encourages false rape accusations and stereotyping men as bad.

feminism,"As per the rules of the debate as set by my opponent, this will be my final argument. Since my opponent has failed to formulate a response, I see little need to elaborate much on my previous post. I will merely offer a brief summary of my arguments and this debate as a whole. My opponent claims that feminism is an incorrect argument. While I don't consider feminism an argument, I accepted the debate under these terms so I will argue as such. My opponent has offered nothing but an unsupported opinion regarding what he believes is feminism; a term of which he seems to lack a full understanding. There were no parameters set for this debate in terms of a place in which we were arguing, yet my opponent seems to have focused his argument purely on feminism in the United States. In fact, he basically concedes the debate by stating ""in 1st world countries such as the USA, there should be no such thing as a feminist. The same can not be said for 3rd world countries, where women rights have not been established and women often have to be near a man to go anywhere in the city."" Had we focused this debate on USA or first world countries alone, that statement would not be considered a concession, but the fact that we did not specify those terms shows that my opponent agrees that feminism is at least necessary in some places. Now let's ignore the fact that Con conceded the debate already and pretend we were just addressing first world countries. Con offers no sources to show that equality now fully exists, nor does he provide and decent explanation as to why feminism should disappear once success has been found. The fact of the matter is, inequality between the sexes still exists, as I showed in my previous round, and even once equality is reached here, feminism will still be important to help maintain that equality and to help spread the ideology throughout the countries where help is needed. Finally, if my arguments and sources are not enough to convince the reader, the fact that Con has only provided one poorly written paragraph backed by no sources, merely opinions, followed by a forfeited round, should be enough to win me this debate.

I think feminism was the belief that men and women should be equal, but I proved that this is no longer the case in third wave feminism.

My opponent has implied that it is the fault of men today that women weren't allowed to vote in some states until 1919. It was wrong that this happened, but taking revenge on men won't solve anything. In fact, it will cause embitterment between both sexes. Your first argument is invalid, because I never said that men and women weren't intellectually equal (although they generally don't have as much physical strength as men do, which I will provide the proof for below).

feminism,"Hi everyone I'm Ilan and I am not a feminist. Immediately alarm bells may be ringing in your mind that maybe this guy is a ""sexist"" or ""a rape apologist"" or anything of the such so just to clarify I am none of these things. I firmly believe that in the idea that everyone should be equal no if ands and or buts. And now you might be thinking why is this guy not a feminist then? Well, the answer to that question is that feminism does not have a monopoly on equality; if you believe in equality you are not automatically a feminist as many feminists like to state. I am in fact an egalitarian. The difference between the two is that feminism is merely about getting equality for women whereas egalitarianism is equality for absolutely everybody. The dictionary definition of egalitarian is ""believing in or based on the principle that all people are equal and deserve equal rights and opportunities."" and that for feminism is ""the advocacy of women's rights on the ground of the equality of the sexes."". Now that we have established some ground I can really start to get into why I am not a feminist. First of all, I am a man. And I am not trying to say that men cannot be feminists, be whatever the hell that you want, but as a man, I feel that I should campaign for my sex and as we have already established feminism is not about gaining equality for all but helping just Women to achieve equality. Even feminists that say that men and other groups are included in feminist issues still do not really campaign for our problems. One major issue that men face is prostate cancer. Prostate cancer kills just as many people as breast cancer does but receives merely half the funding towards research and cures. I have never in my life met a feminist that has agreed with the statement ""Prostate cancer is a feminist issue"" because quite frankly it is not.

abortion,"Thank you to both the audience and my opponent for yet another debate on abortion. The resolution is simply ""Abortion"" and my opponent has stated that he supports the affirmative. I shall then argue against that case. To begin, I submit the definition of Abortion by Medicine.net Medical Dictionary: Abortion: In medicine, an abortion is the premature exit of the products of conception (the fetus, fetal membranes, and placenta) from the uterus. It is the loss of a pregnancy and does not refer to why that pregnancy was lost. http://www.medterms.com...

Since my opponent has used his first round to merely ask for my opening statement and did not clarify the resolution or offer any sort of framing, I will assume that my opponent is trying to affirm ""abortion"" in general. I start by arguing that there are many forms of abortion that should be prevented on moral grounds. 1. Partial Birth Abortions In which the fetus, nearly fully formed, is destroyed during induced labor. At this point in time, the mother might as well wait until full term and give it up for adoption as the already blurry line of morality in abortion becomes even blurrier. 2. Spontaneous Abortions In which a woman with an implanted fetus loses the fetus accidentally, commonly known as a miscarriage. This should be avoided because for the most part, women who miscarry actually wanted the child. 3. Abortions inflicted on unwilling people There is something inherently immoral in the act of walking up to a pregnant woman and kicking in her stomach such that she miscarries. Though this is a form of abortion, I argue that it should in no way be supported. 4. Dangerous abortions I am against many forms of abortion for health reasons. The use of coat hangers to stimulate an abortion, for example. Or throwing oneself off a flight of stairs. Or going to a back-alley abortionist that doubles as a tattoo parlor. These are all very dangerous ways of abortion. I look forward to my opponent's rebuttal. Thank you.",CON,"I shall then argue against that case. ...

By the 22 century, the population estimated to be 11.2 billion people and if abortion were illegal, the population would be so much higher. If our country stops the use of abortion, we will end like china, forcing women that don't want to have an abortion to have an abortion to control the population. When women are forced to get abortions, a lot of women commit suicide. Women have a higher rate of suicide in China because of this reason and in almost every other country, men have a higher rate of suicide.

abortion,"First of all, I put my sources in the Comments section right after I posted arguments since I absolutely forgot to put them in my case. I also gave the Bibliography because I did use books. So let me tell you why I wasn't able to make it those rounds. Give my opponent a conduct point for me forfeiting a rounds. The story is I went to a sleepover and some very unfortunate things happened to me. Anyways, I'll try to give a reply. Please excuse my forfeit and I ask my audience to base their focus on arguments instead of conduct. 1. An abortion is a fundamental right for a woman. I think you misunderstand what I meant. I didn't mean that the part about Roe vs. Wade confirming it correct was my argument. I just meant to confirm that it is legally a human right. This was my actual argument: ""A woman has the right of an abortion because it her body. Her body is her right. An embyro and/or fetus in a body is technically still her property. She can do what she wants with her property."" Being pregnant means that the embyro/fetus is in your body which means it is your property. Thus an abortion is a fundamental right for a woman because it is her property. 2. Abortions reduce injury and death. I meant that without legalizing abortion, there will be homemade abortion which would hurt more people. With legalized abortion, there are less deaths for the person having the abortion and there are less injury with abortion legalized. I don't get how doing something illegal is that person's problem. If someone came out and got his machine gun to kill a bunch of people, would it ""be your problem""? Just like murder, abortion hurts others. 3. Abortion stances are usually religious. A pro-life stance based on religion should not be upheld in our laws due to the violation of church and state separation. Since the majority of abortion stances are based on religion, abortion should not be legalized based on someone's religious beliefs. They can believe that abortion is murder, they just can't legalize abortion based on their religious beliefs. Um, the government in the Separation of Church and State states religion isn't the basis of our laws. 4. Modern abortion procedures are safe. 1st, the safety of abortion provides an alternative to homemade abortions which cause less safety for the mothers. 2nd of all, all my sources are in the Comments section. 3rd of all, you're math is bad. Let's say how many deaths are in 1 billion people? 133,000! That's a lot of women dying. How about our safe medical procedures? 10,000 deaths. Our safe medical procedure just saved 123,000 lives which help much more. 0.13% for unsafe homemade procedures with 0.00001% for safe mechanical procedures. Thus, legal abortion saves lives. 5. Abortion gives option. No, it's better for the parent to decide if they are able to take care of a mentally deficient child. Giving option is better than forcing someone to make the decision. It's not about the right to sentence someone to life, it's about the parents' freedom to. We are arguing about the freedom that parents have when they have no money to get machines and features. 6. Abortion reduces crime. Many of the ""criminals"" are doing their action to get food for their children when they have no economic capability. That's why they do crimes. The choice to have an abortion means they can reach economic stability. 7. A baby should not come into this world unwanted. You still never explained why a baby should come into this world unwanted. Rebuttal: 8. Abortion is murder. Fetuses are not biologically proven to be humans. Until they are, the removing or expelling of an embyro or fetus is not human. They are not humans because it has not been proven that they have a personality or a character. Thus it is not murder. 9. There are options. I have 3 points which will destroy our entire contention. 1st of all, an embyro/fetus is not a human. 2nd of all, there are many alternatives to abortion but their is still abortion as an option. 3rd of all, taking away the option of abortion is just like banning adoption and one of the alternatives. Thus, abortion is one of those abortions. 10. What if you were aborted? If I were aborted, I wouldn't have known I existed. This is irrelevant. 11. The mother should not be in control of the baby's life. 1st of all, it's not a baby. It's not a child. It's an embyro or fetus. Thus, it's the woman's property. The fetus or embyro is not a child. It is the property of the mother. Thus, the the mother has the control of her own property. 12. Late term abortion. We are not arguing about late term abortion. We are arguing about abortion. 13. I don't get what your point is. Where are your sources? Sorry for not producing good arguments.

abortion,"I thank my opponent for his response to my previous statement. ""Whether or not abortion can also be classified as assault is irrelevant to this debate"" (I argue this statement) As a matter of fact it is relevant to this debate. The topic we are discussing is abortion and whether it should be accepted or not. Clearly anyone who is kicked in the stomach has witnessed an act of assault. Abortion is only abortion if it is considered to be or not to be by the child carrier. If not considered abortion, it is only a mere act of assault. This can happen to anyone. I now argue my opponent's ideology of the ""morning after pill"". Referring back to my opponent's definition of abortion, the morning after pill is also another form of abortion. It all eliminates the infant correct? Therefore, my opponent provided another form of abortion that he stated is the solution to pregnancy even though he is supposed to argue against it. Any act of the mother eliminating her child would be classified as abortion only if it is intended by the carrier. Immorality: No, I was not intending it to fall under my opponent's four categories. I was only preventing that from being argued. It may not be relevant to the four types of abortion, but it is relevant to the topic at hand. what is right and wrong?: The people in this world have their own basic concept of what is right or wrong. This can also relate to morality. Every single person shares the same individual mindset, their own gathered ideas and opinions of what is right and wrong. I extend my argument referring to morality with only the slightest question...What is moral in this world? Certainly not shaving. This refers to the Bible. It is absolutely hypocritical for someone who shaves to say abortion is immoral. In addition to my opponent's remark about whether kicking a woman in the stomach is moral or not. Assault is not moral. But then again we are not talking about assault, we are talking about abortion. Why I did not respond to the other three categories of abortion, well that is the thing....I actually did in a general remark. Referring to my previous statements about morality, intentional abortion and teen pregnancy. I extend my previous arguments..... In conclusion, I affirm abortion as a way of preventing further difficulty in life with both the mother and child. Creating problems or preventing them with out the slightest sense of guilt.

abortion,"""This is a tough point to make on your end. There are serious differences between countries that you are ignoring that would contribute to the differences in abortion practices like culture, Societal feelings, Access to healthcare/contraceptives, Education, To name a few. "" Almost half of the 56million abortions in the world each year are unsafe and generally illegal. As a result, At least 22, 800women die every year and 7 million are admitted to hospitals with complications. About 8%of maternal mortality is due to unsafe abortion. Abortion laws are not only harmful to women""s health, They are generally unworkable or onerous. Even seemingly minor restrictions violate the rights of pregnant people, Interfere with medical discretion, And compromise the quality of care. Since the laws were not written with women""s health in mind, Healthcare professionals are often put in the position of skirting the law in order to do their jobs of saving peoples' lives and health. The sheer range and inconsistency of abortion laws around the world proves they are unrelated to good healthcare, And are politically motivated. This helps explain why developed countries like Canada enjoy very low maternal mortality rates from abortion, While the most obscenely high mortality rates occur in African countries where abortion is totally banned. Of course, Healthcare services are usually superior and more accessible in developed countries, But it's clear that anti-abortion laws kill women, While repealing the laws saves their lives. Having no abortion restrictions also helps to integrate abortion care into the healthcare system, Facilitate early access, And improve women""s health in general. The nature of the fetus and its moral status is EXACTLY the point. The moral value of a fetus is a matter of personal opinion? I disagree. Well that's your opinion and the point is, ""should abortion be illegal"" Taking away one person's right for an other is morally wrong. So just because it's law and has been ""firmly established"" for years doesn't make it right. It does not make it right, It makes it legal. The very point of the argument. . . Which facts have I confused exactly? The fact that laws do not reduce abortion. A comprehensive sex education, Readily available access to free birth control and a free and comprehensive support and health care system. America offers little and always at a cost, Punishing the poorest and the weakest shunning and shaming single teens mothers, Charging 30k for deliveries. It""s ironic that abortion laws are designed to limit abortions, Yet one of the best ways to reduce abortion is to liberalize or repeal anti-abortion laws. That""s not the only factor of course. The real key is to promote women""s rights, With particular attention to their reproductive rights. Most abortions occur because people can""t afford to have a child, So governments can significantly reduce abortion numbers by building a more stable, Prosperous society and making child-rearing economically feasible. There is no need for societies to defend fetal interests directly, As the best way to protect fetuses is to provide resources directly to pregnant people. When a pregnant woman is safe and healthy, So is her fetus. The abortion debate will probably never be resolved on a philosophical level, Because the anti-choice movement is strongly motivated by religious ideology. Their fixation on the fetus, With their foregone conclusion that fetuses are full human beings with rights, Cancels out any competing claim for women""s rights. Underlying all the pro-fetus rhetoric is the unquestioned assumption that women were made to have babies, This is their God-given natural role, And the law must enforce that. A logical extension of this view is that any woman who has an abortion must be a victim of coercion, Or too ignorant or desperate to understand what she""s doing. Since abortion is assumed to be bad for women, They must be ""protected"" from abortion by criminalizing it.",PRO,"There are serious differences between countries that you are ignoring that would contribute to the differences in abortion practices like culture, Societal feelings, Access to healthcare/contraceptives, Education, To name a",148,"['0.00500394799746573', '0.9949960470199585']",0.00500394799746573,0.9949960470199585

trump,"First of all, I support O'Malley, but that isn't important. It looks like this debate comes down to Trump's stance on immigration.

I'm not very tolerant of plagiarism, and I am certain that it's against the rules of the website, but for the purpose of the debate, I will continue debating. However, if pro continuously plagarizes entire articles, I may make the decision to stop debating, seeing as I'll only be debating against writers of various articles, rather than Pro. Outline I. Trump's ""Successful"" Businesses II. Trump on Climate Change III. The ""Trump Effect"" IV. Sources I. Trump's ""Successful"" Businesses Any successful businessman can run into trouble from time-to-time, whether it's making a mistake that may hurt his investments, or having suits filed against him. Trump is regarded as one of the most successful businessmen in America. However, his history of businesses and the source of his wealth, only prove that he is incapable of running his own businesses. In fact, an article from ""Business Insider,"" claims that the New York Times analyzed 61 of Trump's projects and deals from the 2000s to 2012. The researchers and analysists found that around 40 of those deals were either failures or had problems which deemed them as fruitless, while only a mere 21 of them were successes. That means that approximately 66% of his deals were unsuccessful (S1). The Business Insider article continues by providing the list of which projects were immediate failures, which ones had problems, and which were successful. His shortcomings in business are also apparent in the 3,500 suits filed against him, ranging from skirmishes with his casino patrons to lawsuits regarding multi-million dollar real estate deals (S2). ""Call it the art of the bad deal, one created by the arrogance and recklessness of a businessman whose main talent is self-promotion."" -Kurt Eichenwald Many people, including myself, believe that Trump's ""success"" was a result of family ties, especially his father's lucrative real-estate business, and his shameless self-promotion, such as that controversy with his ""small hands"" where Trump responded to an article saying he has ""big hands,"" with a gold pen.Kurt Eichenwald, writer of the News Week Article, ""Trump's Many Business Failures, Explained,"" expands upon this idea that ""Trump boasted when he announced his candidacy last year that he had made his money “the old-fashioned way,” but he is no Bill Gates or Michael Bloomberg, self-made billionaires who were mavericks, innovators in their fields. Instead, the Republican nominee’s wealth is Daddy-made. Almost all of his best-known successes are attributable to family ties or money given to him by his father,"" (S3). Donald Trump has tried to run his businesses apart from real estate, though to no avail. Trump, owner of the line of ""Trump Casinos,"" has amassed four bankruptcies. He claims that he had ""nothing to do"" with the failure of the business, despite owning 28% of the stock in the companies. He has also pitched some other business ideas that he put into action. Like his casinos, these ideas failed, terribly. Trump Airlines was a private luxury airline company started in 1988. Due to the lack of profits, the company closed in 1992. Trump also unleashed a brand of his own vodka and steaks called ""Trump Vodka,"" and ""Trump Steaks."" Trump Vodka was made in 2006. The company stopped production in 2011 due to a lack of profit and interest. Trump Steaks began in 2007 but closed down in 2012 for over 51 health code violations, including serving five-month-old duck. That's some ""Trump-quality"" cuisine! Trump attributes the health violations his managers for ""lazily hiring terrible cooks."" The list of Trump's business failures goes on, with things such as Trump the Game, Trump Magazines, Trump University, Trump Mortgage, GoTrump.com, Trump International Tower of Chicago, etc (S4). His inability to manage his own businesses not only proves that he is incapable of administrating his own businesses, he is incapable of building a business empire, he has a lack in priorities for his business affairs, and when all else fails, he searches for a scapegoat. II. Trump on Climate Change Pro claims that Trump will be ""saving billions"" by cutting Environmental Protection, and while that's all well and good for taxpayers, we will still allow climate change to threaten our world. Not only that, but Rex Tillerson, Trump's appointed cabinet member as the Secretary of State, has the authority to remove environmental regulations on businesses, allowing them to dispose of their wastes improperly, contaminating drinking water, killing life in nature and adding to our immense pollution. And the likelihood of Tillerson doing so is high since he is associated with ExxonMobil, a company that provides gas and oil. Cutting environmental regulations on ExxonMobil will mean that they can dump their wastes anywhere. Additionally, if we neglect the environment, then we will run into more health concerns. If water is polluted, then cities, and maybe even states, may have to pay to get clean water. With the threat of global warming, our water supply may be greatly decreased because of the lesser amount of snow pack. And if the air is polluted, then we will need to pay immense amounts to clear the air, though there is not much that can do so. We will run into more health concerns by ignoring the environment, and we may have to pay a large amount for reparations and to buy purified water, which may accumulate for more than the government spending to protect the environment. III. The ""Trump Effect"" Trump's words to not highlight concerns of ""equality"" or ""tolerance."" His talk of banning Muslims from entering the country, and the provocation of violence do not make him the type of person capable of inspiring and bringing America together. I'm certain that no rational person wants to hear their president saying ""‘[Mexicans] are rapists. And some, I assume, are good people,"" or ""I will bomb the s*** out of them!"" (S5). America should have a confident president who can inspire the masses, and point America in the right direction, not an egostatic man who talks of himself so highly, that people are not sure if he's running for President, or for the Guiness World Record for the man with the highest ego in America. The ""Trump Effect"" is the belief that Trump's campaign is making an impression on juviniles and inspiring closeted bigots to unite and fight for their racist beliefs. In a document written by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), the SPLC claims that ""[Trump] is producing an alarming level of fear and anxiety among children of color and inflaming racial and ethnic tensions in the classroom. Many students worry about being deported. Other students have been emboldened by the divisive, often juvenile rhetoric in the campaign. Teachers have noted an increase in bullying, harassment and intimidation of students whose races, religions or nationalities have been the verbal targets of candidates on the campaign trail."" In fact, mroe than two thirds of teacher reported that students, mainly immigrants and Muslims, have expressed concerns about what might happen to their families if Trump is elected president. More than one thirds of teachers reported that they observed an increse in anti-Muslim or anti-immigrant sentiment. A teacher from a middle school with a large population of African-American Muslims said “My students are terrified of Donald Trump. They think that if he’s elected, all black people will get sent back to Africa,” (S6). Donald Trump's campaign and public harassment is clearly making an impact on the populus in the worst ways possible, promoting bigotry and violence and bullying. He, through his words, clearly shows that he is incapable of being a president who can unite the masses. IV. Sources S1) http://www.businessinsider.com... S2) http://www.usatoday.com...

trump,"I'll be honest, that was an interesting video, however, I still like him. Here's what I got from the video: 1. He's changed his opinion on multiple issues. I don't see anything wrong with that, if anything, I think he was smart to become a Republican in recent years. Look, times change meaning that a policy that would have worked years ago might not work today and a party that may have appeared favorable once may not appear as favorable now. In 2000, when Trump ran for president under the Reform Party, he believed in universal healthcare as an option. The idea that he maintains that belief, despite what the video said, is ridiculous. In early 2015, he brought up the idea that the government should start making deals with hospitals to help low income Americans. Later, a spokesperson (not Trump himself) stated that Trump would be open to a universal / market-based system that would open up a variety of choices. Today, his official healthcare plan affirms that he supports a 100% free market system, where insurance companies must compete nationwide - the exact opposite of universal healthcare. 2. He's donated to and supported the Bill and Hillary in the past. That makes Trump living proof that we have corrupt politicians in Washington; in fact, that's what brought down primary rivals like Sen. Rand Paul (who accepted money from Trump). The video starts going into conspiracy theory-mode; it theorizes that because Trump donated to them, he secretly supports them and is part of an elaborate plot to make Hillary our next president. First of all, there's no evidence. Second of all, if donating money means working for someone, wouldn't Trump also be working for Rand Paul? And wouldn't he have refrained from calling out Hillary for accepting his donation? 3. He's not extremely religious. I'm okay with that. He said that he does not ask God for forgiveness, and then the video pulls up Bible quote after Bible quote - but who really follows every word of the Bible? If you did, you'd be a criminal; the Bible says that we should stone our children if they are disobedient - which is considered murder, and murder is a crime. The video is basically anti-Trump propaganda with little to no factual information. SOURCES: http://www.politifact.com...-/ https://www.donaldjtrump.com...

trump,"As you so kindly asked, I will tell you most of the times Trump has been racist, In the year 1992, Trump's casinos transferred black dealers off certain tables to please racist dealers. They were fined $200, 000. In 2004, Trump fired a black contestant from, ""The Apprentice"" for being ""over-educated"". In 2015, Trump called immigrants who were Mexicans, ""rapists"" who are, ""bringing crime and drugs"" to the United States of America. Listen, I get it, ""Immigration is illegal"", Trust me I've heard it one too many times. THEY'RE STILL HUMANS. They deserve a chance at a better life. Obama was making a difference for immigrants. Then Trump came and just discarded all of Obama's hard work. In 2010, Trump agreed to segregate Muslims in lower Manhattan. In 2016, During his campaign, Trump constantly retweeted tweets from neo-nazis and white supremacists. Which, In your argument, You stated he condemned. In 2019, Trump tweeted that four colored congresswomen should go back to where they come from. In 2015, Trump wanted a, ""ban on all Muslims entering the U. S. "" Trump is extremely misogynistic. In September 2015, Trump made a statement about Clary Fiorina, Which stated, ""Can you imagine that the face of our next president. . . She's a woman. . . "" In April 2015, Trump made a very offensive statement about Hilary Clinton which stated, ""If Hilary Clinton can't satisfy her husband, What makes her think she can satisfy America? "" In August 2012, Trump said about Arianna Huffington, ""Unattractive inside and out. I fully understand why her former husband left her for a man --- he made a good decision. "" In October 2007, He made extremely bold claims saying, ""I do own Miss Universe. I do own Miss USA. "" That's extremely ignorant because men don't ""own"" women. We are free and we are independent. Trump is a pathetic excuse for a man. Trump has been accused of sexual assault many times. Well, Over twenty-five times. The information has been released of his sexual assault and rape against minors which is disturbing. Since you want proof. . . ""Michael Parker, 10-years old, Oral rape, Mar-a-Lago, Palm Beach, FL, 1992. Trump paid his parents a $3 million settlement"" to keep quiet. I'll state a few more. ""Maria Olivera, 12-years old. Her family was paid $16 million to settle allegations of forcible intercourse occurring in Mar-a-Lago, Palm Beach, FL, 1993. "" He PAID off families to keep quiet about their children getting raped. It's sickening. I feel ill just thinking about it. Last one, ""Rebecca Conway, 13-years old, Intercourse and oral sex, Trump Vineyard Estates, Charlottesville, VA, 2012, 5 million dollar settlement. "" This information isn't very popular because Trump has kept it from reaching news channels and big social media platforms until now. That information was discovered by investigative-journalist in D. C. Whose name was not provided. The subjects are still under investigation by the Department of Justice. Trump and his lawyer, Michael Cohen, Who helped him, ""fix"" things and pay off the families are being investigated for these crimes. There are accusations that Trump allegedly sexually assaulted many women he worked with and they spoke out about it. Of course, Trump denied every single claim of him sexually assaulting anyone, Despite the evidence. Abolishing the second amendment would not be horrible. It would make America a much safer place for everyone in it. Proven by England. England banned guns in all households, It is illegal in England to possess a firearm. After the Dunblane massacre, England abolished guns and since then, Gun violence is extremely rare in the U. K. Gun violence in the U. S. Has taken so many lives and it needs to go. There are many other ways to protect yourself, Guns are deadly. You want to talk about bills? How about the ones he REVOKED? Here's one, ""Trump reversed an interpretation of the Civil Rights Act that protected transgender workers. "" HE created an unsafe environment for the LGBTQ+ community. He, ""Reversed a ban on civil forfeiture"" Which is unconstitutional because it takes away our 4th amendment rights. Yes, Trump has done many things that have not helped our environment in any way. He blocked the Clean Power Plan which Obama has put in place to focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. The administration reported that they would revoke it entirely. He reversed a rule that Obama had made for a ban on drilling for oil in the Arctic. Whi9ch Obama had put in place to benefit our environment, Which he truly cared about. Reversed a ban on plastic bottles at national parks. Plastic is a main reason why our planet is dying. That ban was put in place to help the environment. He repealed a ban on lead bullets which Obama put in place because the poison in the bullet could harm wildlife. Canceled the order that limited how many sea animals could be trapped or killed in fishing nets. That order could've seriously increased the marine life numbers. He repealed a rule that banned dumping waste from mining into streams. Marine pollution is a HUGE problem. If the ocean dies, The human race will become extinct. He repealed a rule allowing transgenders to serve in the military. That is very discriminatory and goes against our 14th amendment rights! Now you cannot tell me that when Trump repealed that rule, He was in the right. He repealed 72 documents explaining the rights of disabled students in education. He revoked federal protections of transgender students in American education. He began the process of undoing the Johnson Amendment. Which you should already know what that is, So I shouldn't have to explain it. I gave several facts about how Trump has harmed this country in so many ways.

trump,"Trump has only caused chaos for this country and hasn't made a significant impact that was good. His campaigns in 2016 claimed that, ""He would make America great again"" Our citizens trusted his statement but he lied and took advantage of our trust. Many Americans had made the mistake of voting for him and many have vowed to not vote for him again. I believe Biden has the upper hand in this election, I believe if Biden wins, He will make this country better than Trump claimed he would. Biden has claimed he would help fix climate change, Which has been an ongoing, Environment threatening problem. That Trump has done NOTHING about. Global warming is one of the biggest threats to not just our country, BUT THE WHOLE WORLD. Yet, Our president could care less. Also, When Trump was elected, He had very little political history which should've been a sign that he knew nothing about government. It's almost like citizens voted blindly. Many accusations had been made that Trump was bribing people to vote for him. To be completely and utterly honest, I completely believe that Trump would make such an irrational decision like that. He's ignorant. He is also racist. Back in 2018 I believe, He made many racist comments about Hispanics and yes he did receive extreme backlash but that should be a CLEAR sign to people from everywhere in America that he doesn't deserve the title of ""president"" Now people who have worked hard in their political career, Like Biden, Were just tossed aside as if they hadn't worked hard. Trump grew up and built his career with daddy's money. He didn't work a single day for what he has now, Everything was basically handed to him. He has earned the right to take ""The worst president"" title from James Buchanan. He is the worst president out of the 45 presidents before him. Now that's a record to beat. It's pathetic that his impeachment didn't pass through. That decision would've saved this country a lot of havoc. He has recently ordered police to harm peaceful protesters, For George Floyd's death. Trump's lazy and poor decisions is the reason of Floyd's death. Many events have happened like Floyd's death in the past four years and Trump has done nothing about it. He instead sat there in the white house hiding. Recently, He had many peaceful protesters gathered in front of the white house tear gassed so he do a photo op. He uses his power for selfish needs, He is a selfish man. He made very misogynistic claims in the past, Which still wasn't enough for everyone to see how much of a bad man he was. He is an embarrassment to this country, He is an embarrassment to our presidency. No wonder other countries look down upon us. Receipts have been released of Trump working with Jeffery Epstein to human traffic. So not only is he misogynistic and racist. He's also a rapist.

brexit,"Anti-Brexit had the facts, Brexit had the rhetoric. Irrational fear of immigration and losing autonomy. Britain clearly needs migrants considering it's own workers don't want to work the dirty jobs such as farming so migrants need to do it for them. [1] Let's Look at the facts. Britain's Membership in the EU costs around 6.3 Billion pounds or 0.3% of britains GDP. So for the leave side to be economically superior leaving would not be able to affect the UK by more than 0.3%. But considering the UK makes 13% of it's GDP from selling commodties to the EU this seems unlikely. [2] The problem with this is that economists predict that the UK could lose up to 6% of It's GDP from leaving the EU which is much greatet than 0.3% [3] This isn't even including additional costs for tarrifs that would amount to close of the cost for eu membership after free trade deals are abolished along with eu membership. [4] Also, Britain has complete control of their immigration policy so leaving would do almost nothing when it comes to immigration policy. Not to mention that 70% of Britain's population increase came from immigration. Limiting immigration radically could have some pernicious effects.

brexit,"I am sorry for my lack of evidence. That was my mistake. Perhaps I thought that there would be a general knowledge to be able to look up the United States Constitution as well as the EU's constitution as they are well known documents. As for you saying I have conceded to this argument, I beg to differ, there is no evidence suggesting this, and is merely an assumption by my opponent. Argument 1: Economic Effects: You are right, there will be an economic downturn. That unfortunately for you was not what this debate was about, the subject of this debate is ""Passing Brexit was a mistake for the United Kingdom"", and not ""There will be an economic downturn due to the passing of Brexit"". So I believe I am in the clear to agree with you on the economics of the situation. This does not mean I agree with you that Brexit was a mistake. I clearly stated that anytime a country desires to gain freedom there will be a storm before the clear. I believe the economy will become bad before it becomes good again, the difference is that the UK will be independent once it climbs atop the economic hill and ends up on the other side, thus making it a prospective decision. According to the World Trade Organization (of which the UK is a part of), over half of the UK's trade is with other countries and not with the EU, so that is over half of their trade that will go unaltered. As for trade with the EU, the UK is a number one trade market for many countries under the EU, and for that chain to break would be devastating to both countries, so I don't really believe it will happen. For instance, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity at MIT, the UK is the 9th largest export economy in the world and is the most profitable export market for countries that are in fact in the EU. For ex: Germany. The UK alone accounts for 34% of the German surplus with the EU making the UK by far Germany's most profitable export market. That is just one example of how the EU will probably without a doubt continue on with the UK in trade markets. Argument 2: Scotland You said that ""It is reasonable to conclude that the passing of Brexit will likely lead to a literal dividing of the UK, which would undoubtedly be a mistake for the UK"". You did not back up your argument. I'd like to know why the division would be a mistake for the UK, which you did not expound on. I would like to suggest that a division of the UK could in fact be a very good thing. For one, Scotland might become independent again (like they were before the year 1707) under the European Referendum. The First Minister of Scotland Alex Salmond stated ""an independent Scotland, aided by its oil wealth, would be one of the world's richest countries"". Scotland actually would be in a good position for wealth if they became independent of the UK, and not only that, Scotland would have all the things I mentioned in my first argument that comes with independence: more freedoms, national pride, leeway for better prospects, etc. Now, Scotland also wants to rejoin the EU if they become independent (You don't need evidence for this, just look at the news right now), which wouldn't be the worst thing to happen for them. As for what happens to the UK if Scotland leaves, it will not be the end of the UK. For one thing, (and this is my opinion, nobody elses) if Scotland leaves the UK, that if anything, will give the North East a great advantage in trade--having a land border with an EU country will be excellent for trade and relations. And once again, I will state: An independent country is better than a dependent country. Conclusion: Once again, I will say that I agree with you, the UK will have the disadvantage due to Brexit....At the beginning. (I'm not saying you win this argument, don't misinterpret that, I am merely agreeing a point with you). But if you could see the benefits of becoming an independent country, then for all that is holy, why not take a chance? People are so scared of change and the implications of change, that they cower. I truly believe that the UK voters voted on Brexit because they had faith that they would come through on the otherside unscathed and rewarded. I do not believe that all UK people didn't understand what Brexit was when they voted. In fact, only millions were googling Brexit after the vote out of 64 million people.( The news likes to exaggerate things). The UK will be fine as long as they do everything correctly. Trade will come back, independence will become a flying beacon of freedom, and the UK will find its place in this world with bigger and better prospects that were never thought possible before.

brexit,"I appreciate your response, So here is my final debate round Security of the country is more important than trade. Just look at what is happening in the rest of Europe. The migrant crisis is reaching epic proportions all the way to France because the borders were open and the migrants came cross all borders unobstructed. From Italy and Turkey through the rest of open Europe through the poorer nations all heading for England the most prosperous country in the EU. A border crossing with northern and southern Ireland is also critical in keeping the IRA at bay and controlling movement of people. Open borders are a disaster for security reasons. It might be easier to cross borders for regular travelers but lets look at the Sicilian mafia, They are now free to roam all over Europe, The Russian mafia has open borders to travel to England right now and poison people with polonium. The Gypsies can roam all around Europe without obstruction. And finally the migrants from the middle east including ISIS can freely cross from Turkey to anywhere in Europe. Everybody is complaining about Brexit until the bombs go off in France and England or a 1000 women are raped in Germany over the holidays because there is no control at the border. Switzerland and Norway are not in the EU and they are doing excellent. Not everyone needs to be in a big EU boys club. Countries all separated a long time ago because people couldn't get along. Yugoslavia split into 6 countries because they couldn't get along, Who says we need to make one big Europe country? Have we not learned from the Roman empire, From the Ottoman empire. Countries are created every decade in Africa, In the past in South America. Panama did not want to be part of Columbia so they created their own country with a border. Not having borders or having open borders is a bad idea. That's like not having a fence with your neighbor. And besides why should England pay 13 billion euros to the EU, How much is Romania and Bulgaria paying? Nothing. England is a rich prosperous country, They don't need to be part of the EU clan that is suffering from migrant invasions and terrorism. Besides other countries are pulling out too, Poland and Sweden mentioned they might pull out next. You can have your own country so why would you want to be under the thumb of the Hague and the big brother EU.

brexit,"I will first begin my addressing the rebuttals made by my opponent to defend my arguments. My opponent started off by accusing me of not understanding opportunity cost. Let me assure him that I have quite a good idea of what opportunity cost means. He then brings in some technical terms with the hopes of confusing us to believe in him. Basically, he brushes off my argument which is the net high costs of remaining in the EU by accusing my data as biased and claiming that the opportunity of free trade justifies the cash. We have to remember that the costs of remaining in the EU have been rising STEADILY these past few years. If it has just been rising the last couple of years, yes, we might still be optimistic. But the truth is we are starting to question how much of a benefit this supposed free trade is when the figures have continuously been rising. When you consider that these costs are almost at par with medical costs in Britain, how long can we trick ourselves into thinking that ""you know, this is all for free trade. All this cost is justified."" And that is why I brought up the countries Norway and Switzerland. These countries are proof that you can stay out of the EU without having to succumb to membership fees. I was not at all implying that Britain should adopt a Nordic model. Of course, as a country with values of its own, they should negotiate a different treaty and a different model that suits them. Finally, I agree that America has no rights to comment on the Brexit. I was in no way implying that we should 'make Britain great again' as per Trump's model. And I never said that we should disallow refugees/migrants. I said that we should be able to draw our own laws up and not follow Brussel's laws, if for nothing else other than to maintain Britain's standing in the eyes of the world as an independent and strong nation. ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Now I will rebut my opponent's points. My opponent claimed that Britain throughout history has almost had strong ties with Europe and they have prospered. TO this argument, I will say that times have changed. When you look at how Greece, France and Spain's economies are struggling, you start to ask questions of how much longer Britain is expected to help out. My opponent then said Britain must not close its borders. Who said anything about closing borders? We will accept migrants and refugees but we will do so independently without Brussels ordering us what to do. Shutting down borders is totally different from remaining in the EU.

[2] Finally, England leaving the EU could lead to the volatility of the pound. This could lead to increased risk for businesses within India.

brexit,"Con’s Case: Con more or less dropped all of his arguments, and due to a lack of response, conceded to my rebuttals. In reference to his opening arguments, Con only made reference to the fact that it is common knowledge that the EU constitution is much longer than the American one. However, that’s beside the point, I didn’t even dispute that. What I disputed was the assumption made by Con that, because it’s longer, it leads to more corruption, prevents Europeans from fighting for their rights, and causes the EU to trample on people’s rights. Without any evidence to that effect, there is absolutely no reason to believe it. No instances of EU corruption, no instances of Europeans being confused over their rights, and no instances of Europeans losing their personal rights were provided by Con. Thus, without evidence, he is simply speculating and making assumptions. Con did not once reference his open borders argument and his argument about the benefit of independence was linked into his rebuttal on my arguments, so I’ll address that there. As it stands, however, Con’s arguments remain absent of any evidence. Rebuttal 3-Benefits of Independence/Argument 1-Economic Effects: Con attempt to mitigate the economic downturn by arguing that Britain will benefit in the long term. However, the evidence here is still shaky and the benefits of independence are still not made clear. Con begins by emphasizing the fact he stated in the previous round that “there will be a storm before the clear.” That’s nice, but it doesn’t mean anything, it’s an empty statement. I can say “when things go bad, they keep getting worse.” Again, it doesn’t mean anything without anything to back it up. However, he is basing his argument on the idea that Britain will climb back to its pre-Brexit economic state and that this is better, because it will be independent. Con provides some level of evidence for this, which I will address later. However, I highlighted last round that Con didn’t provide a reason why it is better to be independent: “For instance, there is no reason to accept the premise that being an independent nation is better. He simply states it, along with brief mentions of freedom of speech, national border protection, and national pride. Border protection has already been discussed, but he doesn’t show how the EU suppresses Britain’s freedom of speech or national pride; Con also fails to demonstrate why either of those helps the UK.” I might as well say it is better for the UK to be part of the EU, because it becomes more integrated with the rest of Europe. No explanation as to why being more integrated with the rest of Europe is better for the UK, but it’s the same level of reasoning done by Con as to why Britain would be better off independent. As for evidence that the UK will recover, Con just tries to downplay the EU’s effect on the British economy. He takes a bird’s eye view of the fact that the majority of Britain’s trade comes from non-EU nations and that the other EU nations benefit too much from their trade with Britain. However, it is important to realize that being in the EU opens Britain up to trade with a lot more than just EU nations. I will refer back to my opening argument in which I reference the EU making deals with the US and Japan, and it was calculated that it would have likely ended up saving British households a total of £6.3B. (1) Also, to expand on that point, the deals with the US and Japan would have given British businesses easier access to U32; of the world’s market (by value). (2) However, those are only two examples of EU trade deals with international markets. In order to appropriately rebut Con’s point, I’ll give more examples of how being in the EU gives Britain access to more than just European markets. The EU has separate deals with over 50 countries. As of right now, EU trade deals account for 60% of British trade. (2) However, when you also consider deals the EU is currently negotiating (such as the aforementioned ones with the US and Japan), EU trade deals could eventually account for 88% of British trade. (2) Another major deal to consider is the EU’s deal with South Korea. Following the EU-SK deal, British trade with South Korea increased over 50%. (2) This is no suprise, as not only is South Korea a growing economy, the EU allowed it to be much easier to trade with the South Koreans. Also, the EU’s recently signed deal with Canada would have potentially raised trade with Canada 29%. (2) I could go into more depth, but it should be clear, that Con’s statement that “over half of their trade will go unaltered” is misinformed and flat out wrong. Con will likely rebut that Britain could just remake the trade deals it has, but that is a foolish idea. Looking at Canada (who only exports about 3.2% less than Britain in value), we can see they have a lot less trade deals than Britain (as a member of the EU). (2, 3) This should be obvious, as signing a deal with all of the EU economies is more attractive than just signing a deal with one economy. Also, Britain will not have nearly as much negotiating power. With the weight of all the EU economies, it is much easier to gain favourable deals. This is obvious, because the EU has much more to offer than an independent UK does. This is why stronger nations such as China in the China-Switzerland deal, South Korea in the SK-Australia deal, and the EU in the EU-SK deal, get better deals and have more ability to dictate terms. (2) Therefore, it is undeniable that the UK will be unable to sign trade deals as good as they had with the EU. Finally, I will respond to Con’s point that his example of Germany will want to continue having the same deals with the UK. My opening argument addressed this idea, and the study provided still predicted a 1.1% decline each year in GDP. (1) Why? Because as mentioned above, the EU is a much stronger negotiating party than the UK and the UK loses its other deals mentioned above. Plus, we need to remember that as the UK becomes more isolated, the rest of the world is still globalized. Using Con’s source, Britain’s exports to Germany can be analyzed. Transportation (e.g. cars, aircraft and vehicle parts, motorcycles, etc.) and machinery (e.g. engines, computers, and telephones) account for 17.94% and 20.04% of Britain's exports to Germany, respectively. (4) These are primarily manufacturing sectors, and there is no reason to keep manufacturing jobs, such as these, in the UK when they can easily be relocated. I included a quote in my opening argument which explained that an independent UK would have its own safety restrictions and regulations, as well, making it more complicated for most companies to operate in the UK. Obviously, these companies would rather focus their efforts on the European market than the British market. Plus, one has to consider London’s large financial sector. I also showed in my opening argument how many banks are considering moving much of their operations from London to Frankfurt. Again, this is obvious, the market is much larger in a EU nation like Germany than an independent UK. Overall, it can be concluded that the chances of Britain bouncing back to its previous economic levels is wishful thinking and there is no reason to believe the UK is better off independent, as Con provided no evidence to that effect. Thus, Brexit will undeniably hurt Britain’s economy in the short and long run, with no forseen benefits. Finally, I will once again bring up my immigration point from my opening argument, which Con never touched. With the likely decrease in immigrants, Britain will have immense strains on its pensions and healthcare, and iwll have less workers for future generations. Obviously, this hurts the UK in the long term. Argument 2-Scotland: Con says I lacked any evidence that a divide of the UK would be a bad thing. I’ll briefly expand on this idea. We are not arguing what’s best for the Scottish people, we are arguing what is better for the nation, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. That nation currently includes Scotland. The UK losing Scotland undeniably makes the UK less powerful, that’s just a simple numbers game. In other words, we don’t care about how good it is for Scotland, if it hurts Britain. Now, Con argues that for Britain, having a border with a EU nation, will help it. This may be true, but to effectively rebut this, we have to consider what Britain also loses from Scotland, which will just strengthen my economic argument. In 2014, Scotland’s exports were worth £76B and Britain's total exports were $473B. (5, 6) Using today’s conversation rate, Scotland accounted for over 20% of Britain’s total exports. However, it is even more important to consider what Scotland has. Scotland contains many minerals (such as coal), suitable land for agriculture, and North Sea oil (which Con makes reference to). (5) These natural resources (most notably the oil as petroleum accounts for 11.4% of the UK’s exports) are sectors that cannot be relocated like a car plant can, weakening Britain’s negotiating power, further abroad. (6) Therefore, it is clear a separate Scotland will hurt the UK. Conclusion: Without any evidence, Con’s arguments hold no weight and his rebuttals of mine were ultimately unconvincing. It has clearly been demonstrated that in the long run the UK’s economy will be hurt by leaving the EU, through the loss of favourable trade deals and the likely decline of immigration. Also, it has clearly been demonstrated that an independent Scotland would hurt the UK. For this reason, it is clear that passing Brexit was a mistake, and I urge voters to vote Pro.

brexit,"I bid thank you to the fair proposition with their weak case, and loose ends. I stand on the opposition side for today, arguing for Britain to remain in the European Union (EU), I accept the definition given by the proposition on what Britain is, and will argue with the same spirit of the debate introduced, that whatever consensus that we come to, that it should be for the best interests of the British people. I will start with rebuttals, attempting to unravel the loose threads by the proposition. Firstly, when it comes to the matter of economics and specifically trade, it shows that the proposition had been brainwashed by Eurosceptics, with their fancy numbers that do not illustrate the real picture. The most basic concept in economics is opportunity cost, as long as the proposition do not understand this, and to and extent, the Eurosceptics, their figures should not be taken as an accurate representation of the costs incurred by remaining in the EU. The proposition talked about 'free trade' as it is something petty, when governments around the world are trying to lower transaction costs through Coase theorem in achieving Pareto efficiency. By remaining in the EU, Britain has free access to the single market without needing to negotiate treaties with respective countries they trade with. Yes, there would be issues that will arise when we remain in the EU, and I do not deny that, but I will continue with that rebuttal in my points as it relates a lot. The example of countries provided by the proposition is also very unfair, as it is very one sided and truthfully entirely irrelevant to the point that the instigstor is trying to make. Norway and Switzerland, yes, Switzerland, follow an economic model that is extremely unique, the Nordic Model. The Nordic Model follows the aspects of capitalism but is modified to comprise of socialist values. As that, to compare Britain and these Scandinavic economic countries is extremely irrelevant, as Britain follows a more liberal capitalistic economic values, and these values are not extinguished by remaining in the EU. On my last rebuttal, I will completely destroy the analogy given by the proposition when they brought the US into the fray, which ironically, happens today in reality. The Obama Administration has no rights to actively side for one segment of the referendum made for THE BRITISH. Also, as it is still called the Obama Administration, and not 'Trump Administration', it is unfair for the proposition to claim that the entire population of the great democracy that the US is, supports the building of this 'wall'. Also right, the hypocrite hear is actually the proposition, who wishes to build an artificial 'wall' by disallowing refugees to come in, what different is the instigator to the great Trump himself? Is the proposition's motto, ""Make Britain great again""? I assumed it is the refugee crisis that the proposition is referring to, as the migrant crisis and the refugee crisis are two different crises. Moving on to points. The first issue that we need to contend to is, the issue of multiculturalism. For that we need to go back to history. The British is not a people of its own, it is a creation of a cultural melting pot. The Celts, the Angles, the Saxons, the Frisians, the Normans, and to list all of them is just going to take very long, you get the point. Isolationist policies have never and should never be accepted by the British. A lot of Eurosceptics quote the moment when Europe was isolated from the rest of Catholic Europe during the Elizabethan Era and how they prospered. Again I must say, they were not isolationist at all, they were isolated, and because of that, they build trade partnerships with countries in the Mediterranean, and England prospered, not succumbed to recession. Still along the line of multiculturalism, the issue of migration must be be addressed. Be it the economic migrants, or the refugees seeking asylum, Britain must not close its borders. Let us first look into the issue of economic migrants. Only 44% of London's population are British Whites, and the rest are 'foreigners'. When the proposition made a very snarky remark, by saying that the migrant crisis, whichever that is, is very damaging to Britain, I felt that the instigator is being very insensitive. Not only that Britain is ready for foreigners, it also accepts these foreigners as a part of their own. Yes, there are bigots and dissenters who disagree, the proposition is obviously one, but the fact that the British people in itself is very multicultural, by closing our borders, we will just be going backwards. On the issue of refugees right, especially on refugees escaping Syria, it is very unfair for Britain, along with the EU, to disallow these refugees to seek refuge. It is no hidden secret, that the wars fought in Syria, is not a war by its own people anymore, but wars fought by foreigners, especially European powers. That is all for this round.",CON,"The Nordic Model follows the aspects of capitalism but is modified to comprise of socialist values. ...

death penalty,"""Lol you argue what is happening now. Also it was implied the current system is used in this debate."" My opponent has failed to explain why any kind of death penalty should be abolished. My opponent did not specify before the debate started that the topic of death penalty was only limited to its current use in the United States. My opponent wishes to make known of his intentions AFTER the debate started. I find this to be an irresponsible condition opposed upon me by my opponent because I accepted this debate only on the conditions of which were supplied at the time of acceptance. At the time, I was accepting the position of 'Pro' for A death penalty. Notice how neither the title of the debate nor anything written in the comments section before the debate started includes anything specific that says ""Resolved: The current death penalty system instituted in the United States should be abolished"". I am within my bounds to be arguing for a death penalty, not THE death penalty. In this case, I would like to supply some definitions: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Death - a permanent cessation of all vital functions : the end of life [1] Penalty - 1. A legal sentence. 2. A punishment for violating rules of procedure. [2] Punish - to subject to pain, loss, confinement, death, etc., as a penalty for some offense, transgression, or fault: to punish a criminal. [3] Voluntary - done, made, brought about, undertaken, etc., of one's own accord or by free choice: a voluntary contribution. [4] Recidivism - the act of a person repeating an undesirable behavior after they have either experienced negative consequences of that behavior, or have been treated or trained to extinguish that behavior. [6] ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ The definition of a death penalty can be construed from the definitions above as a legal sentence subjecting a person to death. My stance on the subject of a death penalty is that a death penalty should remain in the United States, but it should be entirely different than the current death penalty. A decision to undergo the death penalty should be a voluntary choice made by a convict who would have the option of life in prison or death. I have no doubt that a portion of criminals sentenced to life in prison would rather opt for the death penalty than a life sentence. This is evident by the fact that a large number of murder-suicides occur in the United States in which after a person commits murder, they take their own life. The source and evidence for this argument is listed in the first round of the debate. R1: Cost ""SO your ""the defendant chooses"" is false. The judge in the end chooses, defendant just gets to plea to try to weaken the sentence."" It is most definitely not false. In a voluntary death penalty, the defendant WOULD be able to choose. Remember, the argument is not about the current US death penalty, but is about A death penalty. So it is the trial itself under the DP that is expensive. That is what I have said all along. A voluntary death penalty would eliminate the bulk of the cost that it takes to execute a criminal because the legal appeals process which costs the most money would be eliminated. The appeals process exists because convicts who are fighting the state do not want to receive the death penalty. The people who would fight the death penalty in the future would not be sentenced to the death penalty in a voluntary death penalty, they would be sentenced to life in prison, therefore eliminating the appeals process in death penalties that costs the most amount of money in the current death penalty in the US. Also you concede that the DP costs more. I stated that the current death penalty costs more. A voluntary death penalty would cost so much less than the current death penalty, and would cost less than life in prison simply because the costs for food, health and shelter would amount to $0 after the criminal is executed. The states would actually save $1.5 million in living costs per convict if the convict opts for the voluntary death penalty over life in prison [5]. R2: The death penalty does not deter crime. The act of deterring crime is not the primary purpose of creating and enforcing rules for punishing lawbreakers. Fantastic. Then if deterrence isn't a major issue in deterring crime, then why are you debating that the death penalty doesn't deter crime if any other form of punishment isn't made to deter crime either? If the sole purpose of rules of law aren't even made to deter crime, you have just defeated your own argument. You make it seem that deterrence is a negligible issue. R3: The DP infringes international law. I agree with your statements on the current death penalty. But not all death penalties would violate this law. A voluntary death penalty would allow a convict to have more personal liberties than the current death penalty and a convict would also have the right to life or death based on his choice. R4: Risk of executing innocents I fail to see how an innocent person would want to opt for death under a voluntary death penalty. Even so, it's a person's right to life or death and a government shouldn't be infringing on 'international law' that you cite in this debate because it would infringe on liberty of the person to govern their own body. R5: Death sentences are racist and unfair ""Lol you argue what is happening now. Also it was implied the current system is used in this debate."" Like I said above, I am arguing for A death penalty, not the current death penalty. You did not specify that as a condition of the debate when I accepted the debate. Therefore you MUST convince the voters that the United States would be better off without a death penalty, and I am convincing the voters that the United States would be better with A death penalty. Notice that the topic is simply 'Death Penalty' and that you did not provide any additional information to what your resolution was for the debate. Therefore I am obligated to argue within my bounds, and my bounds are that I am arguing for a Death Penalty in the United States. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ In conclusion, the United States would be better off with a voluntary death penalty than without one at all. - It would be cheaper than life imprisonment by saving 1.5 million dollars per inmate. - It would give the convict the right to make a decision on their continuation of life. - It would eliminate the possibility of the criminal from being released back into society and committing recidivism. Voters: Because the debate resolution later admitted by my opponent was not provided at the beginning of the debate, I strongly urge you to base your decision on who convinced you more on the argument that a death penalty of some kind is better or worse than any kind of death penalty at all. I hope that after reviewing all of the debate, you make the right decision and vote Pro! :) Sources: 1. http://www.merriam-webster.com... 2. http://en.wiktionary.org... 3. http://dictionary.reference.com... 4. http://dictionary.reference.com... 5. http://www.heartsandminds.org... 6. http://en.wikipedia.org...",PRO,The source and evidence for this argument is listed in the first round of the debate. ... :) Sources: 1. http://www.merriam-webster.com... 2. http://en.wiktionary.org... 3. http://dictionary.reference.com... 4.,305,"['0.02913032490760088', '0.9708696961402893']",0.02913032490760088,0.9708696961402893
death penalty,"Thank you for replying. I was afraid you had permanently terminated your account. C1: Cost I believe that cost is an important factor in determining whether or not the death penalty should remain a part of the judicial system in the United States. Under the current system, the costs for life imprisonment is far less expensive than it is to institute the death penalty. This is because many defendants do not want the death penalty and will fight state governments for a long as 10 years, costing money in criminal trials, like you said, up to a total of $3 million dollars. But the fact is, the death penalty doesn't have to be mandatory. If the option between life in prison or the death penalty is given to the defendant, a large amount of money can be avoided from defendants fighting off the death penalty in courts. If the defendant opts for life in prison, the state will save 8 times the amount of money per case by avoiding a death penalty trial, since most of the money spent in a death penalty case is spent on the trial alone, not on the actual execution [1]. You may be wondering why criminals would even want the option to the death penalty, like I have mentioned. Sometimes ""[criminals] feel it is an act of kindness to them. The argument here is - Is life imprisonment a crueler fate?"" [2] And often times criminals see death as a way to escape their guilt. If you look at statistics for murder suicides in the United States, 1,000 to 1,500 murder-suicides occur every year [3]. If the murderers were caught before they took their own life, I would be certain that they would want to seek the death penalty, rather than life in prison. This is based on the fact that if they didn't want to die, they didn't have to kill themselves. But because they killed themselves, they were seeking death. C2: The death penalty does not deter crime. The death penalty does deter crime because offenders will not be able to repeat their offense once they are dead. In your solution for deterring crime, you suggest that murder rates can be ""curbed by addressing the environmental and social factors that contribute to violent crime"" and then cited a quote that ""The murder rate is most closely associated with the socioeconomic health of the country. The murder rate in the U.S. was highest during the Depression."" I ask you this one question: Does the fact that the economy is bad gives criminals the right to commit murders? Your proposed alternative to the death penalty is to address the environmental and social factors that contribute to violent crime. If the government can't fix the economy, and a bad economy (like you have mentioned) is responsible for higher murder rates, it would be impossible to address the issues that contribute to crime, and crime would flourish if the environmental and social factors can't be addressed. Therefore, your solution to preventing crime is much less effective at doing so than a voluntary death penalty or even the current one under effect in the US. C3: The DP infringes international law. You mentioned in the comments section of this debate that this was about a death penalty in the United States. Regarding a death penalty, it is perfectly legal in the United States under the 5th amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Why should international law matter when you said this debate was in regard to the United States? C4: Risk of executing innocents Under a voluntary death penalty, this would no longer become an issue. C5: Death sentences are racist and unfair Under a voluntary death penalty, death sentences would not be given out by the state government, but would be given by the defendant. It would be up to the defendant to choose life in prison or the death penalty. ------------------------------ My opponent finished his 1st round of the debate by arguing that the death penalty is ""unfair, kills innocents, and doesn't even serve it's deterrence purpose, and on top of that is is expensive"". But what my opponent ignores is that the death penalty can still exist without causing all of those things to happen. A voluntary death penalty, one which the defendant can choose over life imprisonment, will negate the issue of what is fair or isn't fair because grand juries will no longer be sentencing defendants to the exact form of punishment, but will hand over the option of death to the defendant. A voluntary death penalty will negate the issue of killing innocents. It will be up to the defendant to decide whether his death is right for him or not. And while my opponent argues that the death penalty does not deter criminals from committing crimes, he does not provide a viable solution that does deter criminals from committing crimes. And when my opponent says that the death penalty is expensive, he ignores how expensive it would be to improve environmental and social factors in the United States, a solution he offers as a way to deter crime in America. A voluntary death penalty would be much more cheaper because the defendant would not be resisting death if he opts for the death penalty over life in prison, thus avoiding a lengthy, expensive chain of criminal trials for 1 single defendant.

The cost One my argue by logic that the cost is much higher for life imprisonment because you would have to feed him everyday etc.... for the rest of their lives right. # A 2003 legislative audit in Kansas found that the estimated cost of a death penalty case was 70% more than the cost of a comparable non-death penalty case. Death penalty case costs were counted through to execution (median cost $1.26 million). Non-death penalty case costs were counted through to the end of incarceration (median cost $740,000). (December 2003 Survey by the Kansas Legislative Post Audit) # In Tennessee, death penalty trials cost an average of 48% more than the average cost of trials in which prosecutors seek life imprisonment. (2004 Report from Tennessee Comptroller of the Treasury Office of Research) # In Maryland death penalty cases cost 3 times more than non-death penalty cases, or $3 million for a single case. (Urban Institute, The Cost of the Death Penalty in Maryland, March 2008) # In California the current system costs $137 million per year; it would cost $11.5 million for a system without the death penalty. Innocence I will start off with a quote from Governor George Ryan of Illinois ""I cannot support a system which, in its administration, has proven so fraught with error and has come so close to the ultimate nightmare, the state's taking of innocent life... Until I can be sure that everyone sentenced to death in Illinois is truly guilty, until I can be sure with moral certainty that no innocent man or woman is facing a lethal injection, no one will meet that fate."" Since 1973, 130 people have been released from death rows throughout the country due to evidence of their wrongful convictions. In 2003 alone, 10 wrongfully convicted defendants were released from death row. 3.

death penalty,"The United States has several ways on how criminals should be punished. The most important punishments are serving time in prison and the death penalty. The death penalty is the worst punishment that a judge could sentence a defendant. The death penalty should be removed from the punishments the United States provides for its defendants, because in many cases it is not a 100% chance that the defendant did in fact commit the crime. In cases where the defendant actually did commit the crime, they should still be convicted a life sentence in prison, rather than the death penalty. If the death penalty is sentenced to a defendant, who according to evidence presented in court did in fact commit the crime, instead of this being the worst thing that could ever happen, it could be an easy way out; the defendant to not serve a life sentence. When it comes to money, the United States may be spending more per having prisoners serve life sentences, then sentencing the life sentence. However, the death penalty is still not a way of justice. The death penalty is a waste of taxpayers' money, and has no public safety benefit. Instead, the death penalty has a main motive of revenge, instead of justice. The death penalty can be considered as violating the U.S. Constitution, because it is considered a cruel and unusual punishment, and the guarantees of the due process of law and of equal protection under the law are violated. The States should not give themselves the right to kill human beings, whatever the crime may have been, it is much more revenge than it is justice. According to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the majority of the law enforcement professionals, surveyed agree that capital punishment does not deter violent crime; a survey of police chiefs nationwide found they rank the death penalty lowest among ways to reduce violent crimes. It is obvious that even law enforcement professionals do not agree with the death penalty. The death penalty does not stop crimes that continue in the streets every day, it only kills one human being who may have committed the crime they are being accused of. If money is the issue for having too many prisoners, there is such a thing as rehabilitation centers, which is what prisons are sentenced certain amount of time to serve in the first place. It is much better to have someone spend their life in prison, rather than giving them the easy way out through the death penalty. The doubt of someone actually committing the crime they are being accused of, and going forward with the death penalty is a doubt that will not go away. The fact that an innocent human being was sentenced to the death penalty is a life that is lost and cannot be gained back. The fatal constitutional infirmity in the punishment of death, is that it treats members of the human race as nonhuman, as objects to be toyed with and discarded. Lives should not be toyed with when facing a severe punishment as the death penalty. Aside from the death penalty being the worst punishment, the need for a physician to be present to conduct the procedure is in violation of the oath they take upon, which is to protect lives; this erodes public confidence in the medical profession. The use of a physician's clinical skill and judgment for purposes other than promoting an individual's health and welfare undermines a basic ethical foundation of medicine, which is to do no harm. Instead of the death penalty being a way of stopping crimes, the fact that one person is being named for committing a crime is not accurate, it violates the Constitution, and more importantly those physicians who are certified to save lives , are going against their oath and helping with the prosecution.",CON,"When it comes to money, the United States may be spending more per having prisoners serve life sentences, then sentencing the life sentence. ...

death penalty,"Opening Arguments : The system of law and order is all about justice but where do draw the line to were we become the very evil we wish to destroy. Murder is murder and capital punishment is just that murder, simple to just kill killers but what does that make you? It makes you a killer but with public opinion on your side and a notion of justice which isn't the case. Why is it that America holds a sanctity for life, and yet kill people for killing people how does that make sense its hypocritical. Case: 1. The death penalty can and has killed innocent people, the government has killed innocents making it murder. Under the death penalty rules technically all the people in the cases with innocent people killed should themselves be put on trial and killed. However it doesn't work that way, the accused is the only one getting blamed for a crime and if innocent but proven guilty will get the death penalty but then proven innocent after the sentence has already been carried out the government just goes oops sorry. 2. Death penalty cost more than life in prison without parole. Evidence : Dudley Sharp, Death Penalty Resources Director of Justice For All (JFA), in an Oct. 1, 1997 Justice for All presentation titled ""Death Penalty and Sentencing Information,"" wrote: ""Many opponents present, as fact, that the cost of the death penalty is so expensive (at least $2 million per case?), that we must choose life without parole ('LWOP') at a cost of $1 million for 50 years. Predictably, these pronouncements may be entirely false. JFA estimates that LWOP cases will cost $1.2 million - $3.6 million more than equivalent death penalty cases. There is no question that the up front costs of the death penalty are significantly higher than for equivalent LWOP cases. There also appears to be no question that, over time, equivalent LWOP cases are much more expensive... than death penalty cases. Opponents ludicrously claim that the death penalty costs, over time, 3-10 times more than LWOP.""

death penalty,"Rebuttal 1: Why not just do it with a firing squad? Let them donate the guns and ammunition to kill them. Let the family or concerned citizens execute them or you can just hang them or use the electric chair. All of these are cost efficient ways of executing the death penalty. My opponent may also state that the trial will take longer, but the trial is going to cost money anyways. Death penalty or no death penalty. We can shorten the trials. My opponent also needs to take into account how much money it takes to feed someone for life.

States have different Almost all of these non-death penalty states, are generally small states. You also have to take into account gun control and general crime in the area.

You fail to take into account the general crime and culture of the area there! Rebuttal 3: You have one case where the U.S got it wrong. The burning of the DNA test could've just been an error. That is not a problem with the death penalty. it is a problem with the jobs the cops do on the trail, and can easily be fixed.

Rebuttal 5: MY OPPONENT HAS ADDMITED THAT THE DEATH PENALTY DETURED CRIME. In states with more murders, the death penalty has helped lower like Texas, Louisiana, and Alabama. These are where many murders happen, and they have started to go down. So, a main chunk of that is the states with the death penalty. Then I ask you this, why do criminals, when they go to court, ask for life and not death. People commit stupid things because YOLO.

death penalty,"The death penalty has a purpose. People who have killed many and even thousands cant be sentence to death? Death penalty should exist because when someone commits a crime that's so violent the end result can cause hundreds to die. If there is no death penalty then the maniac will still kill more people. Death penalty is used to get rid of bad people so bad that hundreds die. If you think the Death penalty is bad because it kills people you must not know what the purpose of it is. The death penalty is a way to put fear into the criminal and to put fear into others. Crime has decreased and the death penalty still lives. Several tests have shown that the death penalty is an effective deterrent of future crimes. Do people who commit heinous crimes, such as the bombers, really have human rights. To say that we are lowering ourselves to that level is wrong. Killing over 200 innocent lives. We have to look as well at the possibilities of these criminals committing crimes again. In Australia murder, on average, is imprisonment for 12 years. This means many murders are set free, able to commit further crimes. Benefits of death penalty - decreases jail over population - puts fear into other criminals and shows a purpose - It avenges innocent lives - It decreases crime.

death penalty,"My opponent speaks no form of fact or statistic but morally on his/her opinion. I could sit here and talk about how I think the death penalty is good. But i'm not using facts or sources. If you need a reason on why the death penalty is a good idea; here are a few. One small but important reason on why the death penalty is a good idea is that it decreases the prisoner population, which saves even more tax payers money. Another reason why the death penalty is a good idea, Once a criminal is executed, he cannot kill again. The case for this would be Kenneth Allen McDuff who was on Death Row when the death penalty was declared unconstitutional in the 1970's. His sentence was commuted to life and he was eventually released on parole and killed again. He has since been executed My final reason for this round is that the death penalty is actually a very good deterrence. If you look at this link: http://www.prodeathpenalty.com... You see a chart. The chart is documenting the number of yearly homicide rate per 100,000 population. The chart also documents the years 1950-2002. Lastly, the chart documents the yearly number of executions.

death penalty,"I offer my thanks to my opponent for his quick reply. However, I do hope he actually reads my sources. I am not simply making statements devoid of supportive data. ""Life imprisonment is less costly?"" Yes. [1] Life imprisonment is less costly for a variety of reasons, far beyond lethal injection costs. It is more costly because of a lengthy appeals process. It is more costly because you can not free a dead man, which means that all appeals must be exhausted before sentencing is carried out. It is more costly because a person who is to be executed needs to be guarded more closely. It is more costly because someone dies, and that costs a life. ""Imagine how much more money this country would save if we put our murderers to death the moment they are convicted of the crime."" This is a separate argument for the death penalty. It is one of modification rather than continuation. I will answer it regardless, but I fail to see how it supports your resolution that the death penalty remain in the United States. Would we save money if we immediately killed those convicted of murder the first time, assuming no appeal? Yes. We would also have a 12% chance of killing an innocent. [2] That would just be murder sanctioned by the state. Furthermore, it is unconstitutional. You can not deprive a person of life or liberty without applying due process of the law. [3] That includes the appeals process. You are claiming that the death penalty should be modified so that it can be a justified expense in the United States. However, the way you have gone about justifying it is completely un-American. """"The death penalty does not deter."" Says you? I am pretty sure that is a matter of opinion."" It is a matter of fact. In every state that has abolished the death penalty, murder rates have decreased. This is not proof that the death penalty causes murder. It is however proof that there is no correlation between the death penalty and the prevention of murder. Deterrence **is only evident** if there is a correlation between implementation and prevention. Clearly, there is not. [4] ""The death penalty would in fact prevent more people from being murdered."" It does not. If you live where the death penalty is applied, you are more likely to be killed than if you did not. See above. ""In the end you are saving more lives then you are killing."" A murderer does not get to justify his murders by saying they were mostly bad guys. Neither should the state. ""The overall murder rate jump doesn't prove that the death penalty doesn't work the way its supposed too, that is do to a multiple of different factors including the moral decline of the U.S."" Please explain the source of the purported moral decline of the United States. If you think it is a lack of faith, I'm sorry to say it isn't. [5] [6] ""The state of North Carolina banned the death penalty in 2001. North Carolina had seen a pretty subtle decline in the murder rate for many years leading up to 2001 after it was decided to ban execution in the state … North Carolina has seen a subtle increase in murder rates in more recent years."" You are wrong. North Carolina is a death penalty state on the graph you cited. It still has the death penalty. [7] [1] http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org...

death penalty,"I can understand a victim's family's frustration at the thought of a killer getting away with what he has done. This seems to be what so many think happens when a killer avoids the death penalty. I will argue that not only is the death penalty not effective in preventing crime or bringing a victim back but is nothing but a costly state funded revenge killing. (1)Detterance Some will argue that the death penalty helps keep murder rates down by scaring would be criminals, at the thought of being put to death, into not commiting hard crimes. The theory goes that if one is about to murder someone he/she might be persuaded not do so out of fear that he will be put to death. This is definitely not the case. From 2003-2008 there were thirty countries in the world who had murder rates of 1.5 or less murders in every 100,000 people. Of these thirty, twenty had completely abolished the death penalty while ten still have the death penalty partially or fully in place.[1] Surely if the death penalty really had a deterring effect, there would be more countries in the top thirty with the death penalty than without. Iceland, a country that has abolished the death penalty, has the overall lowest murder rate in the world.[1] (2)Costs In California, taxpayers pay an estimated $90,000 more per death row prisoner each year than on prisoners in regular confinement. Just in California, if the death penalty were changed to life without parole, California taxpayers could save 125.5 million dollars annually.[2][3] This is because, when the death penalty is being seeked, after being convicted of the crime, the suspect must go through a very long process of appeals and sentencing to make sure he/she is not convicted of a crime he/she did not commit. This coupled with the arbitrariness of a punishment which neither rehabilitates criminals nor prevents crime makes the death penalty not worth it . (3)Arbitrariness Again, the death penalty does not really punish someone in that they are out and dead in 1, 2, 3. That is it, no more punishment after that. They basically get away with it like Hitler. Second, this does nothing to benefit society in the longrun. You could say that it takes out dangerous criminals. But can't we do that anyways by putting them in prison for life for a fraction of the cost? And doesn't it seem like a far worse punishment to sit and rot in a prison until you die in ripe old age then to go out in a second and be free from all responsibility? (4)Wrong guy There is also the possibility that one could be killed while being innocent. If we find out that a man was wrongly convicted of murder even ten years after the case, at least that man can one day walk out of prison. If that man was put to death on the other hand, all you can do is apologize to the suspect's family and apologize for killing an innocent and slandering his name. There are no backsies when it comes to the death penalty. My main reasoning stands that: A-The death penalty, contrary to what many say, has not been shown to deter criminals from commiting crimes. B-The cost of the death penalty is much higher than to put a person in prison for life. This is a complete waste of hundreds of millions of dollars of tax payer money. This money could be better used for rehabilitation or to help stop crimes before they happen. C-It is a much more effective punishment to make someone rot in a tiny cell for fifty years then to shut off their lights in a few seconds. D-There is no fixing a mistake like killing the wrong guy.

(Albeit Indirectly). This has caused many problem for people who went to youtube with google+. The problem is not google+, it's the combination that neither side wanted. Google+ people did not want their account associated with the pit of **** that is youtube comments, and youtubers didn't want to have the incredible inconvenience that is Google+. Point 2: As for point number 2, notice the big section below that was not noticed by con. Anyways, moving on. Point 3. Here are multiple help Pages that show this problem, with hundreds of likes.

Bob's army is different in the respect that people want it to spread, which is why it is more noticeable. Also note: The official video has has over 32000 comments deleted due to spam and virus links. 5. The point isn't getting to it, it's getting the button to do anything, which as evidenced in the video I cited, doesn't. Also, Comments that are marked as spam are barely viewable, so thumbs up isn't going to do much of anything. 6. If It wasn't broken (Which I contend it wasn't), it doesn't need to be changed. If the Google+ update was worth it, then yes, by all means go ahead and break it. But it wasn't. And the problem still remains. 7 & 8. These inconveniences cause people to either not join, comment negatively, and do not cater to the user, the people who give youtube money. These inconveniences take away from youtube as a whole, and don't give in return.

google,"So that we may set the platform for this debate, I would like to ""reword"" the argument statement to -- ""Is the Google Review Rating System good or bad? "" I would also add that, This is not necessarily the statement I agree with, More so what can be inferred from the context of the debate. Do you agree? As I understand it, But feel free to correct me if I am wrong. These are your supporting arguments to the argument statement above. 1) All reviews are 100 percent safe. 2) Guaranteed ranking on your Google business, Maps, And places 3) It""s a significant component of any prosperous marketing campaign. Do you agree? As it is my turn for a statement, I would first like to object to the following. 1) In your statement you are making an assumption that ""All"" is ""safe"". I would say that it is not possible to have all reviews are safe, Because there is no way to guarantee ""safety"". So that we are on the same page, The listed definition of safe is; protected from or not exposed to danger or risk; not likely to be harmed or lost. I would say there is no way to guarantee even the case where it is ""not likely"". Cities are designed to have all the available resources within reach for the populace to survive. These ""Cities"" have a common understanding of the way things need to work in order to ""function"". ""Cities"" have plenty of ""safety"" regulations that are governed by ""law"" which is enforced in order to ""function"". Even then of the countless number of ways that we have tried to guarantee safety through history--we have never been able to. ""Crime"" does exist within the populace and it is the only 100% certainty I see. So my objection to this statement would be, Logic cannot guarantee safety, Because there will always be an object that will purposefully circumvent commands that are expect a specific result to function. This I state as 100% guaranteed. If this is so, And bad and good are the measurement of success and the achievement of 100% is the criteria, Then I would say; The Google Review System is Bad.

People wouldn't suffer from cholesterol, diabetes, strokes, and some cancers. Many people wouldn't die from heart problems. 2) Its kind. It is unnecessary to be killing animals in order to feed and clothe ourselves. Plants can keep us alive. Some slaughter houses, are really cruel to animals. http://www.youtube.com... 3) Better for the environment . Meat production uses up alt of land and water. Cows expel amounts of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Their hooves pack the dirt, making it less likely for it to absorb the rain. Manure from animal industrial facilities leaks into waterways, and gets into the groundwater. 4) Its delicious. People from all over the over the world have created plant-based dishes.

vegan,"This debate is about a vegan diet. Vegans are distinct from vegetarians in not eating any fish, dairy, eggs, or animal byproducts, whereas various types of vegetarianism permit some of these things. The resolution is that a vegan diets well-planned by a lay person are healthier than the corresponding non-vegan well-planned diets. A lay person is a person without specialized training or fanatical zeal. There are No Examples of Vegan Populations with Better Health If a vegan diet is healthier than surely Pro would lead off by pointing to some group of vegans somewhere who have better health than the average non-planning meat eater who survives on the typical dietary disasters overloaded with fat, cholesterol, and surplus calories. However, Pro did lead with such data, no where in the debate did he ever point to a single group of vegans with better health than people who eat meat promiscuously. I fully expected that there would be some vegan monks who live forever on soybeans. But no, Pro presented no data on vegans than put them ahead of hamburger gobblers, let alone careful balanced eaters. Broad studies show that the best health is enjoyed by people who have low-meat diets or fish diets. Vegans and those undisciplined meat eaters have the worse health. Vegetarians consuming dairy are somewhere in between in health. Pro made a small error in the saying that vegan data was skewed by having lots on non-smokers in the study group; actually it was the vegetarians who benefited from being non-smokers. Small groups of people adopt particular diets based upon tradition or religious beliefs. With these groups we expect to get closer to ""well-planned"" goals. Again, the big winners were groups having low-meat diets. Okinawans have the longest life expectancy in the world; there diet has fish and small amounts of meat. Vegetarians of the lax varieties do well; vegans are no to be seen in the most healthy populations. Theoretical Nutrition Because Pro has no data showing vegan populations having health better than meat-eaters, he must construct a theoretical argument based upon nutrients that would be in the hypothetical well-planned vegan. Pro points to all vitamins, fiber, and unsaturated fats available to vegans. He shows that there are vegan foods with enough protein and iron to avoid deficiencies. I agree. there are many healthful nutrients in vegetables. Pro points out that supplements are available to augment the Vitamin B12 and Vitamin D shortfalls characteristics of vegan diets. I again agree. It is possible to obtain a healthy diet within the bounds of vegan eating. But being theoretically able to have good health on a vegan diet does not suggest that a vegan diet is healthier than a non-vegan All the vegetables are available to those who also consume meat. At best the vegan diet can be equally healthy. The resolution requires Pro to prove that a vegan diet is not just equal, but superior. In fact, a diet containing almost entirely meat and fish can provide required nutrients. “What the diet of the Far North illustrates, says Harold Draper, a biochemist and expert in Eskimo nutrition, is that there are no essential foods—only essential nutrients. And humans can get those nutrients from diverse and eye-opening sources.” Health Hazards Pro correctly points out that unplanned meat diets tend to have too many calories an too much saturated fat. Well-planned diets with meat do not have too much. Vegan diets tend to have too little protein, vitamin B12, iron, omega-3s, Vitamin D, calcium, and iodine. Careful planning can avoid those shortfalls, but vegans typically do not do the needed planning, so vegan health is typically no better than unplanned meat eating. Since a balanced diet of meat and vegetables has all of the vegetable nutrients, the only way a meat diet can be less healthy is if there is something inherently bad in meat. Cholesterol, saturated fat, and calories are not inherently bad. Planning solves the potential hazards of getting too much. Vegans can get too much saturated fats from oils (coconut, palm, cottonseed), Saturated fats induce the liver to make cholesterol, so there is a cholesterol hazard. Vegans can certainly get too many calories (sugar, french fries, donuts, etc.). That too can be avoided by planning. The only potential inherent harms in meat are cancer risk from processed meats (like ham) or from more than 18 ounces of red meat per week. That's avoided by not eating processed meats, and eating less than 18 ounces of red meat. There is no identified risk from white meat, fish, dairy, or eggs. Hence there is no unavoidable risk in a diet that includes meat. A study by the WCRF claimed a correlation between red meat and cancer above the 18 ounce point. The study was examined by a scientific consulting company, Exponent, and found to be flawed. Pro claimed that Exponent could not be trusted for the sole reason that their results defended the meat industry. If that logic were true, then we should discount forensic evidence for the defense in a criminal trial on the sole grounds the expert is for the defendant. Pro claimed that I had presented nothing that indicated that it was a scientific controversy. What I presented were the very specific scientific objections raised by Exponent. Moreover, WCRF revised their report by publishing an errata in response to the objections. Clearly the objections were scientific. While admitting scientific errors, WCRF refused to modify their conclusions. In the process, they betrayed an anti-meat-industry bias. The burden of proof is upon Pro, and Pro did not respond to the specific scientific objections made. Vegan Diet Planning Making a well-planned balanced diet is not altogether trivial. Meat eaters must avoid too much red meat, too much saturated fat, and must avoid process meats. they must not consume too many calories. Vegans have a much more difficult task. They must make sure they do not consume too many calories or too much saturated-fat vegetable oil. The must also be sure they get enough protein, vitamin B12, iron, omega-3s, Vitamin D, calcium, and iodine. A profession nutritionist recommended that vegetarians track nutrients daily. The planning is greatly complicated by the vegan ground rule of no meat by-products. Pro said that all vegans need do is read the labels on food packages. That is insufficient because labels do not say what is animal based and what is plant based. The reference I gave tells that lecithin and gelatin are animal products. That's not common knowledge. Some vitamin supplements are animal-derived, others are plant-derived and that information is not disclosed. Minor or trace ingredients, like animal-based clarifiers in beer, are not disclosed. Restaurants do not have ingredient labeling. Even with labeled foods, reading every label and researching what is animal-derived is not an everyday task. We know that vegans don't do the needed planning because their health is no better than unplanned meat-eaters. Low-meat balanced diets have little or no problem with planning. A balanced diet is healthiest The American Heart Association, American Institute for Cancer Research, the American Institute for Health, and the World Cancer Research Fund all recommend a low-meat balanced diet for the best health. None recommend a vegan diet and Pro presented no authoritative recommendation for a vegan diet. Pro ignored many of my arguments. He never disputed that the source of nutrients doesn't matter. He didn't dispute that only calories cause obesity. Vegan diet is in practice less healthy, and at best it can only equal a low-meat balanced diet. The resolution is negated. ----- Thanks to Pro for a good topic and a fine debate. I learned much from researching this debate.

vegan,"We""re all busy, Pro. Glad you could make it back to the debate. At this moment, your profile states that you are male, so you""ll want to change that if you want people to refer to you as a female. I""m assuming you believe in the Bible and God since you listed in your profile you are Catholic. ""Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things."" King James Bible (KJB) Genesis 9:3 ""Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils; Forbidding to marry, [and commanding] to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth. For every creature of God [is] good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving: For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer."" KJB 1 Timothy 1,3-5 The above scriptures from a work that many religions around the world deem the word of God proclaims that animals were created for human use and consumption. Timothy also stated that abstaining from meat would be comparable to forbidding to marry or giving heed to seducing spirits. The video you posted did show some gruesome footage. I couldn""t work at a slaughterhouse, and I couldn""t be a surgeon simply because I am disgusted by cutting flesh and blood. The people who do slaughter animals are very important to the rest of us who use animal products for food, clothing, and other products. Regarding the health benefits of a vegan diet, I agree that eating a lot of meat is less healthy than eating a little meat. However, it is true that eating fruits and vegetables alone is not sufficient for the body to get the good Omega 3 fatty acids, vitamin D, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12 it needs. These nutrients are needed to survive as a human, and supplementation is usually needed to get a sufficient amount. http://en.wikipedia.org... Therefore, until recently (when supplementation products were created), people could not really become vegan and get the nutrients they needed. Pro""s second argument about being kind is valid. However, we as humans can enjoy a better quality of life by utilizing animals that share this planet with us. For example the use of down feathers, if well cared for, retain its loft up to three times longer than do most synthetics. http://en.wikipedia.org... Even in an advanced age of technology, products coming from animals are cheaper to produce and can function better than the synthetic replacements. Pro argued that ""meat production uses up a lot of land and water."" ""A lot"" is a very relative term. In fact, I can argue that pro uses a lot of land and water. Use of a resource is good if the outcome brings benefit. Dairies and ranchers raise cows and use the necessary resources so they can sell milk and meat that most people want to buy and use. The value of that outcome really depends on what someone is willing to pay for it. Vegans do not value the animal products, so they will not pay for it. However, restaurants sell plates of seafood and meat anywhere from less than a dollar on into the thousands of dollars. People value animal products, and so the resources used to create the valued productd are not wasted. By saying that cows shouldn""t be raised because they pack the dirt with their hooves simply shows that Pro is a hypocrite unless she can fly. Every time you walk on the grass, you pack it and make it less likely for water to be absorbed. When you build a house and put in a sidewalk, a patio, and a driveway, you are preventing all rain from absorbing into the ground in those locations. The argument about methane is moot as this argument is not about greenhouse gases or what that does. That subject should be argued in a separate topic. There are no sources pointing to manure getting into groundwater and why that might be a problem. I agree that fruits and vegetables are delicious, but so are meat, milk, fish, and poultry. Yes, there are vegan versions of familiar foods, but they are specialty foods, which increases the cost of production. If you want a vegan mayonnaise replacement, it will cost you. If you want a meat replacement, it will cost more than regular meat most of the time. Only when vegan practices become widespread will the market follow suit and be able to produce animal product replacements in higher quantities for the greater discount. If you""re part of a destitute family or in a third world country, veganism is out of the question. Anything that can be consumed will be consumed in those cases. Conflict will be a major part of life for vegans. If family members aren""t all vegans, Thanksgiving dinner, Christmas dinner, going out to eat, and family get-togethers will all include moments of conflict about eating habits. Like I proposed in my earlier argument, veganism is like a religion. The vegan lifestyle will be debated just like religious beliefs are debated in families. For example, a common vegan story is similar to this one: ""Some members of my family had strong objections to me removing dairy products from my diet, believing I""d be socially ostracised. This caused a regular conflict at meal times, especially since I wasn""t cooking my own food for dinner, so whoever was cooking would have to prepare a vegan meal as well as a carnivorous one."" http://rohanmitchell.com... Family is about love, but it""s also about sharing common beliefs and goals. When someone changes a major part of their life so it is not sharable and extra food needs to be prepared for one person, it can become a stage for conflict. Pro has failed to prove her point about why veganism is a better lifestyle than all other eating lifestyles. She failed to provide a second round argument, and she failed to rebut my initial argument about the animosity ethical vegans have toward others who leave their group. There are plenty of reasons why not to go vegan including the extra expenses due to lack of mass production of non-animal products, the religious manner in which ethical vegans conduct themselves and excommunicate the apostates from their group, and the social awkwardness and conflict veganism creates when eating with non-vegan people - especially family.",CON,"Use of a resource is good if the outcome brings benefit. ...

vegan,"Well-Planned Diets are to be Compared The resolution is ""Resolved: Well planned vegan diets are healthier than their meat-based counterparts."" The counterpart to a well-planned vegan diet is a well planned meat-based diet. I take a ""meat-based diet"" to be any diet that includes meat on a regular basis. For example, if a vegan diet is used with some of the protein from beans replaced with protein from fish, then Pro must prove that the departure from strict vegetarianism results in poorer health. I contend that any diet, vegan or non-vegan. that provides all of the nutrients needed, and at the same time avoids excessive amount of unhealthy nutrients will produce the same nutrition-based health. Pro's initial argument, I claim, amounts to saying that a well-planned vegan diet is less healthy than a poorly planned diet with meat. Vegans are extraordinarily health-conscious compared to the average. Why else would a person eschew a great variety of tasty foods in favor of a restricted diet? Okay, sometimes people are vegetarians for religious reasons, but they are nonetheless diet-conscious -- they are not casually consuming whatever tastes good. It should not be surprising that any person who is fanatical about diet or health will end up with better health than one who is not., all other things equal. Comparing the average vegan with the average non-vegan does not support the resolution, since the average non-vegan is not adhering to the ""well-planned diet"" requirement. For example, the longest-lived population in the world are the residents of Okinawa. They do not eat a vegan diet, They eat a balanced diet that includes animal proteins in reasonable quantities along with vegetables. ""Meat, poultry, and eggs account for just 3% of the diet, fish about 11%."" http://www.wellnessletter.com... Okinawans are not typical non-vegans, but they are a good approximation having the ""well-planned"" non-vegan diet. Their health is better than most vegetarian societies. 2. Cholesterol is Fine in Moderation Pro points to cholesterol as a critical dangerous component of meat. Cholesterol is one of those things necessary for health, but harmful in excess. In is something like vitamin D in that the body can manufacture it or it can be obtained from food. Too little Vitamin D causes a deficiency disease, but too much is extremely toxic. A vegetarian can get too much cholesterol from diet. ""... coconut oil may be cholesterol free, but is highly saturated and more dangerous than seafood, as it causes the liver to produce more harmful cholesterol. Saturated fat also raises triglyceride levels and thickens the blood. ... Seafood, on the other hand, contains cholesterol, but also the protective polyunsaturated fats that cause the liver to produce less harmful cholesterol and more protective HDL cholesterol. ... That's why, rather than worry about high cholesterol foods, you should pay attention to foods high in saturated fats."" http://www.all-about-lowering-cholesterol.com... A well-planned vegan diet will avoid that problem, but so will a well-planned non-vegan diet, both by avoiding saturated fats. 3. Obesity is From Calories, not Meat Obesity causes health risks. However, it is certainly the case that some vegans are obese and many non-vegans are not obese. For example, a study showed ""Roman gladiators were overweight vegetarians and not the muscle-bound men portrayed by actors"" http://www.abc.net.au... All that matters is how many calories the person consumes, not whether the calories are plant or animal. ""Obesity is most commonly caused by a combination of excessive dietary calories, lack of physical activity, and genetic susceptibility, '"" http://en.wikipedia.org... Again, it is reasonable that vegans are obese than average people, because vegans are diet conscious, vegetables have lower energy density than meat, and to many people meat tastes better. However, a well-planned non-vegan diet also has the proper amount of calories. 4. Statistics Show No Vegetarian Advantage If there were, as Pro claims, some inherent health problem with non-vegan diets, than vegans should have a consistent health advantage. Even though vegans tend to be health conscious, the statistics show no advantage. A metastudy compiles the data from many studies into one. ""The metastudy reported mortality ratios, where lower numbers indicated fewer deaths, for fish eaters to be 0.82, vegetarians to be 0.84, occasional meat eaters to be 0.84. Regular meat eaters and vegans shared the highest mortality ratio of 1.00. The study reported the numbers of deaths in each category, and expected error ranges for each ratio, and adjustments made to the data. However, the ""lower mortality was due largely to the relatively low prevalence of smoking in these [vegetarian] cohorts."" http://en.wikipedia.org... Other studies of certain selected vegetarian populations show some marginal advantage in life expectancy, but it seems that non-diet factors are responsible, Other factors are not-smoking, higher income and lower stress levels. A National Geographic Study http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com... gives a sense of the factors. Those long-lived Okinawans have low stress and void smoking along with a fish-centric diet. 5. Science Favors a Balanced Diet The National Institutes of Health recommends a balanced diet that includes meat, fish, and dairy. http://www.nlm.nih.gov... A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association Nutrition Committee states: ""...consume a diet rich in vegetables and fruits; choose whole-grain, high-fiber foods; consume fish, especially oily fish, at least twice a week; limit intake of saturated fat to 7% of energy, trans fat to1% of energy, and cholesterol to 300 mg/day by choosing lean meats and vegetable alternatives, fat-free (skim) or low-fat (1% fat) dairy products and minimize intake of partially hydrogenated fats; minimize intake of beverages and foods with added sugars; choose and prepare foods with little or no salt;"" http://circ.ahajournals.org... It might be argued that vegan diets are healthier because it's easier for the average person to make a well-planned diet. It's easier in some ways, because it's likely that vegans will get more fiber and less saturated fat without much extra effort. However, the disadvantages are more than an offset. Vitamin B12 is in virtually all meat, but "" vegans will lack B12 unless they consume B12-containing dietary supplements or B12-fortified foods."" http://en.wikipedia.org... Deficiency of B12 produces pernicious anemia, which s fatal if untreated. ""Vegetarians often have normal hemoglobin, but low iron stores (ferritin) in liver, muscles and bone marrow. Iron absorption is improved by including Vitamin C (75 mg per meal or about 6 oz orange juice) along with an iron supplement (as much as 50 mg per day) and high iron foods."" http://www.dietitian.com... Those who eat little red meat can also have iron deficiency, but the body naturally cravings for red meat when iron is low, so the problem is more easily recognized. ""For the most part, vegetarians get adequate protein if they eat a balanced vegetarian diet. In fact a healthy vegetarian diet usually exceeds protein requirements. ... The best way to make sure you're getting enough nutrients , including protein, is to keep track of the foods you eat on a daily basis."" http://vegetarian.lovetoknow.com... In sum, vegan diets are no healthier than meat-based diets. Both must be ""well-planned.""",CON,"Too little Vitamin D causes a deficiency disease, but too much is extremely toxic. ...

vegan,"It Doesn't Matter Whether Essential Nutrients are Plant or Animal Discovery Magazine published The Inuit Paradox: How can people who gorge on fat and rarely see a vegetable be healthier than we are? http://discovermagazine.com...= Inuits are the Eskimos of northern Alaska, Canada, and Greenland, whose diets include very few vegetables. They nonetheless have half the rates of heart disease of typical Canadians and Americans. “What the diet of the Far North illustrates, says Harold Draper, a biochemist and expert in Eskimo nutrition, is that there are no essential foods—only essential nutrients. And humans can get those nutrients from diverse and eye-opening sources.” The Inuits get vitamins, notably vitamin C, from organ meats. The fat from wild animals is largely unsaturated, and the large quantities of omega-3s in their diet helps offset the fats. Raw fish and raw meat have important amino acids that are otherwise obtained from plants. So if your diet is mostly seal blubber and caribou, be sure to balance it with liver and raw fish. The point is that people need certain nutrients, and it doesn't matter whether the nutrients come from plants or animals, or, such as the B12 Pro advocates, from chemical synthesis. A perfectly-planned vegan diet will therefore be no better and no worse than a perfectly-planned diet that contains meat. Both will have all the essential nutrients, and neither will have too much of anything that poses a health risk. I think that Pro wasted a great deal of space in this debate providing lists of nutrients that are found in plants and claiming that nutrients are nutritious. It's true that all those plant nutrients are in plants and that humans need them. All the plant nutrients are available to people who eat both plants and meat, so that is not an advantage of a vegan diet. There is No Inherent Health Risk in Meat Pro offered the possibility that meat posed an inherent cancer risk, so that a diet with meat would be less healthy. However, dairy, eggs, fish, and chicken have no such risk, and red meat poses no such risk if less 18 ounces per week is consumed. Vegans face cancer risks from sugars, fried starches, and refined flour, so their planning problem is not solved by just avoiding meat. The Well-Planned Diet If “well-planned” means “perfectly-planned,” i.e., having all essential nutrients and not too much of anything, and if the average person can accomplish the planning required, then the resolution still fails. The resolution claims that the vegan diet is healthier, and it is no healthier. In the last round of the debate, Pro considered vegan diet planning for protein, vitamin B12, and omega-3s. I have indeed agreed that vegans can get enough protein, and I additionally agree that vegans can get enough B12 and omega-3s. The question is not whether it is possible, but whether the planning is reasonable for the average person. In addition, vegans must plan to ensure they get enough iron, zinc, and additional nutrients. An Australian study showed that using tables of nutrient requirements deign for meat eater is insufficient for vegans: ""Meat, poultry and fish-based meals provide good quantities of vitamin B-12, omega-3 fats, iron and zinc. Legumes, nuts and seeds, on the other hand, do not contain vitamin B-12, important for the normal functioning of the brain, or long-chain omega-3 fats, required for the brain and maintaining a healthy heart. What’s more, the iron and zinc content of a plant-based meal is not as easily absorbed by the body as a meat-based one. ... Professor Katrine Baghurst, key author of the study comments: 'People need to be aware that they should not simply substitute a portion of a plant-based food for a portion of meat and expect to receive the same nutritional benefits.'"" http://www.girl.com.au... Vegans must also plan n order to get enough vitamin D, calcium, and iodine. http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au... Vitamin D is generated in the body upon exposure to sunlight, but that's insufficient in northern climates. The usual source is fortified milk, which most people get ordinarily. Vegans must seek fortified soy milk or some other fortified product. Vitamin D is toxic in large doses, so concentrated supplements are not sold. The advice from a nutritionist to vegetarians is ""The best way to make sure you're getting enough nutrients, including protein, is to keep track of the foods you eat on a daily basis."" How Difficult is Vegan Diet Planning? Vegan has to plan under the constraint that they do not include meat or animal-derived products In the fabled ""land of milk and honey"" both milk and honey are disallowed to vegans. Pork chops are obvious, but there are dozens of so-called ""hidden"" meat products. http://www.cyberparent.com... The list of items to be avoided begins Worcestershire sauce, Caesar salad dressing, pizza topping, Greek salads, packaged cookies and crackers, refried beans, flour tortillas, ready-made pie crusts, bottled juices, colored pasta, some candies, frozen pops, garlic salt, vanilla, meat tenderizers, salad-dressing mixes, ice cream, candy, baked goods, chewing gum, liquor, wine, vinegar, beer, fruit juice, soft drinks, mmarshmallows, yogurt, frosted cereals, gelatin-containing desserts, molded salads ... and continues at length. Life is possible without any of these things (excepting maybe beer, but I assume there is vegan beer made without the animal-derived clarifying agent) but the list of things to be avoided limits where the desired nutrients are allowably obtained by vegans. Since vegans dismiss red meat as too high a cancer risk, they must similarly dismiss tropical oils and fried starches. Pro emphasizes that a vegan diet is naturally lower in cholesterol and calories than an unplanned meat-consuming diet, but the bottom line is that vegans have no better overall health than unconstrained meat-eaters. That tells us that the planning difficulties in areas other than cholesterol and calories are so great as to completely offset those advantages. The healthiest diet actually observed is the low-meat diet. Pro claimed that the planning to keep red meat consumption below 18 ounces. Fast-food franchises, being extremely health conscious, convenient sell red meat in increments called ""quarter-pounders."" This makes tracking trivial. Also, a number of the low-meat diets exclude red meat entirely while consuming some combination of white meat, fish, and dairy. The Resolution is Negated Well-planned vegan or non-vegan diets will be equally nutritious, so the resolution fails. However, it's doubtful that the average person can plan a vegan diet considering all the nutrients that must be given care and the constraints of obtaining them without animal sources. The resolution therefore also fails on the grounds that a non-fanatical layman cannot accomplish the planning to level required. I remind Pro that debate etiquette does not allow adding new arguments in the final round, which is for summarizing and for analyzing the flow of the debate. The reason is that new arguments or data introduced so late cannot be properly debated.

vegan,"I want to thank Roy for responding with a well researched, well cited, and well written rebuttal. I'll open by showing the evidence proving meat causes cancer. Then, I'll address mortality rates, B12, and some other issues Con raised. I will discuss obesity and iron in round 3. Cancer Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the developing world[1] (the first being CVD[2]). The most comprehensive document on diet and cancer to date is ""Food, Nutrition, Physical Activity and the Prevention of Cancer: a Global Perspective""[3]. This report based its findings on 4,500 credible scientific studies and was conducted by the American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) and the World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF)[4]. From this study, two things can be said with certainty[4]: * Vegetable and fruit consumption is associated with lower risk of cancer at almost every cancer site[4]. * Meat and animal fats are detrimental[4]. According to the report, vegan dietary components (vegetables, fruits, carotenoids, vitamin c, fiber and whole grains) are the most consistently protective to cancer sites[5]. Meat, animal fat and saturated fats are the most consistently harmful dietary components to 5 cancer sites (stomach, breast, prostate, pancreas, lung) [5]. Fat, grilling/barbecuing and dairy products are the most consistently harmful dietary components to 4 cancer sites (prostate, colon, breast, stomach) [5]. The AICR and WCRF recommendations for cancer risk reduction include: * Adopt a plant-based diet rich with ""vegetables, fruits, whole grains and legumes such as beans.""[6] * Adopt a high-fiber diet containing whole-grain bread and pasta, oats and vegetables and fruits.[6] * Maintain a low body weight[9]. The study's authors point out that plant-based foods have fewer calories and lend themselves well to this goal[6]. * Adopt a plant-based diet to reduce your consumption of energy-dense foods[7]. * Eat no more than 18 oz. (cooked weight) per week of red meats, like beef, pork and lamb, and avoid processed meat such as ham, bacon, salami, hot dogs and sausages[8]. It's clear from the evidence presented above that our very best science on the subject concludes that meat is a major cause of cancer. That same science also makes clear that plant-based foods are consistently protective to cancer sites. Rebuttal Protein Con conceded that vegetarians (though not vegans) get adequate amounts of protein. Could I, the proponent of veganism, really have won the protein argument so quickly and with no effort. I encourage Con to take another shot at this unless he truly does concede that well planned vegans diets provide enough protein. Vegan: Health Fanatics Con claims, without citation, that vegans are health fanatics and he based several arguments on this. Though the vegan diet is the healthiest and most rational to adopt, most become vegan/vegetarian for ethical reasons[28]. Only 29% become vegans/vegetarian for health reasons[28]. Two-thirds of vegan/vegetarians claim to have never obtained information on vegan diets[28]. Many of Con's arguments are spoiled by this demographic evidence. Cholesterol and Saturated Fats Vegetarians can indeed get too much cholesterol though this is irrelevant as the resolution addresses vegans. A vegan consumes no dietary cholesterol and does not need to. There are a hand full of plant sources that are high in saturated fat (coconut oil, cottonseed oil, etc...)[25]. These are rare and a well planned vegan diet would not make these foods routine. Indeed saturated fats are to be minimized in the diet. Vegan diets are very low in saturated fats[26] however meat eaters have a hard time reducing their intake[27]. Mortality The metastudy Con uses shows that vegans and meat-eaters share similar mortality rates while pesca-vegetarian and lacto-ovo vegetarians live the longest. It's clear (and will become clearer) why meat eaters have high mortality rates. So why do vegetarians (pesca- and lacto-ovo-) live longer than vegans? Much can be said against fish, eggs and milk (saturated fats, cholesterol, calories, toxicity[19][20][21]). However, they are good sources of omega-3s[24] and B12[21]. Since, on average, vegans are untutored in dietetics it may be assume that many vegans have not taken measures to obtain enough B12 and omega-3s. Those deficient in B12 are at risk for early mortality, heart disease and stroke[23]. Those with low levels of omega-3s are at greater risk for cancer and CVD[22]. Well planned vegan diet contain adequate amounts of omega-3s and B12; the nutrients that likely cause vegetarians to live longer. B12 Pro says B12 is ""virtually all meat"". However, the true source of B12 is not meat but rather bacteria[12]. Livestock animal are contaminated with B12-producing bacteria they obtain from the soil and manure in their feed[13]. However, B12 does not have to come from unhealthy animal sources. B12 can be extracted directly from the B12-producing bacteria. This B12 is used to fortify breakfast cereals[11], non-dairy beverages[10] and protein bars[14]. One cup[15] of my favorite brand of soy milk contains 100% of an adult's daily requirement of B12[10]. So which is better: B12 from contaminated animals or B12 direct from the bacterial source? When animals absorb B12 it becomes bound to the animal's protein molecules[16][12]. This makes it hard for many people to absorb B12[12][17]. These people develop B12 deficiencies and must consume the more easily absorbed B12 that vegans rely on[18]. The B12 found in fortified, plant-based foods is easily absorbed and is considered reliable[18]. 1 http://books.google.com...

vegan,"Interesting topic ... The Latest Study Shows Meat Does Not Cause Cancer The studies cited by Pro have been superseded by a more recent study: A new study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, however, has refuted that earlier research's claims. After conducting a thorough review of the WCRF's study, scientists Dr. Stewart Truswell, of the University of Sydney, and Dr. Dominik Alexander, of Exponent, concluded that ""there is no conclusive evidence of a causal relationship"" between eating meat and developing cancer"". In the WCRF's defense, Prof. Martin Wiseman, Project Director of the report, said, ""We say explicitly that red meat has important nutritional benefits and do not recommend avoiding it altogether"".http://topnews.us... The recommendations of the AICR and WCRF cited by Pro were not for a vegan diet. Pro incorrectly concluded that if a high-vegetable diet was good, that an all-vegetable diet would be better. WCRF recommended a low-meat diet, but explicitly endorsed meat consumption, saying "" red meat has important nutritional benefits and do not recommend avoiding it altogether."" Whatever risks posed by meat are, according to the study Pro cited, outweighed by the benefits of meat eaten in modest quantities. That's consistent with the Okinawan diet, consumed by the world's longest-lived population. They eat meat in modest quantities and live the longest. Too much is bad, but zero is also bad Consider salt. Increasing amounts of salt produce worse health. However, having no salt is fatal. The same is true of fats, proteins, and, in the extreme, even water. For many things in the diet there is an amount that is optimum for health. That is true for meat. The optimum amount appears to be around that in the Okinawan diet. As I referenced them, that view is endorsed by the National Institute for Health, the American Heart Association, and Pro's cited authority, the World Cancer Research Fund. Pro has not provided a single authoritative source that claims that a vegan diet is better than a low-meat balanced diet. Eating vegetables also causes cancer. Researchers have linked increased use of nitrate fertilisers to an alarming rise in gullet cancer in Britain....'It appears that the mass production of vegetables in the Western world since the last world war may be the underlying factor that has led to such huge increases in this form of cancer,' he added. ... McColl said it was unlikely that organic food would be any healthier, because it also contained substantial levels of nitrate, some of which came from natural fertilisers such as manure. http://www.guardian.co.uk... More generally, the list of foods causing the highest risk of cancer comprises sugar; processed meats; doughnuts, french fries, and other fried starchy foods; and chips, crackers, and cookies. http://www.naturalnews.com... Other than processed meat, all the foods declared most risky are vegan. Vegan planning is beyond the average person I suggested that only health fanaticism would motivate a vegan diet, deducing this from the burdens of diet restrictions. It did not occur to me that refusal to drink milk or catch sardines was ethically motivated. However, Pro cites good evidence, and I accept his argument. It is an ethical belief akin to the religious prohibitions. It is explained as a quasi-religious practice. This explains another troubling piece of data: in the comprehensive metastudy vegans had higher mortality rates than non-strict vegetarians, fish eaters, and occasional meat eaters. The vegans fared no better than those eating unconstrained meat diets. While it is theoretically possible to get enough protein, iron, B12, omega-3 fats, and other nutrients from vegetables, doing so essentially requires a spreadsheet. Recall the nutritionist advice I cited: ""The best way to make sure you're getting enough nutrients , including protein, is to keep track of the foods you eat on a daily basis."" In other words, vegans can get enough protein and other essentials, but often-enough they don't. This is similar to saying that meat-eaters can avoid being overweight by restricting their calories, but they don't. The difference is that vegans fail by lack planning, while meat-eaters fail by lack of will. Pro defined ""well-planned"" as ""A diet which can be designed by a layperson with a reasonable amount of research."" To track protein, iron, B12, saturated-fat induced cholesterol, omega-3s, and all the other stuff on a daily basis requires more research and record keeping than the average layman can sustain, and the solid evidence is that vegans don't do it. I conceded that vegans could get enough protein, and that's true. The problem is that they usually don't. Meat-eaters could restrict their intake of calories and cholesterol, they just usually don't. However, a well-planned balanced diet is within the ability of the average person. It's mainly calories and saturated fats. If the body needs iron, the practitioner of a balanced diet will crave it and is allowed to eat accordingly. Vegans need complex spreadsheets. Vegetarians vs. Vegans Pro asked why vegetarians had better health than vegans, and he conjectured that it was due to getting more B12 and omega-3s. Perhaps, but (see the original quote) the study said it was mostly because their vegetarian sample was dominated by non-smokers. Without the unrelated benefit of not smoking, the healthiest diets were those who ate modest amounts of meat or modest amounts of fish. B12 B12 is produced by the bacteria in dirt, for sure, but its consumed naturally in meat. Pro suggests that the B12 prepared for supplements is less contaminated, but he offers no evidence that ""less contaminated"" B12 provides better health. The human digestive system harbors a menagerie of bacteria, and B12 bacteria are compatible. http://www.vegan-nutritionista.com... Moreover, there is evidence that too much cleanliness contributes to allergies, as the immune system looks for something to attack. http://www.everydayhealth.com... Saturated-fat Vegetable Oils Pro conceded there are unhealthy vegetable oils (coconut, cottonseed, palm, etc.) that induce high cholesterol, but said they are rare. In fact, these oils are common and their use is increasing: ""Palm oil is a common cooking ingredient in the tropical belt of Africa, Southeast Asia and parts of Brazil. Its increasing use in the commercial food industry in other parts of the world is buoyed by its lower cost] and the high oxidative stability (saturation) of the refined product when used for frying."" http://en.wikipedia.org... In the US, they are often in imported products like instant noodles. Pro says that vegans can avoid them. That is another item to be taken into account in the ""well planned vegan diet."" It must go on the spreadsheet for daily monitoring for traces of meat, fish, or dairy poducts; B12; iron; protein; omega-3s; sugar; doughnuts or french fries; and cookies, chips, or crackers. That's too much to tack for any layman who is not a health fanatic, and we have agreed that vegans are not health fanatics. Summary Studies show that people who consume modest amounts of meat or fish have better health than vegans. The National Institute of Health, American Heart Association, and World Cancer Research Fund all recommend a balanced diet that includes meat. The longest-lived populations consume meat. Pro persists in comparing unplanned diets having meat with a theoretically optimum vegan diet.

vegan,"So far I've given the evidence showing that animal-based foods cause CVD, cancer and diabetes. In this round I will highlight the virtues of plant-based foods. As usual my rebuttals will follow. I will provide the authoritative sources advocating vegan diets in round 5 instead of here due to space constraints. I will also address Con's claim, that a modest amounts of meat is better than no meat, in round 5. Plant-based Foods When animal-based foods are excluded from the diet, there is more room on the plate for plant-based foods. Plant-based foods are high in fiber[1], contain no dietary cholesterol[2] and are low in saturated fats[3]. Fiber (which animal-based foods lack[1]) lowers cholesterol levels, improves blood sugar control, reduces the risk of gastrointestinal disorders, aids in weight loss, and normalizes bowel movements.[1] Phytochemicals Phytochemicals are substances found exclusively in plant foods which confer a protective influence on us[4]. A diet which derives more of its calories from plant-based foods will necessarily have more phytochemicals. Where animal-based diets cause cancer and cardiovascular disease, the phytochemicals in plants actually work to counter the risk of these diseases. The following will be a detailed look at phytochemicals in various types of vegetable and their antioxidant, anticancer, anti-CVD, antiviral and antibacterial properties. Cruciferous vegetables (i.e. broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage) have[9]: * Indoles and isothiocyanates (anti-cancer) Umbelliferous vegetables such as celery, carrots and parsnips have[9]: * Coumarins (anti-CVD) * Flavones (antioxidant, anticancer, anti-CVD) * Carotenoids (antioxidant, anticancer, immune-enhancing effects) * Phthalides and polyacetylenes (anti-tumor) Allium vegetables like garlic, onions, leeks, etc... have[9]: * Allicin (anti-CVD, antiviral, antibacterial, anticancer) * Ajoenes (anti-thrombotic) * Vinyldithiins (antiasthmatic, antithrombotic) * Allyl sulfides (anticancer, anti-CVD) Citrus fruits have[9]: * Flavonoids (anticancer, anti-CVD) * D-limonene (anti-CVD, carotenoids) Grapes and their juice have[9]: * Flavonols (anticancer, anti-CVD) * Anthocyanins (strong antioxidant) * Resveratrol (antioxidant, anti-clotting, anticancer, anti-inflammatory) Berries have[9]: * Anthocyanins (strong antioxidant) * Flavonols (anticancer, anti-CVD) * Phenolic acid (antioxidant, anticancer) Whole grains have[9]: * Phenolic acid (antioxidant, anticancer) * Lignans (a possible anticancer agent) * Phytates and tocotrienols (antioxidant) Legumes have[9]: * Isoflavones (antiestrogenic, antioxidant) * Lignans and phytates Nuts and seeds have[9]: * Flavononols, phenolic acid, lignans and phytic acids (anticancer) and tocotrienals Rebuttal Vegans Need Spreadsheets Despite my pleas, I could not get Con to argue that vegans can't get enough protein in their diet. Con is wise in not pursuing this. Despite popular misconceptions, the plant kingdom is abundant in high quality sources of protein and vegans can, with ease, obtain all of the essential amino acids in adequate quantities[5]. This includes vegan athletes who often require 3-4 times the amount of protein recommended for non-athletes[5]. I contend that vegans are at no disadvantage with regard to protein though I concede that poorly planned vegan diets may be low in B12 or omega-3. So far, I think it is fair to say that Con and I are in agreement. Con wants to argue, though, that a well planned vegan diet is beyond the average person because spreadsheets would be required to keep track of B12, iron, protein and omega-3 intake. Research shows that there is no significant difference in the intake of iron between vegans and meat-eaters[6]. Also, on average, vegans meet dietary recommendations for protein[10][11]. So this leave us with the question: How can a vegan get enough B12 and omega-3s? As I stated earlier, a cup a fortified soy milk provide a daily allowance of B12. Daily consumption of fortified soy milk, modest amounts of flax seed and walnuts will meet recommendations for omega-3[7][8]. As you can see, it is extremely easy for vegans to obtain what they need on a diet that has been well planned. Is it so easy for meat eaters though? The meat eater has to always be on guard against exceeding the 18oz. (cooked weight) weekly limit of red meat or else they will be at a greater risk for cancer? How can meat eaters know for sure how much cholesterol and saturated fats they've consumed on any given day (substances which lead to greater risk of CVD and that are virtually absent in a vegan diet)? Is it not hard for meat eaters to calculate the fiber they are consuming to ensure adequate intake? Could it not be argued that a spreadsheet would be required for all of this? WCRF Cancer Study Controversy Con wasn't able to prove the review to be anything more than a controversy between science and industry. B12 I didn't say the B12 producing bacteria are contaminated. I said livestock animals are contaminated/infested with B12 producing bacteria. My argument was that B12, when bound to animal protein, is harder to absorb than B12 extracted directly from the bacterial source. (Protein bonds are difficult to break). B12, extracted directly from bacteria, is used to fortify foods and is better than protein bound B12 because it is easier to absorb. 1 http://www.mayoclinic.com... 2 http://findarticles.com... 3 http://www.livestrong.com... 4 http://www.phytochemicals.info... 5 http://www.adajournal.org... 6 http://www.ajcn.org... 7 http://silksoymilk.com... 8 http://www.vrg.org... 9 http://books.google.com...

vegan,"Outline I. Intro II. Animal suffering ethics III. Environment IV. Health V. Conclusion VI. Sources I. Intro Thanks for accepting this debate. I will be arguing that every adult in first world countries should be vegan. Exceptions, rare medical conditions, extraordinary circumstances, and lab grown meat. [0] Examples of extraordinary circumstances would be stuck on a desert island or in an elevator shaft. There are three main points to my argument, animal suffering & ethics, environment issues, and health concerns. As a responsible adult and productive member of society I feel it is necessary to take care of one's health, the environment, and to show compassion for animals. II. Animal suffering ethics First and foremost is animal suffering and ethics. Claim 0: There is no survival need to eat animal products. Warrant 0: ""Typically, vegans can avoid nutritional problems if appropriate food choices are made. Their health status appears to be at least as good as other vegetarians, such as lactoovovegetarians.""[1] Impact: Any suffering via the raising, transportation, and breeding of livestock can be seen as animal cruelty. Vegan is the morally superior path. Claim 1: Animals suffer greatly during factory farming. Warrant 1: Common knowledge. Impact 1: When combined with the fact that we don't need to eat meat to survive and the abundance of wealth in 1st world countries, factory farming has no relevant difference than dog fighting, pig wrestling, pigeon shooting, and cock fighting. We are simply eating meat for pleasure at the cost of great suffering and pain to animals. This is animal cruelty. Halt a large portion of animal cruelty by becoming vegan. Claim 2: Humans have drawn an arbitrary line between animals and humans. Warrant 2: Richard Dawkins a famous person known for his intellect says so. [2] Impact 2: This is a cruel double standard. Such a double standard is an injustice. ""Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere."" [3] Martin Luther King, Jr. As long as such an injustice is allowed to stand, a threat to justice everywhere remains. Become vegan today to help remedy this injustice. Claim 3: Cage-free, free range, pasture raised, and their variants are a form of humane washing. Warrant 3: ""the movement to treat farm animals better is based on the idea that it is wrong to subject them to unnecessary harm; yet, killing animals we have no need to eat constitutes the ultimate act of unnecessary harm."" [4] Impact 3: While factory farming is common knowledge humane washing is not. Not only does humane washing have the injustice of animal cruelty but of deliberate deceit to the public. Adults in 1st world countries should become vegan thus boycotting such products. III. Environment If you paid attention in elementary level science class you learned about the food chain, autotrophs, heterotrophs, and tropic levels. That each trophic level requires significantly higher amount of biomass and thus energy. Therefore, it is logical to eat at a lower level in the food chain, plants instead of animals. Cows require up to sixteen pounds of grain to produce one pound of beef. Then, there is destructive fishing habits, rain forest deforestation to clear land for cows, and so forth. IV. Health I think it is immoral to carelessly destroy your health and leech off of the various forms of welfare and public assistance. I ideally a person should repay his or her society and become an industrious citizen. There are many health benefits from becoming vegan with little health concerns. The benefits including receiving plenty of the good while avoiding the bad. The good being antioxidants, fiber and phytonutrients. The bad being excess fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, heterocyclic amines, endotoxins, and IGF-1. V. Conclusion The first world is plagued by immoral and morbidly obese humans leeching off not only their own nations but destroying the environment for everyone. We can no longer afford to allow these evil humans to desecrate our morals and future. They will hide behind their religions and selfish ideologies, nevertheless we cannot afford to be infinitely patient. For justice, the environment, and your health become vegan today.

nuclear energy,"I'm in favour for nuclear energy. For economical reasons, nuclear energy has strong benefits. Like my opponent said, nuclear power plants are expensive to build and we need to use energy for building it. But the main mistake that we make is we are looking too close to this subject. Nuclear power plant is an energy source which can give us highly more energy then others. If we compare a nuclear power plant with thermal power plant, we can clearly see that nuclear energy will gain us what we lost while we're building the centrals. And the ending of the fossil fuels are really close(1). We're dependent on thermal power and fuels so nuclear energy will be a useful hand of help. For environmental reasons, nuclear energy has many radioactive wastes. But I think that we can agree on something: The worlds most important problem is Global Worming. It will destroy us slowly. And that's why we're our children to be careful and be aware of the effects of global warming. Now whit this fabulous energy type, we have a chance to and the global warming. For the effects of nuclear power plants, I need you to know that 95% of the energy generated by nuclear burn up is without any waste of CO2. So we should use nuclear energy to stop our biggest problem in the world. For the risks, Nuclear radiation is risky but the radiation will leave the central only if there is a crack in the central. We had seen it in Chernobyl, but now, we have a better technology and better scientist. We need to trust on our people to make this energy useful. Secondly., radiation is an important factor but we can't prove that the cancer is caused by the nuclear radiation. Of course it will effect the human health but ,we, people experience a lot of technological devices in our daily lives, like phones or televisions. Are we going to get rid of them just because of radiation? And the cancers are highly caused because of portable telephones, especially(2). Radars, satellite stations and microwave ovens operate also high radio frequencies. 1:http://www.forbes.com... 2:http://www.cancer.gov...",PRO,We're dependent on thermal power and fuels so nuclear energy will be a useful hand of help. ... 1:http://www.forbes.com... 2:http://www.cancer.gov...,511,"['0.18721662615425885', '0.8127833753824234']",0.18721662615425885,0.8127833753824234
nuclear energy,"I will begin with my opponent's case and then present an alternative to nuclear energy. Opening statement: My opponent has produced some very impressive data on the efficiency of nuclear energy. Prima facie or first glance could easily sway a person to support nuclear energy. I vaguely recall having done rudimentary research on nuclear energy for a Lincoln-Douglas topic last fall. In fact, a conversation I had with our science department head revealed only one significant pitfall, what to do with the waste? My opponent has even identified dis-ads of nuclear waste and offered suggestions on the very subject of nuclear waste. If we dig deeper though, what are other concerns? Let's explore! 1) Effectiveness. At first glance the only disagreements I could identify were really nitpicky stuff. I could say that some of the water which became steam would inevitably evaporate and have to be replaced. I could even strengthen my opponent's defense by saying that the moving parts replacement schedule is likely very minimal. There is no shame in expanding Robert Fulton's use of steam even if it is an old idea. We still use wheels right? :o) There is no doubt that nuclear energy can offer power to communities. I, and the judges, are likely tired of semantical battles of topicality, that being said; much of my opponent's first point are stipulated and conceded. 2) Safety. This is a cause for concern. While technologically developed nations such as the U.S.A., the U.K., and France have operated plants for upwards of 60 years without serious incident, that does not make them immune to trouble. Many safeguards have been implemented since the 1950's to improve and upgrade the facilities. Yet, even superpowers such as the U.S. (3 mile island) and the former Soviet Union (Chernobyl) have had their share of growing pains. Most recently, another developed nation, Japan, experienced a calamity of catastrophic proportion. Are nuclear power plants compeletly safe? No. Now consider lesser developed nations that are seeking nuclear power, Iran and North Korea for example. Both are suspect for being politically unstable as well as using nuclear energy to develop nuclear weapons. Oversight can be a tricky thing when a more radical nation prefers not to be inspected or have other's watching over their shoulders as they attempt to develop energy, or secretly weaponry. This forces them to be sneaky, which may lead to shortcuts, which may lead to disaster. Security of nuclear facilities. There are high protocol, likely classified, to protect the integrity of nuclear facilities in developed nations. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for less stable nations. Can anyone, with any certainty, verify the count of every spent rod or piece of weaponry from the the Former Soviet Union, especially after the breakup of the former into 15 separate and independent nations? I would have to say no. Further, what would prevent well organized and well funded terrorists from acquiring nuclear materials in lesser developed nations? This too eats away at the safety argument. An article I discovered addresses nuclear waste in a different light than that of my opponent. Like my opponent, it identfied waste that was short term and had reduced effects with proper handling and recycling. Also, like my opponent it identified longer term waste. However; the safety of the longer term waste was the compelling factor. It is quite dangerous, ecologically unfriendly, and can take an estimated 1000 years to decay. http://www.scienceclarified.com... These are a few ""what if"" or otherwise hypothetical scenarios that challenge nuclear energy safety as well as historical examples such as 3 mile island, Chernobyl, and Japan. While precautions and protocol do exist, they are far from foolproof, and are not necessarily as safe as my opponent would have us believe. http://www.nirs.org... 3) Costs. My opponent has demonstrated that nuclear energy does indeed exceed the effectiveness of fossil fuels. It's common knowledge and widely accepted that once established, nuclear is more logical than fossil. It appears to be cleaner in emissions, and uses fewer resources in producing more energy. At first glance, this seems to make perfect sense. This leads me to ask a question. Why then isn't everyone using nuclear energy then? A Smithsonian study showed that only approximately 16% of the worl'd energy is nuclear based. Since it is demonstrably more effective as shown by my opponent's CBA, why aren't most nations using it? Simply put, the necessary precautions make it cost prohibitive. Many African and Central American nations struggle to even provide basic necessities to their citizens. Citizens in African nations do not enjoy clean water, adequate food, clothing, or shelter. Haiti and Honduras don't even have a pot to piss in. In fact, many nations have substandard living conditions to include plumbing and basic sanitation. Constructing a nuclear power plant is not in their foreseeable future. My case: At first glance my alternative seems to be a reinvention of the wheel. There are alternatives to nuclear energy though. All of which can be done at a fraction of the cost of nuclear energy, and boast a much better safety record. HYDRO: Every nation does have rivers. Dams can be constructed, and power can be retrieved via hydro energy. SOLAR: Especially with so many ""experts"" verifying the existence of greenhouse gases and global warming, you would think that would open the door even wider for good ol' solar power. Yes the sun shines all over the earth! Yes, solar panels are expensive, and yes, at present they need to be rather large to capture this energy. Why can't every roof be a solar panel? This is worth research and development money! Opportunity is knocking! (For my beloved Israelis, I am offering triple mitzvah points if you discover it first) Who among us on this earth will be the first to develop more efficient solar power for all to enjoy? WIND: The wind blows. Meterologists have ways to track weather and determine the most strategic locations to place wind energy generators. KINETIC GENERATORS: Quite possibly the world's best kept secret! These puppies are built at a nominal cost, and run virtually clean, quiet, and very efficient. This is probably the better answer to the energy crisis. We (Collectively) have put boo-koodles of investment money into so many things. It makes sense to look into research for the large scale, big picture. http://www.homestandbygeneratorsystems.com... In closing: While nuclear energy is a better alternative than fossil fuels, it has yet to replace them. Why? It is both dangerous, and cost prohibitive. I am suggesting that nuclear energy research monies be diverted toward large scale research of kinetic generators.

nuclear energy,"There once was a saying that went something like this. The enemy of my enemy is my friend. Clearly, this is not the case for neither my opponent, nor myself. The non-renewable bubbas are quick to dismiss anything positive, and exacerbate anything negative that would threaten their cash flow. Welcome to modified capitalosm. Voting issues: 1. There is no doubt that nuclear energy works. 2. Likewise, there is no doubt that there ae inherent dangers associated with nuclear, and we have yet to discover a feasible way to dispose of the toxic waste without further endangering lives and ecology. 3. Start up costs clearly make it prohibitive for much of the world. 4. As only a handful can afford it, nuclear constitutes only 16%. This deduces that 84% comes from alternative sources. I have demonstrated that the 3 headed renewable energies, wind, hydro, and solar, are indeed efficiient, affordable, and cleaner than nuclear. I went on to make the ddo community further aware of the possibility of magnetic energy. While still in it's infancy, should magnetic energy blossom, everyone, everyone could benefit from this discovery. Yes it is a monetary threat to the Haliburtons of the world, yet they too could prosper by among the first to expand this invention. Conclusion. My opponent outlined the merits of nuclear energy and attempted to minimize the effects of it's toxic waste. I have demonstrated viable alternatives.

nuclear energy,"thank you for this debate my good man. definitions: Nuclear power source: nuclear power plant, C1 - Location - One cannot account nor predetermine what kind of weather patterns will change due to global warming. Location is the biggest issue with a nuclear power plant. You can't place it anywhere where there is a high risk place like natural disasters (earthquakes, hurricanes, etc.). The power plant cannot be placed in any urban area due one simply needs to see japan to now why or Chernobyl but even then a spill can contaminate for miles in any direction. Furthermore We are still fighting a ""war on terror"" this makes nuclear power plant high risk. So the power plant cannot be built anywhere in the coasts or near faults or in high density areas that leaves the rural areas however it cannot be placed there either because if there is a spill the people there loose their source of income and maybe thier lives due to human error. C2 -cost- nuclear power plant construction costs—mainly materials, labor, and engineering—rose by 185 percent between 2000 and 2007. More recently, costs have been increasing even faster: In mid-March, Progress Energy informed state regulators that the twin 1,100 MW nuclear plants it intends to build in Florida would cost $14 billion, which ""triples estimates the utility offered little more than a year ago."" Jim Harding, former director of power planning and forecasting for Seattle City Light, estimates that nuclear plants constructed today would provide electricity at between 12 and 17 cents per kilowatt-hour. To put this cost into perspective, the average U.S. electricity price in 2006 was 8.9 cents per kWh, and well-placed wind turbines can produce electricity for less than 5 cents per kWh. So nuclear power actally costs more than wind or water power. C3 - investment - Subsidies for nuclear reactors wouldn't subsidize nuclear technology—they would subsidize the nuclear industry. Congress should fund research of clean, alternative energy technologies that promise to rival fossil fuels in cost—without subsidies. Congress should also provide tax credits that would make such technologies cheaper by encouraging production and moving them down the experience curve. Such support would encourage a growing American industry and create American jobs. By squandering our limited resources on subsidies for the nuclear power industry, the United States is missing an extraordinary opportunity. C4 - Waste - Where is all the waste going to go? nuclear power generates toxic waste never mind that america hasn't really built one in over thirty years and never mind that japan steel is the only company which produces the central part of a nuclear reactor containment vessel. All the waste generated by uranium/plutonium ( and we don't have vry much uranium so availability is also a problem) will go in big containers and be buried in the earth which is sort of ironic because nuclear energy is supposedly clean. Conclusion: The united states federal gov't should not invest in nuclear power sources because of lack of understanding nuclear power plants, there is no viable location of where to put nuclear reactors, They would be high risk targets for terrorists, an investment in them would not be wise, and there would be a generation of waste and the availability of uranium is another problem as well.

nuclear energy,"I thank my opponent for his response. I would like to bring to my opponent’s attention that I will be leaving town Sunday and will not be able to continue this debate after that, so I hope that my opponent will be hasty in his responses so that this debate may conclude before then. My opponent’s first contention is that there are no suitable locations for nuclear power plants to be constructed. However, my opponent fails to realize several things. Firstly, regulations at both the state and federal level mean that nuclear power plants constructed in the United States are among the safest, most secure in the world. The plants are very resilient to natural disasters. For example, in the wake of Fukushima nuclear disaster several safety concerns were raised over U.S. nuclear facilities. One such plant was the Callaway Nuclear Plant near Fulton, Missouri which is located less than 500 miles away than one of the most active fault lines in North America: the New Madrid Fault. In the event that an earthquake caused damage to the facilities at Callaway there are several safety measures that could be activated to avert disaster, including: -Billions of gallons of fresh water from the Missouri River (which is located only a few miles away) could be pumped into the reactors to cool them -Backup diesel generators would supply emergency power, meaning that water could continue to be pumped into the reactors even if the plant had to be powered-down -The plant is capable of being powered down completely in several ways -Equipment at the Callaway site would detect any major, seismic activity and immediately power down the plant [1] In response to my opponent’s claim that U.S. nuclear facilities would be targets of terrorist activity, I will have to agree with him. Radical, Islamic terrorists would love to cause just a partial meltdown at a nuclear power plant near a major American city. However, once again precautions already in place would prevent such from happening. U.S. nuclear facilities are very secure in the sense that they have a 24-hour security presence and semi-restricted airspace exists around all U.S. nuclear facilities. In the post 9/11 world, the notion that anybody with malicious intentions could gain access to an American nuclear facility is simply speculative and unsubstantiated. As it is clear to see, the safety precautions at U.S. nuclear power sites help safeguard them from natural and man made disasters. By opponent’s second point of contention is that nuclear power plant’s require a large amount of monetary investment in the form of licensing and construction costs. However, I have some points that I would like to bring up in refutation of his argument. Firstly, one of the main goals of extra government investment into nuclear power would be the reduction of start-up costs. More government investment could lead to the formation of new, less costly construction techniques that would consequently increase the feasibility of nuclear power plant construction. One method by which government could lower the costs of nuclear power would be removing two-hurdle licensing and encouraging uniform design. Two-hurdle licensing is method of licensing still used in some states that require a license be obtained in order to construct the plant and an additional license be acquired to actually operate the plant. In some instances, this delayed the dates of the plants’ planned openings by several years resulting in additional, unseen costs. The worst case scenario happened at the Shoreham Plant on Long Island which was constructed but never allowed to operate. It is estimated that this cost New York taxpayers over five billion dollars [2]. By streamlining, the licensing process the government could lower costs associated with nuclear development. Even still though, the government could go a step further and encourage uniform design. Currently, all U.S. nuclear power plants are highly specific and use unique, one-of-a-kind equipment. This increases costs because it costs extra money to develop all of the unique equipment required for nuclear power plant construction. Also, it lengthens the construction process because all of the unique equipment has to be inspected and approved by federal regulators. By using tax credits and tax waivers, the federal government and state governments could encourage uniform design. [2] In his third contention, my opponent claims that investment should be directed towards cleaner, “greener” sources of energy. My opponent has made a mistake. He has assumed that by “investment” I mean additional funding into nuclear power plant development. However, by reviewing the definitions posted in Round 1--one can clearly see that the term “investment” does not just mean money. One way in which to increase investment in nuclear power would be to streamline and simplify the licensing process--something that would not require any additional funding. Secondly, my opponent claims that it is foolish to invest in nuclear power when so many “better” energy sources exist. However, more careful examination reveals some alarming facts about the practicality of wind energy. Windmills are extremely large, yet produce very little electricity. If the fully operable windmills in California, Texas, Minnesota, Iowa, Washington and Oregon were to run and produce electricity, the amount produced would be equal to one-third of 1% of the electricity produced in the United States in one year [3]. In addition, these wind farms impair environmental, ecological, scenic and property values, for obvious reasons. The bulk of the windmills become an eyesore in many scenic areas, may affect bird migration, and potentially would adversely impact ecological rarities. In his fourth point, my opponent brings up the environmental concerns related to nuclear waste and the availability of uranium resources. I agree with my opponent in saying that the waste produced by nuclear power plants is a real concern and that uranium and plutonium are not infinite resources. However, the nuclear waste problem is one that has been solved for quite some time. Regulations by the EPA, the DoE require that nuclear waste be disposed in such a manner that keeps it safe for at least one million years [4]. Burying the waste underground is a sensible means of disposal as it reduces its environmental impact while keeping it safely away from the human population. Also, as advances in technology continue one option that may become available for nuclear disposal is that nuclear waste be launched into outer space. Imagine, our nuclear waste hundreds of light-years away! How is disposal in this manner not environmentally friendly. My opponent also makes a point about the availability of uranium and plutonium--these things are not infinite resources. However, recent studies by independent agencies seem to suggest that the world holds more radioactive material than one might think. In fact, we have not reached “peak uranium” and new uranium deposits are being discovered everyday [5]. Also, recycled radioactive material form nuclear waste and decommissioned nuclear weapons serves as a major source of nuclear energy. While estimates are somewhat arbitrary, scientists predict that enough uranium exists in the world to sustain nuclear energy for several hundred years [5]. I would also like to point out to my opponent that he supplied no sources and did not even challenge my contentions. Thus, at this point I can claim to win by default. [1]http://www.kmov.com...

nuclear energy,"I thank my opponent for his argument. I will quickly dive into mine now. 1) Effectiveness. My opponent has admitted to passing on the effectiveness argument, choosing to focus on different potential short comings. As to save space, I will leave this as is and also focus on the different potentail short comings. 2) Safety. With this, I will break this down into two subsections, technical safety (a), and political safety (b). a) Normally, we would dismiss the mentioning of TMI (Three Mile Island), Chernobyl, and Fukushima as cases of spotlighting fallacies rather than accurate representations of the technology. Such fallacies would be like saying cars should not be allowed because the Ford Pinto was unsafe. However, for any engineer, it is vital to learn from mistakes so that they cannot happen again (when there are actually mistakes). Just like they learned from the Pinto to make a better, safer car, we too can learn from these three incidents how to make a better reactor. So we will actually look at each of these individually, as well as the safety record in whole of nuclear reactors. Going by year, we will first look at TMI, 1979 [1][2]. This was an incident that started because a relief valve became stuck open, causing the cooling fluids to leave the reactor. This was compounded by the fact that an operator mistook the lack of cooling fluid as too much cooling fluid, thus opening more values to let more out. The reactor over heated and the core melted (refered to as a meltdown), however, the melted core never breached the containment walls and was cooled back down by the automated system (all people had evacuated by then). A follow up report, the Komeny report [3], showed that no one had died from the radation releases, and that the releases were of a quantity that they would not have any measurable effect on the people in ther area. What have we learned from TMI [4][5]? We learned many things from TMI that have allowed us to not have a repeat, even though the damage from TMI was actually rather minor (apart from damage to the reactor itself). From improved training, better communication, and better configuration of the control rooms to allow better understanding of issues and faster, more accurate reaction from personnel. Moving on to the next, Chernobyl, 1986 [6]. Chernobyl is a unique disaster, that given the secrecy of the USSR at the time (we didn't even know about the incident until we discovered radioactive material in the air in Sweden). Chernobyl was using an RBMK style reactor [7], which the US and most of the western world knew was unsafe because of the use of a void coefficient and their particular fuel rod set up. With the reactor styles we have now, a Chernobyl style incident is not physically possible, even if someone got into the reactor control and tried to make it happen [8]. The latest, Fukushima, 2011. Fukushima is most definiately a spotlight example. While most of the others we look at and say ""what went wrong,"" which Fukushima, we can look at and say ""Holy crude, why didn't more go wrong?"" Fukushima reactors were all over 30 years old, with some over 40 years old. They we hit by a 9.0 earth quake followed shortly by a 50 foot tsunami. Yet somehow, they managed to hold out (about as well as Rocky did in his first movie). While most of the reactors ended up melting down from a disaster that would cripple any structure in the world, they've done a fair job contianing that material. While some radiation does escape, just like some did at TMI, there are no recorded deaths from the radiation, either on the plant, nor in the general public. And from this, we've been able to learn where the reactor had issues, and how to improve upon them going forward. Since accidents are learning opportunities, to see what you may have overlooked and places to do better, they can actually be very helpful to us. And in cases where the accident has no serious harm to society, the minor accidents can be viewed as possitives, so that we can get better at preventing the big accidents that do cause serious harm. Now I will look at the safety risks of aggressive nations having nuclear energy. My opponent points out that nations, such as Iran and North Korea, will hide their nuclear facilities, and as a result, may cut corners with them. This is not a good argument against nuclear energy, since it is the very prohibition of the nuclear energy that is causing them to be unsafe. By opening up, showing them the safe ways and the unsafe ways, and even helping them build them it has many benefits. 1) Safer power plants 2) Better relations between nations 3) More energy for the nation to help people get out of poverty and build their economy 4) More power to the people to fight against dicatorships Since electricity is needed to clean water, power hospitals, develop medicenes, run industry, and provide heat and air conditioning for people, it is vital to bettering the lives of the people in those nations, and thus bettering the relation between them and us. 3) Costs To answer my opponent's question regarding why more energy isn't done by nuclear energy, I have two responces. First, this isn't really a legitimate question. One could easly through this question upon his suggested alternatives, that since solar makes up so little energy, it must not be effective. In reality, better ideas, always take time to replace the status quo, and simply because something is being used used more commonly does not mean that it is more effective. The second part of the answer is a lack of knowledge, combined with false knowledge. In regards to nuclear energy, it is often called the China Syndrome, in reference to a 1979 movie (which came out only months before TMI), that showed nuclear reactors as bombs just waiting to go off. Since more people get their views from hollywood than from sciencewood, they are going to have opinions based on incorrect knowledge. While many African and Latin American nations are not wealthy enough to produce nuclear, by us generating more nuclear, that cuts the demand for natural gas and coal (and other fuels). This drop in demand, turns into a drop in cost of those materials, and the drop in cost will help the people in those poorer nations. Moving on to the alternatives that my opponent has listed, I will quickly address them one by one (1,500 characters left, sorry). Hydro - Hydro is limited by rivers, while many nations do have a lot of rivers, many do not, and so hydro is not adequate for them. Hydro also takes much longer to build, as it develops the entire ecosystem around it (turning a river into a lake). Solar - While solar is my ultimate energy fav, it too has its limits. Many northern nations are going to find solar to be less than ideal. Even here in Oregon, we find that it is only the edge. As only getting 5 sun hours a day (on average over a year), one would need 4,800 MW solar field to equal the same as a single 1,000 MW nuclear (or coal, or natural gas, or anything that can run 24 hours a day). Move up into Canada or other northern nations, and that can stretch into 8,000 MW of solar to match the single 1,000 MW of nuclear. Wind - similar to solar. Kenetic - The generators that are listed are standard fuel generators. I'm not sure what Kenetic Generators are and could not find them on a quick search. But those that you listed, show that the 15 kW model uses 1.36gal/hr. It doesn't say what the fuel is, but if it takes 1.36 gal to make 15 kW of energy, or 1 gal to make 11.03 kW, the fuel has to cost about $1.10 per gallon to be comparible. And even then, these only have 5 year warrenties, and so would need to be replaced and repaired more often [9].

nuclear energy,"I thank my opponent for a very enjoyable debate and look forward to more in the future. In this final round, I will go ahead and first, address my opponent's round 3 arguments, and second, post a summary. 2) Safety. While the three accidents are worthy of mention, they do not provide logically reason to support that nuclear energy is unsafe, anymore so than arguing that the Ford Pinto supports that cars in general are unsafe. If anything, they show of individual cases where safety was comprimised due to design issues (as with the pinto), nature, or human error. And I did refer to each of these individually in the last round to show how we learned from them to help us make sure that they never repeat (just like we learned from the design flaws of the pinto to make sure we never make something like it again). Regarding the safe transport of nuclear waste, I encourage everyone to watch at least the first 45 seconds of the attached video [video]. Nuclear waste transportation is tested and tested and tested. There are not many things which are tested to the point where they are strapped to a rocket powered semi truck and rammed into a concrete wall to see if they stay intact. Going on to the safety of storing, remember that if we reporcess nuclear waste (as many other countries do), the waste will not have any actinides (like Pu239, U235, or U238, or Th232 and U233 in the Thorium cycle), making it much safer. To the point where you only need minimal protective gear (Enriched uranium can be handled by only a latex glove covered hands, it is the Pu239 in the un-processed waste that requires the full suits and robots). 3) Cost Cost has been shown that it is cheaper to run (once built) than all current fossil fuel power sources, and it is cheaper than all alternative energy sources in start up costs (with the exception of dams, however, their restriction of having to be on rivers makes their use limited, and unable to be a primary powersource for a large nation). My opponent has also stated that the cost would be too great for some poorer nations. This doesn't really make sense. Many people can't afford a Porche, does that mean no one should be allowed to have one? I've already shown that by having wealthy nations switch over to nuclear, that will free up some supply of coal and natural gas, which will bring the price down on those, and thus make them cheaper for the poorer nations and ultimately help them and their economy, as an indirect result of nuclear energy. Regarding the magentic generators, anyone and everyone should be instantly skeptical of anything that promises free fueless energy. Most of these claim to be based from ""the lost Tesla Generator"" which Tesla didn't view as practical and never rebuilt them after his wearhouse burnt down (while he did rebuild other inventions). Most of these are no more real than that Nigerian Prince wanting to give away some of his money, the same is true for all perpetual motion devices. Regarding the quote from Arthur Schopenhauer, such a saying is known as Galieo's gambit, a logical fallacy. While it is true that many ""truths"" are first laughed at, not everything that is laughed at is a ""truth."" Moving on to my closing summary. I have shown that the effectiveness of nuclear energy far surpasses that of any other power source, both in quantity of power, and in the locations it can be used. These went pretty much entirely unchallenged. For safety, the main concerns where several spotlighted examples, all of which were addressed in my round 3 and were not challenged in my opponent's round 3. For cost, we can see that nuclear energy has a higher start up cost, but much lower fuel cost, meaning that over the long run, it costs much less. And this will allow other nations to obtain other fuels at lower prices. Regarding the opponent's arguments on various alternatives, those were all addressed and none of the addresses countered (though the magnetic generators was explained in greater detail and was only addressed in this round, so my opponent can counter the address in his next round). With that, I end my rounds of this debate and await my opponent's closing round. Again, thank you for the debate. http://www.youtube.com...",PRO,"Going on to the safety of storing, remember that if we reporcess nuclear waste (as many other countries do), the waste will not have any actinides (like Pu239, U235, or U238, or Th232 and U233 in the Thorium cycle), making it",528,"['0.2590428352355957', '0.7409571647644043']",0.2590428352355957,0.7409571647644043
nuclear energy,"Let's consider Pro's round two arguments in favor of nuclear energy: Amount The first of these is the amount of fuel available, and how long it could potentially last. The figures quoted here are so rubbery and based on speculation as to be pretty well meaningless. We are told that based on current consumption rates and current known supplies there is around 230 years worth of material remaining. This is fair enough. Then, we are told that using other sources of uranium, and other radioactive elements and isotopes that are not currently in use, and fission technologies that are not yet in production, the figure ""could"" be raised to thirty thousand years. That's a massive jump, and a lot of ""ifs"". Finally, Pro makes the claim that ""it may be so that, at current energy consumption, we could sustain ourselves for 1 million years on nuclear fission reactions alone."" This is a quantum leap from the thirty thousand quoted in the referenced article, and the source is not quoted. Pro, could you please provide the source of this claim? Pro closes his argument by stating ""Nuclear energy clearly has much greater reserves than fossil fuels, and energy that is always available, unlike renewables"". Unlike the elastic figures and speculation about future technologies used by the nuclear industry to estimate there may be around 30,000 years worth of atomic fuel left, we know for certain that ""The sun runs out of hydrogen fuel in its core about five billion years from now""[1]. Furthermore, since winds are caused by heating of the Earth by the sun, we know for certain without any speculation that there is five billion years worth of renewable energy left, regardless of how much is used. Efficiency According to Pro, ""Nuclear energy is cheaper and more efficient that other forms of energy, as it has a greater capacity factor and lower per unit energy costs than than other forms of energy, both fossil fuels and renewable."" This argument is just not true, as typically, figures quoted by nuclear energy producers look only at ongoing production costs, and ignore massive initial setup costs - for example $10 billion to construct a reactor, and clean up costs of up to hundreds of billions of dollars (as discussed in my round two argument) when something goes wrong. ""Cheap"" atomic energy is based largely on massive subsidies: ""Despite more than $150 billion in federal subsides over the past 60 years (roughly 30 times more than solar, wind and other renewable energy sources have received), nuclear power still costs substantially more than electricity made from wind, coal, oil or natural gas. This is mainly due to the cost of borrowing money for the decade or more it takes to get a nuclear plant up and running.""[2] Furthermore, private sector investors recognize that nuclear is not an economically viable energy option for the future: ""Nowhere [in the world] do market-driven utilities buy, or private investors finance, new nuclear plants."" Only continued massive government intervention is keeping the nuclear option alive.""[2] In summary, as Time Magazine eloquently puts it: ""private capital still considers atomic energy radioactive, gravitating instead toward natural gas and renewables, whose costs are dropping fast. Nuclear power is expanding only in places where taxpayers and ratepayers can be compelled to foot the bill.""[3] Environment This is where the pro nuclear lobby have to stretch the furthest. According to Pro, ""Nuclear energy actually has very little effect on the environment"". Perhaps Pro should try convincing the Navajo people, whose lands were used for uranium mining from 1944 til 1986, of that. It is no coincidence that ""Risk of lung cancer among male Navajo uranium miners was 28 times higher than in Navajo men who never mined""[4]. In addition, ""Rates of birth defects in babies born to Navajo women living in uranium mining areas in New Mexico and Arizona between 1964 and 1981 were 2 to 8 times the national averages, depending on the type of defect.""[4] Or perhaps he should try convincing the Scottish farmers of the ""minimal"" environmental impact of nuclear power generation: ""The direct consequences of the accident [Chernobyl] were felt in Scotland until 2010 when the last of the agricultural restrictions put in place following the catastrophe were lifted"".[5] But it isn't over yet. Even today, 28 years after Chernobyl, ""the country could still face contamination from the world's worst nuclear accident if the 1,600-mile exclusion zone around the now defunct power plant goes up in flames. The forests have been allowed to grow wild and unmanaged since the tragedy almost three decades ago and have continued to absorb contamination still evident in the area. Raising temperatures and lack of rain have now created a serious risk of a massive blaze, which could rage on for several days and have far-reaching consequences. Lack of resources mean spotting and putting out flames before they burn out of control is near impossible although a core group of volunteers is trying to do their best. Scientists in Scotland agree the prospect of redistribution of contaminated particles is ""very real""""[5]. The radioactive half life of products used in nuclear power generation ranges from tens of years to millions of years. Radioactive products which are left laying on the ground (tailings), or buried under the ground or ocean leave an environmental legacy that could last well beyond the life expectancy of the human race. And now I'd like to consider some additional arguments raised by Pro in round three: Firstly, we have this rather odd statement: ""The only real consideration for nuclear waste is the radioactivity and the potential threat to life that it creates. However, the considerations are not important"". Hopefully, this represents an unfortunate choice of words, and not really a total disregard of the many tens of thousands who have already died or will die as a result of accidents which have already occurred in the nuclear industry. Concerning storage of nuclear by products, various solutions are being explored globally; but no permanent solutions have been implemented. One pro-nuclear source admits: ""Currently, no country has a complete system for storing high level waste permanently"".[6] Regarding transportation of nuclear waste, Pro states that ""elaborate packaging"" reduces the chance of a catastrophe to almost none. It would be interesting to see the ""probabilistic risk analysis"" on which these figures were based, but it is not essential, because the argument ignores the most significant factor - the potential for terrorism. As I pointed out in round two, this month has seen the first recorded instance of a deliberate attack on a nuclear reactor. Particularly with the increasing use of drone technology, the potential for an attack on radioactive materials during transport is a very real, and very frightening possibility. And no amount of ""elaborate packaging"" will be effective against a missile attack. The remaining arguments from Pro in this round seem to be, in the main, denials of plain facts on the dangers of radioactivity from the nuclear industry. For example: - ""Miners of radioactive materials are actually much safer than are popularly believed"". - ""As for genetic mutations, again, while the risk is there, the dangers and probabilities of receiving any adverse effects are small."" - ""As for nuclear disasters, these are actually very rare"" - "" "" core melting and containment failure "" can cause few if any deaths to the public, regardless of the scenario that led to the core melt and containment failure."" All of these claims are contradicted by facts that I have raised in round two. Rather than refute them again here, I will refer to them in the last round when I summarise our respective cases. And finally, on the subject of economic viability, Pro cites an article by the Nuclear Energy Institute in saying: "" ""Analysis shows that every dollar spent by the average nuclear plant results in the creation of $1.04 in the local community, $1.18 in the state economy and $1.87 in the U.S. economy."" A big cost equals an even bigger gain"". Again, this claim by a major interest group is simply smoke and mirrors. It refers to the yearly ""economic output"" from a typical nuclear power generator, and claims it to be in the order of $470 million dollars per year. Yet what is not factored into this is the cost to construct the reactor in the first place. Even allowing for only $8 billion dollars which is claimed in the article, this gives an interest bill alone (at a modest 5%) of over $400 million dollars per year, which virtually wipes out all profits made. In comparison to this, renewable energy sources have negligible construction costs and vastly lower operating costs. References: [1] http://ds9.ssl.berkeley.edu...

nuclear energy,"Same format as above: 1a) Obviously wind farms take up much land, but the U.S has excessive land that we do not use mostly in the desert where there are plenty of wind. http://hubpages.com... Solar power plants work 24/7 even in cloudy conditions. http://www.grist.org... Building a nuclear power plant cost at least $4 billion, it is more costly to the 130 million for wind turbines that can be decommissioned or moved around. At least there methods do not deplete any resources, unlike nuclear. 1b) A serious nuclear accident would involved deaths and a major change in the surrounding enviroment. There is a 16% chance of a nuclear disaster within the next 40 years. (http://docs.google.com...) Space shuttles like Discovery were expected to have an accident every 76 flights. Instead, in less than 24 flights there were 2 accidents. Considering the fact nuclear power plants are built near cities, chances are nuclear accidents will cause devastating damage to the city. The majority of the cost of the accident will come from taxpayers. Other accidents:(http://www.lutins.org...) 2) Pro agrees because there were no arguments there. 3) Recycling is more expensive than obtaining newly mined uranium. So obviously nuclear companies would mine new sources and enrich nuclear. Metal is recycled more efficiently and economically cheaper than uranium. Not only that but wind turbines can be moved, unlike nuclear power plants. ""Reprocessing doesn't make any sense – economically, it's more expensive"" than mining uranium and just discarding the waste, claims Steve Caldwell, Policy Coordinator for the Pew Center on Global Climate Change. http://news.cnet.com... 4) Dave ignored the fact that the U.S has excess deserted land that can be filled with wind turbines, solar panels, and solar power plants. Con's case: 1) Over $96 billion per site. Considering we have many that also has to be maintained over tens of thousands of years and with inflation, so that's over $96 billion. http://www.usatoday.com... 2) Decommissioning a power plant just stripping the nuclear substance cost $320 million per unit. Compare this cost to simply moving solar panels or wind turbines by flatbed trucks. 3) Read my R2 and R3 sources. There were smuggling attempts while transporting uranium. In Russia in 1999 plant workers tried to sell 5 grams of radioactive material to the open market. Several years before some others were caught selling 4.5 kilograms of enriched uranium. http://www.atomicarchive.com... 4) One, ""The European Commission said in 2001 that at the current level of uranium consumption, known uranium resources would last 42 years. When added to military and secondary sources, the resources could be stretched to 72 years. Yet this rate of usage assumes that nuclear power continues to provide only a fraction of the world's energy supply. If electric capacity were increased six-fold, then the 72-year supply would last just 12 years."" Two, recycling is currently under experiments and very expensive. Plutonium 239 is a highly unstable byproduct of recycling and also increases the risk of an accident. I'm surprised that none had sunk yet; if one did it will contaminate the ocean, like oil. Actually, there was a solution about sinking waste but any rupture, even from one canister, would cause serious major environmental damage. So with that said nuclear energy should not be the primary alternative energy. Voting issues: 1) Davewerty dropped my 2nd rebuttal on his case about high security standards not being able to protect the environment. 2) Davewerty did not have valid sources backing is arguments. Note to Davewerty: always post sources. 3) Nuclear accidents are likely to happen/increase if we increase our use, proven above. 4) In the long run nuclear energy are more expensive than any other alternative sources. 5) U.S has excess desert land that no one live on and are promising to solar and wind power, we should invest more in those instead, basically went in a circle about how alternative energy takes up land and money. 6) Nuclear recycling is currently unstable and expensive so it is not as economical and eco-friendly as other alternatives. 7) Nuclear waste is still a major issue, recycling is not a reliable option. 8) Increase in nuclear energy would increase the chances of smuggling nuclear for ""other purposes.""

donald trump,"Who is this man ""Trump."" There have been several articles posted on the internet lately that suggest that Donald Trump isn't who he is portraying himself to be, as real conservative republican. In a REDSTATE ARTICLE for instance the author of the article states,""The Bible says not to put new Christians in leadership positions. I don""t think the conservative movement should put new conservatives in leadership positions either. Let them be sure what they believe first."" In the same article its stated that Donald Trump has been a contributor to the democrat party and organizations that conservatives were against so that certainly raises the question about who Donald trump reallty is Some have suggested that Donald trump is a spoiler taking away votes that could have gone to another republican candidate running for president who is a more known conservative ruining the republicans chances of winning the White House. Donald Trump covers himself by saying that he was a businessman and as such, he gave money to a lot of different causes and people, that was the way business was done. Isn't the reason that Donald Trump is gaining so much support is because the conservatives and republicans in general are becoming fed up with the way the ""Good old boys, ""/ Establishment republicans, and establishment democrats, have been doing business as usual in Washington. Maybe though the Conservative republicans think that those who have been elected to office weren't listening to conservatives and independents and haven't been for a long time and are now willing to take a chance that Donald Trump will listen to them and will promote the things that conservatives believed in. Betting on Donald Trump to be the conservatives and independents friend is a gamble, only time will tell whether the gamble paided off,if Donald trump actually believed in what he said that he believed in. Donald Trump is saying what conservatives and independents wanted to hear, but is it a businessman just doing business and saying what he thinks will sell, again, only time will provide the answer, we can only hope that Donald Trump doesn't turn out to be a spoiler and allow Hillary or some other democrat to be elected to office.

donald trump,"NoorH606, You made several valid points which are as follows: 1) Donald Trump said that ""Muslims are TERRORISTS and Mexicans are RAPISTS"", 2) Donald Trump criticizes people, and 3) Donald Trump will deport all the Mexicans. These claims are undeniably true. However, they're also illogical. When Donald Trump said that Muslims are terrorists and Mexicans are rapists, it was easy to feel that he was racist and anti-Islam. This is absolutely untrue. Donald Trump said during a rally ""I have many Muslim friends who approve of what I'm doing."" Donald Trump Is not anti-Islam. We all know that not all Muslims are terrorists. However, it is important to note that most terrorists are (or claim to be) Muslim! Islam is a peaceful religion, but why is it that it is the ONLY religion that is twisted into such a cult of death? Why is it that whenever Muslims are around a people of another religion, conflict occurs? It's also common knowledge that Illegal Mexicans in the US rape. That's an undeniable fact, but I'll get back to this issue later. You also mentioned that Donald Trump criticizes people. He criticizes people. He's in the Presidential race. Isn't it a given that Donald Trump should criticize people? Finally, you mentioned that Donald Trump would deport the Illegal Mexican immigrants. What's wrong with that? Isn't that a thing that a president (or a person running for president) should do? Think of it this way: We have a picket-fence at the border. People wanting to cross that fence will just jump over it. Most of the time, those people are not coming to escape oppression, though there are a few that genuinely are. The majority of those people will bring in drugs, or rape, or get government benifits for free (a.k.a. Bankrupting our economy). We get the drugs, rape and bad economy, and they get the cash. That's not a good deal. Before I go on to the pros of Donald Trump, I would like to debunk a few Donald Trump myths. 1-Donald Trump is anti-immigration. He is not. In fact, the one strongest argument for this claim is also the same as the one used for the other side. I'm speaking of the wall. The wall that Mexico will pay for. Donald Trump is not anti-immigration. The point of the wall isn't to show the world that the US doesn't want people coming into it; rather, it is a statement that coming in legally will be EASIER than coming in the other way. Donald Trump Himself said ""We'll build the wall, but it will have huge, beautiful door."" Thus, the claim that Donald Trump is anti-immigration does not have any supporting evidence. 2-Donald Trump is a liar because he supported many of the people he now opposes while he was a businessman. The fact that Donald Trump was a businessman meant that he had to be friends with people with power, whether or not he agreed with them politically. Now that Donald Trump is running for president, his priorities have changed monumentally. His goal now isn't to make money, but to better the lives of the American People Now that the myths are out of the way, I'd like to outline why I think Donald Trump would be a good president. 1-He speaks his mind. Ironically, this is the reason that many people dislike him. However, the fact that he isn't afraid to speak his mind is a sign that when he becomes the Pres., he won't change his mind. 2-He knows how to make good deals. He spent his life making good deals for him. Just look around. Look at all the buildings with the name ""Trump""- Trump Tower, Trump Palace, etc. There's no reason to suspect that he would suddenly become bad at getting his way when faced with leaders of foreign countries. 3-He's good with money. Much of my evidence in the previous point applies to this. Donald Trump knows how to deal with money. He spent his life proving that! Those are a few of the reasons why I think you are wrong about Donald Trump, and why I am right.",PRO,"However, they're also illogical. ...

Especially when labeling one as a racist, A word that carries weight when factually and undeniably proved. Simplified I believe an accusation or allegation needs in my opinion substance, Credibility, And truthful intent. When an accusation or allegation is lacking and/ or is dis-aligned within these things it loses its ability to hold or grasp at a factual status. I would like to hear your opinion on this as it will apply to this debate. 1. This is a line from John R. O'Donnell's book, ""Trumped! "" This is not a direct quote. In fact, All of O'Donnell's book is simply a recollection of what he thinks Trump said. 2. The whole narrative of this quote was to shed light on the atrocities ILLEGAL immigrants have been committing. I'm going to assume for respect's sake that you didn't twist this quote intentionally. In your point you write, ""They're rapists"" when the real quote is, ""Their rapists. "" If he really meant to label all Mexicans then he wouldn't have said, ""and some I assume are good people. "" Which came right after where you left off his quote. 3. The Trump Organization, Fred Trump, And Donald Trump were sued. While reading your points it seems that convenient context is being removed from these situations to paint Donald Trump a racist. I'd like to point out that this case was settled with an agreement to give a group of civil-right's activists priority in housing with Trump Management emphasizing no admission of guilt. I'd also like to point out that all forty-three of the African-Americans accusers of the Trump Organization didn't hold Donald Trump at any fault. Lastly, No evidence was uncovered that Donald Trump created or carried out discriminatory policies. 4. I cannot find anything on the Trump Organization, Fred Trump, Or Donald Trump being sued in 1976 for refusing to rent to people of color. A further explanation of this point would be helpful. 5. I fail to see why this is a point in your argument. Donald Trump spent $85, 000 rolling out an ad campaign calling for the death penalty of these teenagers while firmly believing they were the perpetrators. The police through coercion convinced the teenagers to confess to this crime. Thing is, Unbeknownst to the coercion Donald Trump made this decision; moreover, I personally don't agree with his stance on this issue (even though I can see why he holds this view) but in no way is his view and stance on this issue racist. In no light can one find Donald Trump making this case into anything racial. 6. Absolutely not. Yes, Donald Trump still believes the five are guilty for the rape but he has not in any way shape or form connected race into his stance. Saying he believes they are guilty due to their color is downright outrageous and unfounded. 7. We encounter my issue with accusations and allegations. I find this point lacking substance. Simply put, All the substance of this allegation is a former employee alleging that blacks were ordered off the floor when Trump and Ivana came in. That's it. There is no evidence of this happening nor others speaking out on its behalf that I can find. I couldn't find Trump addressing this allegation anywhere either. 8. Once again cannot find anything on this. Please explain and present detailed evidence of these situations. 9. I'm assuming your point is talking about the CNN State of Union show. Donald Trump after being asked to disavow David Duke responded by saying, ""Well, Just so you understand, I don""t know anything about David Duke, OK? I don""t know anything about what you""re even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists, I know nothing about David Duke. I know nothing about white supremacists. "" He went on to say he needed to do research before he disavows anything or anyone. Thing is, Later during the Republican debates in 2016 Donald Trump DID in fact disavow David Duke and the KKK. 10. Same situation as your first point. If you would like to press these two points more, Then I feel our debate will partly lie in the threshold of authenticity regarding accusations. There is a bit to unpack here. I hope I have understood and replied well to your points and am looking forward to your response.",CON,"If he really meant to label all Mexicans then he wouldn't have said, ""and some I assume are good people.

donald trump,"1973 Racial Bias Lawsuit Actually, that's only partially true. Donald Trump himself was not sued, Trump Management Inc. was. At that time, as stated by your source, Trump was only an apprentice - his father, Fred Trump, was in charge. This means that any accusations of racism within the company would be attributed to Fred Trump. The title of your source (a liberal-leaning source, however, I'm completely okay with that) is very misleading and even contradicts information that later appears in the title. ""Inside the government""s racial bias case against Donald Trump""s company, and how he fought it"". Well yes, it's Donald Trump's company today, but in 1973 it was owned by Fred Trump; of course Donald will be loyal and defend his father, and of course he will testify in court for him, but to hold Donald Trump entirely accountable is downright false. A better title would be: ""Inside the government's racial bias case against Fred Trump's company, and how Donald Trump defended his father."" On top of that, you didn't provide any evidence that Trump was aware of any racism in his father's company, considering he was just an apprentice at the time. 2. Obama Birth Certificate I'm not so sure about that. Barack Obama was not the only African-American to run for president while Trump was alive. Shirley Chrisholm ran in 1972 - Trump did not ask for a birth certificate. Jesse Jackson ran in 1984 and 1988 - Trump did not ask for a birth certificate. Lenora Fulani ran in 1988 and 1992 - Trump did not ask for a birth certificate. Alan Keyes ran in 1996 and 2000 - Trump did not ask for a birth certificate. Carol Moseley Braun ran in 2004 - Trump did not ask for a birth certificate. Al Sharpton ran in 2004 - Trump did not ask for a birth certificate. Ben Carson ran in 2016, against Donald Trump himself - Trump did not ask for a birth certificate. The reason Trump was suspicious about the birth certificate was because of Obama's ties to Indonesia and Kenya. I think it's a little absurd, but it's not fueled by 'xenophobia' and 'racism'. 3. Presidential Campaign Controversies You claimed that ""Trump's anti-immigration campaign is [racist["". Actually, Donald Trump is pro-immigration and against only illegal immigration. Even though illegal immigration is a minor crime, it is a crime nonetheless - hence the word 'illegal'. We can't turn a blind eye to it, especially when 3 million arrests have been attributed to an undocumented population of only 11 million - and yes, Trump cites this statistic on his website and links to a source. Saying that he is blindly accusing illegal immigrants of crime is false. 4. Gonzalo Curiel Gonzalo Curiel is part of an society called La Raza Lawyers, which ""promotes the interests of Latino communities throughout the state."" The comment Trump made, as he clarified in the interview featured on your source, referred to this rather than referring solely to his Mexican heritage. The idea that someone will be biased against you if they are part of a group that dislikes you is not extreme at all. In my opinion, Trump's comments were fine and not racist. 5. Muslims You're right, Islam is a religion, not a race. That being said, I'll discuss your argument anyway. First of all, he only wants to have a Muslim database for refugees, not Muslim citizens. It says that very clearly in the Politifact source you used. Secondly, he did not suggest that ""Muslims should have to carry around specials IDs"" in your second source, it only says that he did not rule it out at the time, and by the looks of it, he has ruled it out now. Finally, in your third source, he says that perhaps we should start thinking about profiling Muslims, not that he supports it. In fact, he said he is hesitant about profiling in that same source, though he said we should not yet rule it out. He has not gone any further with it, however. 6. KKK Supports Trump They also endorsed Hillary. William Quigg, a grand dragon in California, pledged his allegiance to her and the Klan donated $20,000 to her campaign. Does that mean we can interpret her policies as racist now? Donald Trump is NOT a racist.

donald trump,"Although I do agree with your stance on Donald Trumps economic benefits, he has no sense of humanity. A POTUS must have the ability to connect and relate to the people of The United States of America, regardless on age, race, gender or ability. The fact that Donald Trump has already caused protests, including the organisation of the woman's march further proves that Donald Trump is far too incompetent to run the largest economic country in the world. Furthermore, the POTUS must act as a role model for all citizens, regardless on whether it is apart of the job description, it is crucial that he promotes equality and kindness.
