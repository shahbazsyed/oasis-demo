climate change,"Global Warming (or climate change in the hot way) is the thing. It is a win or lose election debate topic. It is also very contested in the public field (media). The IPCC states that it exists and that it is human induced. State intervention is often motivated by climate change concerns. However there are many scientists, people and companies that contest climate change or human induced climate change. They have interesting arguments. I believe that they are mistaken. I define human global warming as the abnormal and significant increase of mean global temperatures caused (in part) by human activity. I expect to win if i can show that 1 climate change (in the sense of global warming) exists 2 it is caused in a significant degree by human activity I consider that my opponent wins if he/she is able to negate either of the above. I will affirm 3 arguments to sustain my position: science cvasi-consensus, observable events in the world around us, mental experiment. At this moment there is near consensus between scientists that global warming exists and is human induced[1]. The scientific model is quite simple to understand and makes sense. It is clear that the weather is influenced by many factors, and some are more powerful than others. The greenhouse effect is a powerful factor as shown by the super greenhouse effect on Venus. [2] Green house gases have increased at the highest level in the last 650 000 years after the industrial revolution. [3] To bring the scientific argument down to the human level and to avoid an authority argument i will point out that ice caps are already melting, the first drowned polar bears were found, more violent weather is happening etc. What is more, the arctic ice shows an increase in carbon concentration and temperature.[4] The mental experiment part is more complex in the sense that it involves the concept of positive feed-back. The oceans trap carbon while they are cold, when they heat up they release carbon. This a positive feed-back loop and it means that things will only get worse.[5] . Humans have reached a level where they can affect the climate. Acid rains and other city related weather are examples of humans influencing weather. In conclusion, from the scientific, factual and mental experiment arguments I conclude that global warming exists and it is human induced. Looking forward for a good debate.

climate change,"A study by the biology cabinet shows no relationship between CO2 and temperature [1]. ""On this assessment, the evidence points to a current natural climate change which happens sequentially in two main climate periods, icehouse and warmhouse."" Another study was found on the Vostok ice cores, which show temperature records going back over 400,000 years. Data from the ice cores reveal an 800 year lag of CO2 behind temperature [2], meaning CO2 changes came AFTER temperature. If climate change was man made, then temperature would lag behind CO2, but the opposite happens, which proves that CO2 cannot influence temperature. The ice cores also show that the temperature rose to about the same level whenever it rose significantly, which shows that it is a constant cycle and not affected by human activities. The same can be said about the CO2 levels. Manipulation and False Activism Pollutes the Climate Change Debate One of the biggest science scandals, Climategate, occurred in 2009. Hackers stole emails from scientists at the East Angelia Climatic Research Unit, and statements from the emails contradict anthropogenic climate change. [3]. ""The fact is that we can't account for the lack of warming at the moment and it is a travesty that we can't... Our observing system is inadequate"" [4]. ""I've just completed Mike's Nature trick of adding in the real temps to each series for the last 20 years (ie from 1981 onwards) and from 1961 for Keith's to hide the decline."" [4]. The government as well as a variety of foundations donate billions of dollars to scientists to prove global warming is man made and to groups that put a megaphone to the global warming agenda. [5] ""the U.S. Government spent more than $32.5 billion on climate studies between 1989 and 2009. This doesn't count about $79 billion more spent for related climate change technology research, foreign aid and tax breaks for green energy.""- Forbes A report by the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works shows a ""billionaire's club"" that directs funding to leftist environmental activism groups and policy makers, while also getting grants from the government. [5] ""Under President Obama, EPA has given more than $27 million in taxpayer-funded grants to major environmental groups. Notably, the Natural Resources Defense Council and Environmental Defense Fund "" two key activists groups with significant ties to senior EPA officials "" have collected more than $1 million in funding each."" Finally, Former Vice President Al Gore made a famous movie called ""An Inconvenient Truth"" about the theory of man made global warming and its effects. However, there were eleven significant errors in his movie, coming from Gore trying to exaggerate in attempt to scare people into believing his political agenda. So what could be the cause of the global warming? I believe the sun is the one responsible, as correlations between the sun and the Earth's temperature have been found when studying temperature and sun levels from 1880-1980 [11], and 1980-2006 [12]. This could also explain why other planets in our solar system are warming, as all the planets rely on the Sun. But at the end of the day, the warming is NOT caused by CO2.

climate change,There is an overwhelming scientific consensus climate change presents a serious risk to the future of the Earth and to mankind. Many of the threats we face due to climate change are insidious and while with others the connection may not be noticed by the deniers. But they are real and serious. Among these are the spread of potentially lethal diseases such as that caused by the Zika virus. Other diseases formerly confined to the tropics will spread across North America and Europe. There is also overwhelming scientific consensus climate change is being caused by human activity. There are a limited number of circumstances under which free speech can be restricted. One of them is child pornography. The reason that can be banned with violating the 1st Amendment is the harm caused to children in the production of child porn is of such magnitude the normal means of combating bad speech-- more speech is not adequate or sufficient. The ignorance peddled by climate change deniers many of whom like child pornographers do so for greed. Those threatened most by the adverse effects of climate change are children. These will include teenagers sent to fight the increasing number of wars and conflicts which will likely occur. Yes the risk is too high to allow this ignorance to continue to be peddled.

climate change,"The first most obvious mistake my opponent made in their argument was a cherry-picking fallacy. A cherry-picking fallacy is defined as ""When only select evidence is presented in order to persuade the audience to accept a position, and evidence that would go against the position is withheld. The stronger the withheld evidence, the more fallacious the argument."" [8] As you can see, my opponent, in round 2, only offered evidence which suggests anthropogenic climate change is real, and did not offer any evidence that suggests climate change is due to some other reason. A scientific consensus exists on the reality of anthropogenic climate change. -Stupidape This argument is fallacious because it doesn't take into account direct evidence, and only is about the opinions of climate scientists, who are not infallible. I already pointed this out in my main arguments, but that wasn't meant to be a direct response to my opponent, but a rebuttal on the general claim. In addition, there is room for doubt as long as there is not 100% of climate scientists who agree on this matter, which is not the case. ""Man-made climate change has already claimed human lives and continues to do so..."" -Stupidape This appears to be a Non Sequitur fallacy. This is ""when the conclusion does not follow from the premises. In more informal reasoning, it can be when what is presented as evidence or reason is irrelevant or adds very little to support to the conclusion."" [9] The amount of deaths happened from a heat wave in France. Sudden hot weather in one country doesn't prove that there is global climate change, let alone that it is anthropogenic. In addition, the heat-related deaths in the United States since 2000 has been going down[10], which is odd if supposedly there is significant amounts of warming. But yes, if you look at the graph provided by the EPA there, each of the three spikes in deaths, one in 2000, one soon after 2005, and one soon after 2010, are each going down over time. If you were to draw a straight line representing the average, it would also be going down.

climate change,"Greetings and welcome to the debate. In this round, I will present my key reasons for believing that climate change is indeed real, And not a hoax, As certain political leaders have said. But first, We must define climate change. The official definition of climate change is: a change in global or regional climate patterns, In particular a change apparent from the mid to late 20th century onwards and attributed largely to the increased levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide produced by the use of fossil fuels. My first reason is that we have seen a huge increase in COS22; levels in the atmosphere, And this can be correlated with human industrial activity. In fact, Atmospheric COS22; levels are directly proportionate to human industrial activity. And, Increasing COS22; levels lead to a predictable rise in temperature. You may say that climates change anyway, And COS22; levels will fluctuate naturally, But it is no coincidence that it starts changing rapidly the moment humans figure out how to mine coal and burn fossil fuels. My second reason is that the Earth's temperature has risen by approximately 1""C since 1969. This might not seem like much, But in comparison to previous climate changes, It is vastly significant. Ocean temperatures have also risen by 0. 7""F, Killing a statistically significant proportion of the Great Barrier Reef. My final reason is that Arctic sea ice is shrinking, And polar bears may see the first iceless summer by 2050. So, We can conclude that climate change is indeed real, And not a hoax. I await my opponent's argument!",PRO,"The official definition of climate change is: a change in global or regional climate patterns, In particular a change apparent from the mid to late 20th century onwards and attributed largely to the increased levels of"

climate change,"According to The Center For Biological Diversity, the world’s climate is changing as a result of the burning of fossil fuels. The burning of fossil fuels creates carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide traps heat in the atmosphere, and this causes the world’s temperature to rise. This is likely to reduce the amount of arable land on Earth, and it will cause food prices to increase. Furthermore, climate change is likely to result in rising sea levels. There even are major cities that could be flooded. As the population increases, the production of fossil fuels will increase.

climate change,"The task at hand is to ""...contend that anthropogenic climate change is non-existent."" From a common definition anthropogenic means relating to, or resulting from the influence of human beings on nature. Then, from common usage ""climate change"" means a harmful rise in global temperature. This could be a difficult task. The earth's atmosphere is 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, 0.9% argon, and 0.1% trace gases including CO2.[1] Assume (for this paragraph only) that the small trace gas of CO2 (.04%) is the cause of global warming. The focus here will be upon sources of CO2 emissions both natural and manmade. The source emissions of CO2 would by a most rational people would be the cause of global warming. According to the IPCC 800 gigatons of CO2 is emitted into the atmosphere from nature and man, annually.[2] Most rational people would consider a source that is most than 51% to be the cause of a problem. Some irrational people might try to argue that 33% would be a threshold for cause. Only, crazy people would state that something that is less than 5% could be consider the cause. That brings us to the percent of total CO2 emissions from mankind. That percent of CO2 emissions is 3.62% (29 from man of 800 total gigatons)! [2] This 3.62% can not be the cause of global warming. Now, questioning if CO2 is the cause of global warming. The alarmist side uses thresholds in parts per million (PPM). 400 PPM sounds scary and 0.04% is at an insanely small amount, both numbers are the same. Imagine, how quick the alarmists arguments would be dismissed if they said that 0.04% of atmospheric gases drove global climate. Then if combined with only 3.6% of annual CO2 emissions is from man, this is an incredibly small number that man is responsible for. Using just common sense methods, it becomes very hard to believe claims made by alarmists. Anyone attempting to say 3.6% is the cause of a problem would be laughed at. Especially, when the gas in question is exhaled by each one of us. The real reasons for climate change to be anthropogenic is political and financial. Just federal grants for climate change related projects is greater than $10 billion.[3] Scientists are just as financially motivated as anyone else. A climate scientist that is outside of the mainstream will not be funded. This creates incentives to stay in agreement with those in political power. Anthropogenic climate change as a political is prefect for oppressive progressive politicians. The solutions to this false issue are more governmental control over the daily lives of harmless people. The politicians have scientist by the purse strings, this ensures compliance. This debate is about causes not effects, thus positive and negative impacts will not be addressed. 1. http://climate.ncsu.edu... 2. http://www.climatechange2013.org... 3. http://www.gao.gov...",CON,"This could be a difficult task. ...

climate change,"This is as close as the opponent comes to making an argument about cause: ""A scientific consensus exists on the reality of anthropogenic climate change. ' But there is a scientific consensus on the reality of anthropogenic climate change. Climate scientists have repeatedly tried to make this clear. It is time for the rest of us to listen.'[0]"" That is the only statement that is close to an argument about cause. Then the source basically states, science does not know, but what if. Then appeals to emotion by asking people to think about their grandchildren, thus action to reduce CO2 must be taken, you know just in case. The question could also be asked, what if the consensus is wrong? The alarmists are advocating for billions of people to reduce their living standards to keep the planet from maybe warming a few degrees. Looking at the analogy mostly used to explain green house effect, which is a green house. A few years ago I was in an empty plastic sheet green house on a sunny but very cold day. The very thin sheet of clear plastic raised the inside temperature significantly, but the owner was planning on disassembling within a few days. My question to the owner was ""would a second sheet of plastic make the green house warmer for longer?"" The owner looked at me and said ""it does not work that way"". There would be an insulation effect if there is a gap between the two sheets of plastic. Yet, this false consensus is asking us to believe that more CO2 equals higher global temperatures. From an idea that more plastic does not make a green house warmer to a question would more CO2 make the Earth warmer. There is research that suggests once there is enough CO2 to have a green house effect more will not cause higher temperatures[1]. This is outside the narrative and must be stopped. Government's need a reason for people to be scared so that controls can be forced on everyone. In summary, consensus is not science! Climate change has become like a religion for those that believe. Western civilization learned centuries ago that state and religion is best separated. Thus, policy changes based on climate change consensus should not be enacted by governments. 1. http://hockeyschtick.blogspot.com...",CON,"Then the source basically states, science does not know, but what if. ...

climate change,"The problem with your argument is humans have been wrong with a lot of ideas. I find most of your argument fits under the ad populum fallacy. [2] Just because the majority of scientists think man made climate change is real and a threat, does not mean the scientists are correct. At one time we thought the Earth was flat and the sun revolved around the Earth. "" ""Does the Earth go around the Sun, or does the Sun go around the Earth?"" If you answered the latter, you're among a quarter of Americans who also got it wrong, according to a new report by the National Science Foundation. "" [3] There is a chance that the entire global warming/climate change is a scam. That the deniers are whistle blowers. If we start jailing whistle blowers we could be in a lot of trouble. [4] Remember that 97% of climate change scientists agree. That means 3% don't, those 3% could be legitimate whistle blowers. Some of the scientist claim there is bullying going on to reach the consensuses. [5] There is talk of data manipulation. [6] Honestly, I will not stoop by backing up the deniers. I think the chances of the deniers being wrong is at least 99%. Nevertheless, there is that 1% chance. More importantly, it sets a precedence as seen in r1. Finally, and perhaps my strongest argument. Assume for a second that the deniers are wrong. Not much of an assumption. Jailing the deniers could backfire. Causing them to become martyrs per say.

feminism,"Greetings! Thank you for this debate, this should be fun! In accepting this debate I do not pretend to stand for all of feminism seeing as there are many different sects of the movement. I also do not claim to know everything about feminism. I will use sources from the internet as well as books to support my argument. First, we must define Feminism. There are many different types of feminism. For example: Antiporn feminism, Cultural Feminism, Hip Hop feminism, Lesbian Feminism, Queer feminism, and Radical feminism. The feminism it seems you disagree with is the one that is prevalent in the Pink Hat movement. But my stance will be from the Antiporn and Cultural Feminist movements. These movements advocate the reality: Women are more nurturing, cooperative, and communicative. Instead of measuring themselves against men, women should make their own activities more visible and valued. Want to do away with the dehumanization of women in pornography You say that feminism has ""gone too far,"" but before we can continue, give me more to chew on.",PRO,"Instead of measuring themselves against men, women should make their own activities more visible and valued. ...

feminism,"Con stated that that the Merriam-Webster dictionary is unreliable because it is biased. Con's reasoning for this was that the dictionary was made in ""liberal"" Massachusetts. Con has provided no evidence to support that it is made in Massachusetts, or how the location of the dictionary company proves that it is unreliable. Until Con proves this connection, my definition of Feminism still stands. Yet I will make it even more difficult for Con. Here are many more authoritative definitions of Feminism: Oxford Dictionary - ""The advocacy of women's rights on the ground of equality of the sexes"" [3] Cambridge Dictionary - ""The belief that women should be allowed the same rights, power, and opportunities as men"" [4] Macmillan Dictionary - ""The belief that women should have the same rights and opportunities as men"" [5] Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English - ""The belief that women should have the same rights and opportunities as men"" [6] Collins English Dictionary - ""A doctrine or movement that advocates equal rights for women"" [7] Dictionary.com - ""The doctrine advocating social, political, and all other rights of women equal to those of men"" [8] For Con to prove that the definition of Feminism is not about equality, Con must prove that each and every one of the dictionaries above is an unreliable source. If Con cannot, then this debate must concede that Feminism is about equality between men and women by definition. I suggest an alternative viewpoint: A) Feminism is about the equality between men and women, as defined in all the sources above. B) Anyone seeking to gain more than equality is not practicing Feminism (as per the definition) C) There are people who falsely use the Feminism banner to attempt to gain more than equality D) Those who falsely use the Feminism banner should be condemned E) True Feminism (gender equality) is an ideal and should be supported As I mentioned in Round 2, I support equality between men and women. Therefore, I am for Feminism. Con has stated that Con is an ""equalist"" and is ""for the rights of men AND women"". Therefore, like me, Con is for Feminism as defined in the dictionaries. 3. https://en.oxforddictionaries.com... 4. http://dictionary.cambridge.org... 5. http://www.macmillandictionary.com... 6. http://www.ldoceonline.com... 7. http://www.collinsdictionary.com... 8. http://www.dictionary.com...",PRO,"If Con cannot, then this debate must concede that Feminism is about equality between men and women by definition. ...

Furthermore, Con didn't provide any source of definition for Masculinism, so Con's argument is not sound. --- I have offered six authoritative sources stating that Feminism is the movement for equality between men and women.

feminism,"You claim that feminism encourages false rape accusations and stereotyping men as bad. Um... No, that's not what feminism is at all. Feminism is the doctrine advocating social, political, and all other rights of women equal to those of men[1]"". Now, you admit that this is something you are for, so I guess you have problems with how feminists go about this? Really, I think your entire argument stems from a complete misunderstanding of the movement. So, what is feminism? This is a difficult question because, much like religion, feminism is different for each feminist. The mission statement of the movement is equal rights between the sexes, which you agree is good. By this definition, you are a feminist. If you could indicate how you aren't a feminist, that'd be appreciated. Maybe you disagree that there is a systematic discrimination against women, the patriarchy. Is there a patriarchy? Well, as it commonly seems to be the case, I must define ""the patriarchy"". Basically, it means a system where men are valued over women[2]. This can be shown in the wage gap[3], rape culture[4] (though men can be victims of rape, rape culture usually targets women), and gender roles[5]. Rebuttals: What you are saying here is very dangerous. Stating that feminism promotes false rape accusations is an example of rape culture. 60% of victims report abuse, and 97% of abusers will not see jail[6]. Only 1.5-8% of rape reports are fake[7], so Puh-LEASE do not try and say that considerable amount of rape reports are fake and that we should cast doubt on those few that come forward. If we are going of the definition of feminism I stated earlier, then feminists aren't trying to put men as stereotypically bad. We are trying to make men and women equal. If you think that trying to remove the bias towards men is trying to say they are bad, then I am going to have to ask you go to timeout because that idea is downright childish. In the end there you say something about ""calling the police about something ridiculous is obscure"". I think you mean absurd, but if you didn't then I'm not sure what that would mean. If it is obscure, then false rape accusations don't happen often and thus shouldn't be a problem. If you meant absurd, then I would agree that false rape accusations are deplorable, but again I would say that ""false rape reports"" is not a tenant of feminism nor is it a likely to occur.",PRO,"You claim that feminism encourages false rape accusations and stereotyping men as bad.

feminism,"As per the rules of the debate as set by my opponent, this will be my final argument. Since my opponent has failed to formulate a response, I see little need to elaborate much on my previous post. I will merely offer a brief summary of my arguments and this debate as a whole. My opponent claims that feminism is an incorrect argument. While I don't consider feminism an argument, I accepted the debate under these terms so I will argue as such. My opponent has offered nothing but an unsupported opinion regarding what he believes is feminism; a term of which he seems to lack a full understanding. There were no parameters set for this debate in terms of a place in which we were arguing, yet my opponent seems to have focused his argument purely on feminism in the United States. In fact, he basically concedes the debate by stating ""in 1st world countries such as the USA, there should be no such thing as a feminist. The same can not be said for 3rd world countries, where women rights have not been established and women often have to be near a man to go anywhere in the city."" Had we focused this debate on USA or first world countries alone, that statement would not be considered a concession, but the fact that we did not specify those terms shows that my opponent agrees that feminism is at least necessary in some places. Now let's ignore the fact that Con conceded the debate already and pretend we were just addressing first world countries. Con offers no sources to show that equality now fully exists, nor does he provide and decent explanation as to why feminism should disappear once success has been found. The fact of the matter is, inequality between the sexes still exists, as I showed in my previous round, and even once equality is reached here, feminism will still be important to help maintain that equality and to help spread the ideology throughout the countries where help is needed. Finally, if my arguments and sources are not enough to convince the reader, the fact that Con has only provided one poorly written paragraph backed by no sources, merely opinions, followed by a forfeited round, should be enough to win me this debate.

feminism,"Yes certainly. But friend, simply giving your opinion on a topic isn't how you start or maintain a debate. You have to make a claim (or take a stance) on the issue and then give evidence and examples to back up that claim. In my last post, I was just explaining two types of feminism and their views. But since I was confused, I am taking back the first stance I made and am taking the side of Radical feminism (the movement that does these things you mentioned such as ""main spreading"" and ""hepeating""). Radical feminism is a movement whose main focus and objective is to challenge oppressive systems within society. This is incredibly important, as this revolutionary idea is what the United States government is based upon. We may have a system of checks and balances in government, but having one in society (such as this sect of Feminism) in order to keep certain people groups from having too much power is equally important, even if it may be annoying at times.",PRO,"But since I was confused, I am taking back the first stance I made and am taking the side of Radical feminism (the movement that does these things you mentioned such as ""main spreading"" and ""hepeating""). ...

This could start massive revolts that would massacre women and could cause a rebellion against these weak 3rd world countries. Before feminism even comes to these countries, slow progressive changes must be made to deal with each conflict differently. You are very correct that feminism if no longer needed in 1st world countries like the US, but first democracy and peace must reach these areas. Much of these middle eastern countries make these laws due to Islamic influence, as Muslims believe that a woman must cover herself and listen to her husband. What these countries misinterpreted is how Islam doesn't state that husbands have complete control over their wives. Maybe a large religious event where a powerful person gives a touching speech talking about the word of Allah and how his true vision of an Islamic society would be that warms the hearts of Islamic country leaders and somehow influences them to establish laws that establish if not democratic rights or laws, feminism in the country.",CON,"I agree with you that feminism is need in countries where women are oppressed and have little rights, but you must consider the conditions of the countries economy and social interaction because such a movement where they "
feminism,"Thank you for the response, especially since you had a bad internet connection. Let me refute your points. First off, I reject your definition of feminism. I think feminism was the belief that men and women should be equal, but I proved that this is no longer the case in third wave feminism. I also reject your premise, because I stated in my first argument that MODERN feminism is harmful. My opponent has implied that it is the fault of men today that women weren't allowed to vote in some states until 1919. It was wrong that this happened, but taking revenge on men won't solve anything. In fact, it will cause embitterment between both sexes. Your first argument is invalid, because I never said that men and women weren't intellectually equal (although they generally don't have as much physical strength as men do, which I will provide the proof for below). And again, you can't blame the phrasing of the Declaration of Independence on men born two centuries after it was created. I don't think you have won this debate. Maybe I am wrong though.

"" MISANDRY:""dislike of, Contempt for, Or ingrained prejudice against men (i. E. The male sex). "" both groups of people may protest, But overall feminism still play the sane part. They just ask for equality and rights. Equality not absolute oligarchy. The things feminism may protest would be like: ""STOP Gender Pay Gap! "" ""Girls Can Do This!

feminism,"Hi everyone I'm Ilan and I am not a feminist. Immediately alarm bells may be ringing in your mind that maybe this guy is a ""sexist"" or ""a rape apologist"" or anything of the such so just to clarify I am none of these things. I firmly believe that in the idea that everyone should be equal no if ands and or buts. And now you might be thinking why is this guy not a feminist then? Well, the answer to that question is that feminism does not have a monopoly on equality; if you believe in equality you are not automatically a feminist as many feminists like to state. I am in fact an egalitarian. The difference between the two is that feminism is merely about getting equality for women whereas egalitarianism is equality for absolutely everybody. The dictionary definition of egalitarian is ""believing in or based on the principle that all people are equal and deserve equal rights and opportunities."" and that for feminism is ""the advocacy of women's rights on the ground of the equality of the sexes."". Now that we have established some ground I can really start to get into why I am not a feminist. First of all, I am a man. And I am not trying to say that men cannot be feminists, be whatever the hell that you want, but as a man, I feel that I should campaign for my sex and as we have already established feminism is not about gaining equality for all but helping just Women to achieve equality. Even feminists that say that men and other groups are included in feminist issues still do not really campaign for our problems. One major issue that men face is prostate cancer. Prostate cancer kills just as many people as breast cancer does but receives merely half the funding towards research and cures. I have never in my life met a feminist that has agreed with the statement ""Prostate cancer is a feminist issue"" because quite frankly it is not. Many feminists also like to say that MRAs (Men's Rights Activists) are the ones that should be campaigning for male problems but if it really is for everyone then why does feminism not cover everybody's problems. Here I have merely scratched the surface of male problems that feminism does not address such as the fact that 4 times more men commit suicide than women or that 70% of homeless people are estimated to be men or the significantly less jail time for female rapists than men.

Now that I start to think about it, I don't really have a BoP, since my opponent is the one claiming that something (feminism) has a particular characteristic (sexist). Nonetheless, I will do my best to provide good reasons to reject the assertion that feminism is sexist. Reminder: Definition of feminism as stated by my opponent: '[Feminism is] The advocacy [or support thereof] of women’s rights on the ground of the equality of the sexes"" Definition of sexism as stated by my opponent: ""[Sexism is] Prejudice, stereotyping, or discrimination, typically against women, on the basis of sex."" The definition of sexism contains three important words: Prejudice, stereotyping and discrimination. I will address them one by one. Prejudice: Definition: 'Preconceived opinion that is not based on reason or actual experience' http://www.oxforddictionaries.com... Does feminism advocate prejudice on the basis of sex? According to the definition of feminism, it does not; feminism advocates equal rights between men and women. Experience (as well as reason) as thought us that a society in which everyone possesses equal rights is better of than one where that isn't the case. Therefore, one can not say that feminism advocates prejudice on the basis of sex. Stereotype: Definition: 'A widely held but fixed and oversimplified image or idea of a particular type of person or thing' http://www.oxforddictionaries.com... Does feminism use stereotypes on the basis of sex? According to the definition of feminism, it does not; advocating equality between men and women is actually a good way to ELIMINATE stereotypes, which historically have been mostly directed at women (a few examples: http://www.businessinsider.com...). Therefore, one can not say that feminism is using stereotypes on the basis of sex. Discrimination: Definition: 'The unjust or prejudicial treatment of different categories of people, especially on the grounds of race, age, or sex' http://www.oxforddictionaries.com... Does feminism advocate the use of discrimination on the basis of sex? Again, according to the definition of feminism, it does not; advocating equal rights is a good way to make sure that we live in a JUST system. Feminism actually seeks to eliminate the idea that men and women are 'different categories of people'. (I have already covered prejudice). Therefore, one can not say that feminism advocates the use of discrimination on the basis of sex.

abortion,"Abortion is the ending of pregnancy by the removal or forcing out from the womb of a fetus or embryo before it is able to survive on its own. An abortion can occur spontaneously, in which case it is often called a miscarriage. It can also be purposely caused in which case it is known as an induced abortion. The term abortion most commonly refers to the induced abortion of a human pregnancy. The similar procedure after the fetus may be able to survive on its own is medically known as a late termination of pregnancy. There are two kinds of abortion in the U.S. "" in-clinic abortion and the abortion pill. Abortions are very common. In fact, 3 out of 10 women in the U.S. have an abortion by the time they are 45 years old. If you are pregnant, you have options. If you are trying to decide if abortion is the right choice for you, you probably have many things to think about. Learning the facts about abortion may help you in making your decision. You may also want to learn more about parenting and adoption. If you are under 18, your state may require one or both of your parents to give permission for your abortion or be told of your decision prior to the abortion. However, in most states you can ask a judge to excuse you from these requirements. Learn more about parental consent for abortion. Only you can decide what is best for you. But we are here to help. A staff member at your local Planned Parenthood health center can discuss abortion and all of your options with you and help you find the services you need. The debate over whether or not abortion should be a legal option continues to divide Americans. The abortion debate is the ongoing controversy surrounding the moral and legal status of abortion. The two main groups involved in the abortion debate are the self-described ""pro-choice"" movement (emphasizing the right of women to choose whether to abort a pregnancy or to grow it to term) and the self-described ""pro-life"" movement (emphasizing the right of the embryo or fetus to gestate and be born). Both of these ascriptions are considered loaded terms in mainstream media where terms such as ""abortion rights"" or ""anti-abortion"" are generally preferred. Each movement has, with varying results, sought to influence public opinion and to attain legal support for its position, with small numbers of anti-abortion advocates sometimes using violence. I believe a women should be able to decide, without consequences, whether to end the life of their unborn child or proceed with motherhood.",PRO,"In fact, 3 out of 10 women in the U.S. have an abortion by the time they are 45 years old. ...

abortion,"Great, another forfeiter. As someone who has debated abortion before, I will put a link to my original abortion debate right here: http://www.debate.org... I will be using arguments that I used from that debate here, so if you have any questions about my argument, simply read my original arguments. (1) First of all, I would like to define an abortion. “Abortion is the termination ofpregnancy by the removal or expulsion from theuterus of afetus orembryo beforeviability. An abortion can occur spontaneously, in which case it is often called amiscarriage, or it can be purposelyinduced. The term abortion most commonly refers to the induced abortion of a human pregnancy. After viability, the relevant procedure is referred to as a ‘late termination of pregnancy’ Modern medicine utilizes medications and surgical procedures for induced abortion.” From Wikipedia Great. Now that we all know what abortion is, I would like to bring up that Abortion is a right in many countries. Almost every country in the world have abortion that is legal to a degree. Often countries allow abortions only in special cases, like rape, fetal defects and maternal health. Only 6 countries refuse to give abortions under any circumstance. However, many countries allow abortions for any reason. “The landmark abortion case Roe v. Wade, decided on Jan. 22, 1973 in favor of abortion rights, remains the law of the land. The 7-2 decision stated that the Constitution gives ‘a guarantee of certain areas or zones of privacy,’ and that ‘This right of privacy... is broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.’ ” Abortion in many countries is considered a civil right and taking away a right is not a good thing. Why? Simple. Discrimination. Anti-Abortion laws discriminate against rape-victims. Not only is it unfair to the mother but it is also unfair to the child. Imagine growing up with a mother who didn’t want you. This would be very bad. Any ways, I have to wrap things up.

abortion,"Thank you to both the audience and my opponent for yet another debate on abortion. The resolution is simply ""Abortion"" and my opponent has stated that he supports the affirmative. I shall then argue against that case. To begin, I submit the definition of Abortion by Medicine.net Medical Dictionary: Abortion: In medicine, an abortion is the premature exit of the products of conception (the fetus, fetal membranes, and placenta) from the uterus. It is the loss of a pregnancy and does not refer to why that pregnancy was lost. http://www.medterms.com... In addition, here is the wikipedia article in which the introduction defines abortion in the same manner: http://en.wikipedia.org... Since my opponent has used his first round to merely ask for my opening statement and did not clarify the resolution or offer any sort of framing, I will assume that my opponent is trying to affirm ""abortion"" in general. I start by arguing that there are many forms of abortion that should be prevented on moral grounds. 1. Partial Birth Abortions In which the fetus, nearly fully formed, is destroyed during induced labor. At this point in time, the mother might as well wait until full term and give it up for adoption as the already blurry line of morality in abortion becomes even blurrier. 2. Spontaneous Abortions In which a woman with an implanted fetus loses the fetus accidentally, commonly known as a miscarriage. This should be avoided because for the most part, women who miscarry actually wanted the child. 3. Abortions inflicted on unwilling people There is something inherently immoral in the act of walking up to a pregnant woman and kicking in her stomach such that she miscarries. Though this is a form of abortion, I argue that it should in no way be supported. 4. Dangerous abortions I am against many forms of abortion for health reasons. The use of coat hangers to stimulate an abortion, for example. Or throwing oneself off a flight of stairs. Or going to a back-alley abortionist that doubles as a tattoo parlor. These are all very dangerous ways of abortion. I look forward to my opponent's rebuttal. Thank you.",CON,"I shall then argue against that case. ...

abortion,"Although I oppose abortion in most cases, I accepted this debate because Con's position is that abortion ""can never be justified regardless of circumstances."" That is the point I want to disagree with. I don't think anything Con said substantiates his position. He argues that abortion is not justified to avoid hardship, or deal with problems like low self-esteem, sexual exploitation, promiscuity, poverty, lack of education, and absense of moral guidence. I agree with all that. But those do not exhaust the circumstances under which a person might get an abortion; therefore, they do not show that abortion ""can never be justified regardless of the circumstances."" The one circumstance in which I think abortion is morally justified is in cases where the pregnancy puts the mother's life at risk. Abortion is justified in these cases for two reasons. First, it's justified because people have the right to preserve their own lives. Second, it's justified because if a pregnant woman dies, then so does her unborn, and it's better to save one life than to lose two. Since there is a circumstance under which abortion is justified, Con's claim that abortion ""can never be justified regardless of the circumstances"" is false.",PRO,"But those do not exhaust the circumstances under which a person might get an abortion; therefore, they do not show that abortion ""can never be justified regardless of the circumstances."" ...

abortion,"I thank my opponent for his response to my previous statement. ""Whether or not abortion can also be classified as assault is irrelevant to this debate"" (I argue this statement) As a matter of fact it is relevant to this debate. The topic we are discussing is abortion and whether it should be accepted or not. Clearly anyone who is kicked in the stomach has witnessed an act of assault. Abortion is only abortion if it is considered to be or not to be by the child carrier. If not considered abortion, it is only a mere act of assault. This can happen to anyone. I now argue my opponent's ideology of the ""morning after pill"". Referring back to my opponent's definition of abortion, the morning after pill is also another form of abortion. It all eliminates the infant correct? Therefore, my opponent provided another form of abortion that he stated is the solution to pregnancy even though he is supposed to argue against it.

I was only preventing that from being argued. It may not be relevant to the four types of abortion, but it is relevant to the topic at hand. what is right and wrong?: The people in this world have their own basic concept of what is right or wrong. This can also relate to morality. Every single person shares the same individual mindset, their own gathered ideas and opinions of what is right and wrong.

Assault is not moral. But then again we are not talking about assault, we are talking about abortion. Why I did not respond to the other three categories of abortion, well that is the thing....I actually did in a general remark.

abortion,"Abortion is a surgical or medical procedure that ends a pregnancy by destroying and removing the developing child from the uterus. Many young women decide to have an abortion because they believe it will be a quick resolution to a difficult situation. In a survey taken in the first few weeks after the abortion, between 40 and 60 percent of women questioned reported negative reactions. Within 8 weeks after their abortions, 55% expressed guilt and 31% had regrets about their decision. Since life begins at conception, abortion is akin to murder as it is the act of taking human life. Abortion is in direct defiance of the commonly accepted idea of the sanctity of human life. No civilized society permits one human to intentionally harm or take the life of another human without punishment, and abortion is no different. Adoption is a viable alternative to abortion and accomplishes the same result. And with 1.5 million American families wanting to adopt a child, there is no such thing as an unwanted child.

trump,"Firstly i want to thank my opponent for challenging me to this debate and wish them good luck. In my view Donald Trump would be an effective president for the USA. His generally hands off approach to world wide conflicts is in my view a positive thing. Yes he is negative about Russia, China and Iran but it is fair to say these three states do not currently have good relations with the USA anyway, so his policy towards them is no significant change to the previous administration. It is also fair to say these three countries have acted unethically in a variety of ways such as human rights abuses and acting with military aggression. It's fair to say they deserve some criticism. The border wall with Mexico is in my view a great idea. Illegal immigration is a key problem for the USA and if Mexico could be pursuaded to contribute towards the cost of its construction that would be an excellent economic and political result for the USA. What I think makes trump the strongest presidential candidate is the fact that he is not a career politician and has had an enormously succesful career in business. It is clear trump knows how to run a business and knows how a governments actions affect business first hand. Trump is one of the cleverist business brains in the US and surely tapping into that knowledge would be great for the USA. The fact the economy is in a perilous position with national debt and the national budget deficits at record high levels shows the current economic approach is not working. Trump will look at things from an economic point of view not a political point of view. He would also bring in a fresh approach to politics with his say it as it is style.",PRO,"Yes he is negative about Russia, China and Iran but it is fair to say these three states do not currently have good relations with the USA anyway, so his policy towards them is no significant change to the previous"
trump,"Here is the source I will be using: - http://todaysinfo.net... This website lists 13 reasons why Trump will make a great president. I am only going to copy and comment on two of them. 12. ""Trump is planning to build a great, great wall (yes""two ""greats"") on our southern border between the U.S. and Mexico. The best part? He""s planning to have Mexico pay for that wall, and mark his words, """" I will immediately terminate President Obama""s illegal executive order on immigration."""" ""Plus, with less authentic delicious Mexican food here in the U.S., obesity rates will probably drop."" -regardless of of Trump's racist bigotry used to appeal to an old, racist crowd, Immigration IS a problem here in the US and he plans to put an end to it. 1. ""Why would Trump make the best president of all time? Because he said so. ""I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created, I tell you that. I""ll bring back our jobs from China, from Japan, from Mexico and from so many places. I""ll bring back our money. "" Sadly, the American dream is dead. But if I get elected president, I will bring it back bigger and better and stronger than ever before, and we will make America great again."""" By building a wall, fighting ISIS, and strengthening the Christian religion, Trump will make the greatest president of all time. That is my argument. Thankyou",PRO,"Because he said so. ... But if I get elected president, I will bring it back bigger and better and stronger than ever before, and we will make America great again."""""
trump,"Before I jump in, I do not support Trump. I would like to sort of break this down. Yes, he has done several no good deeds, however, I believe the media amplifies his negatives, while shying away from the things he""s done well up to this point. First of all, jobs have been coming in at a continuing growing rate. He has already surpassed 1 million jobs created since early April (currently stands at 1.7 million). The employment rate continues to stay relatively low, at around 4.1%. There is a 62.7% labor participation rate, which is starting to make a comeback from the recession in 2008. There""s also been 159k manufacturing jobs created. Overall, jobs have been growing at a slow and steady rate. Also, the stock market has been doing very well under President Trump. Since Election Day of last year, the Stock Market has gained nearly 5 trillion dollars in monetary value. The main stock that went up exponentially was Dow Jones Industrial (DOW). Their company has surpassed 24k per stock, and will continue to rise, as it has been since the outcome of the 2008 recession. Of course, it""s not that much of an accomplishment, since it has been growing at a continuous rate, but the fact that it keeps climbing is always good. Overall, I believe Trumps cons outweigh his pros, but the government is still holding up, growing in fact. And trust me, there have been several presidents that were worse than Trump. There were several presidents who owned slaves, like George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison. There was Nixon who was part of the Watergate scandal, which eventually forced him to resign. Many more presidents doing way more bad things than Trump. Of course, Washington, Jefferson, even Nixon, didn""t do all that bad. No president can be terrible. Each and every US president has done bad things, yet they""ve also done good things as well. Trump is currently helping sustain our governments wealth and making more US jobs, increasing the GDP, all that fun stuff. As long as the President sustains (or increases) the US wealth, doesn""t kill his citizens, and doesn""t start a World War, I say that""s good.",CON,"I would like to sort of break this down. ...

trump,"First of all, I support O'Malley, but that isn't important. It looks like this debate comes down to Trump's stance on immigration. I showed clear harms from racism - shattered communities, (look at Ferguson if you want proof lol) poor mental and physical health, economic downturns, etc. If Trump becomes president and embraces racism, all these impacts will go nationwide. My opponent has no response to this, so insofar as I can prove Trump is racist, you vote neg. And I showed clear evidence of that, but if you want more, here's how illegal immigrants are treated. Source 3: (http://revcom.us...) These Minutemen inspired by rightwing Republican Pat Buchanan's claim that urgent action is needed to preserve the U.S. as an ethnically white, Christian-European nation. (...) The cold-blooded vigilante attacks on immigrants aren't a new development. Ranchers in Arizona have killed undocumented immigrants for years. They have terrorized them, hunted them down with dogs, and handed them over to the Border Patrol at gunpoint. (...) they have developed deep ties with powerful forces high in the government""and are operating in the era where any paranoid appeal for more security quickly gets official backing and a public hearing. (...) Mile by mile, walls and barbed wire have cut off Mexico from the United States, forcing more and more immigrants to cross over in the dangerous desolate stretches of border in Arizona. It has created an intense conflict zone, as desperate immigrant workers try to cross and survive, and an intensified government crackdown hunts them through the dry hills to trap them, capture them, (...) this reactionary Minuteman movement has emerged to demand even more extreme and violent actions against the immigrants. They have criticized the proposals made by President Bush and Mexico's President Vicente Fox to create a legal program for bringing Mexican immigrants into the U.S. So these Minutemen kill and hunt down not only illegal immigrants, but also innocent Americans. Clearly more anti immigration laws will simply fuel more racism, and the death of innocent people.

trump,"I'll be honest, that was an interesting video, however, I still like him. Here's what I got from the video: 1. He's changed his opinion on multiple issues. I don't see anything wrong with that, if anything, I think he was smart to become a Republican in recent years. Look, times change meaning that a policy that would have worked years ago might not work today and a party that may have appeared favorable once may not appear as favorable now. In 2000, when Trump ran for president under the Reform Party, he believed in universal healthcare as an option. The idea that he maintains that belief, despite what the video said, is ridiculous. In early 2015, he brought up the idea that the government should start making deals with hospitals to help low income Americans. Later, a spokesperson (not Trump himself) stated that Trump would be open to a universal / market-based system that would open up a variety of choices. Today, his official healthcare plan affirms that he supports a 100% free market system, where insurance companies must compete nationwide - the exact opposite of universal healthcare. 2. He's donated to and supported the Bill and Hillary in the past. That makes Trump living proof that we have corrupt politicians in Washington; in fact, that's what brought down primary rivals like Sen. Rand Paul (who accepted money from Trump). The video starts going into conspiracy theory-mode; it theorizes that because Trump donated to them, he secretly supports them and is part of an elaborate plot to make Hillary our next president. First of all, there's no evidence. Second of all, if donating money means working for someone, wouldn't Trump also be working for Rand Paul? And wouldn't he have refrained from calling out Hillary for accepting his donation? 3. He's not extremely religious. I'm okay with that. He said that he does not ask God for forgiveness, and then the video pulls up Bible quote after Bible quote - but who really follows every word of the Bible? If you did, you'd be a criminal; the Bible says that we should stone our children if they are disobedient - which is considered murder, and murder is a crime.

His campaigns in 2016 claimed that, ""He would make America great again"" Our citizens trusted his statement but he lied and took advantage of our trust. Many Americans had made the mistake of voting for him and many have vowed to not vote for him again. I believe Biden has the upper hand in this election, I believe if Biden wins, He will make this country better than Trump claimed he would. Biden has claimed he would help fix climate change, Which has been an ongoing, Environment threatening problem. That Trump has done NOTHING about. Global warming is one of the biggest threats to not just our country, BUT THE WHOLE WORLD. Yet, Our president could care less. Also, When Trump was elected, He had very little political history which should've been a sign that he knew nothing about government. It's almost like citizens voted blindly. Many accusations had been made that Trump was bribing people to vote for him. To be completely and utterly honest, I completely believe that Trump would make such an irrational decision like that. He's ignorant. He is also racist. Back in 2018 I believe, He made many racist comments about Hispanics and yes he did receive extreme backlash but that should be a CLEAR sign to people from everywhere in America that he doesn't deserve the title of ""president"" Now people who have worked hard in their political career, Like Biden, Were just tossed aside as if they hadn't worked hard. Trump grew up and built his career with daddy's money. He didn't work a single day for what he has now, Everything was basically handed to him. He has earned the right to take ""The worst president"" title from James Buchanan. He is the worst president out of the 45 presidents before him. Now that's a record to beat. It's pathetic that his impeachment didn't pass through. That decision would've saved this country a lot of havoc. He has recently ordered police to harm peaceful protesters, For George Floyd's death. Trump's lazy and poor decisions is the reason of Floyd's death. Many events have happened like Floyd's death in the past four years and Trump has done nothing about it. He instead sat there in the white house hiding. Recently, He had many peaceful protesters gathered in front of the white house tear gassed so he do a photo op. He uses his power for selfish needs, He is a selfish man. He made very misogynistic claims in the past, Which still wasn't enough for everyone to see how much of a bad man he was. He is an embarrassment to this country, He is an embarrassment to our presidency. No wonder other countries look down upon us. Receipts have been released of Trump working with Jeffery Epstein to human traffic. So not only is he misogynistic and racist. He's also a rapist.

trump,"dustryder has beaten me to the punch in the comments. You have agreed completely or partially with all the points you laid out. It may be that your initial definition was a bad one (or a too loosely defined one) but that’s irrelevant. You laid out a series of points that define fascist ideology. Trump fulfills or partially fulfills them all. Therefore Trump must be a fascist to a certain extent. One of the points themselves, Does not a fascist make. Not every nationalist is a fascist and almost everyone is a little nationalist. However when all of the points are true that does point to a certain ideology. It is true that all of these points apply to a lesser extent to almost every politician. That doesn't mean that every politician is a fascist (it might indicate that political power and fascism go hand in hand though). In normal vocabulary fascist is a relative describer. Hitler was a fascist only when contrasted to the west, In Germany many people considered him rational, Etc. . . So when we look to see if Trump's position on all these issues makes him a fascist we have to see if his positions are considered more than ordinary or fringe. It is irrefutable that our political system is more divided than ever, We know that almost all democrats (half of active voters) despise Trump and consider him fringe. We know that a significant portion of Republicans disagree with him but chose him as a lesser of two evils. Meaning that his views directly represent a minority of the population, Making him fringe.

Point1: Vagueness My opponent formulated the debate thesis in this way: ""President Trump doesn't lie (in all its shades and varieties) in a manner worthy of special tracking. His lack of complete honesty is in line with the mainstream of US politicians and media outlets nowadays. "" There are two glaring issues with the thesis as it stands that makes the burden of demonstrating a lie almost impossible. The first problem occurs with the use of ""special tracking. "" What might constitute ""special tracking? "" Because Red_Fox does not give a criteria for what would distinguish such a lie, Such that it would warrant the description of ""special, "" it is equally possible that Red-Fox's subjective interpretation is the criteria, In which case no one could effectively contradict the thesis, Or all lies are equally ""special, "" which would mean I could affirm the thesis convincingly by stating a single lie from Donald Trump The second vague phrase within the thesis is ""is in line. "" Like before, Red_Fox did not offer any criterion from which to distinguish a base line of dishonesty with a level needed to affirm the thesis. Point 2: Collusion While not the central thesis itself, My opponent used the Washington Post's fact check of Donald Trump's statements on collusion as an example of how the media is dishonest in its reporting; however, There are several problems with this. 2. 1 Donald Trump's statements on collusion are not isolated; rather, They are coupled with other claims (for example, His trashing of the Steele Dossier as fake despite it containing now confirmed details such as Trump-Russia and Trump-China business dealings) such that his entire statement is false 2. 2 Muller's investigation is not solely about collusion anyways so it is irrelevant.",CON,I happy to accept my opponent Red_Fox's challenge to discuss the important issue of whether or not Donald Trump is a liar and look forward this debate.

trump,"Since you have provided a definition of Fascism for this debate we will work on that definition. You define 4 main qualities that can differentiate a Fascist ideology from a non-fascist one. I will not argue either that Trump fulfills these ideologies completely or that they are the total of his policies. You can have fascist socialists (Nazis), Fascist Communists (Communists), And even fascist-like communal states (cults). Fascism is the name we give to a way of political thinking, Not an ideology in itself. So I move onto the 4 terms you specified: . . . That exalts nation and often race above the individual. . . This is probably the easiest to justify. MAGA is an issue of American pride, Exalting the nation above the individual. Nationalism by itself isn't a bad thing but to a certain degree it's taking away the identity of the individual and putting a social or state identity that people should defend or make ""great"". . . . That stands for a centralized autocratic government headed by a dictatorial leader. . . So here we are talking about degree's. Trump does not have absolute control of America (which would make him a complete dictator), But he is centralizing control of the National government and especcialy to his branch of government. A prime example is the issue of the wall. Where Trump, Unable to pass the plan through congress, Used a power of the executive branch (national emergency) to call for the wall anyway. This has been a consistent theme of his presidency. Him vs. Congress (which his party had control of anyway for the first two years) and him vs. The States (travel ban) . . . Severe economic and social regimentation. . . Again, Degrees. Trump has certainly leaned more towards economic regimentation (trade war with China, Criticism of NAFTA and free trade policies in general) and also social issues (Transgender ban, Appointing anti-pot Attorney General) . . . Forcible suppression of opposition. . . Trump has routinely called the media, His critics, And the actual oppositions the following: Fake news, Enemy of the people, phoney. The list of insults he has actually used is amazing. Although he has only used his power as president to forcibly suppress these voices vary rarely (banning CNN from whitehouse). The main force of trumps power is undoubtedly online and through a mob mentality of calling everything fake news. And even though this is not what we immediately think of as ""forcible"" is is still a type of force and so the statement is true to a certain degree.

trump,"The man leading the current race for the presidency is who? None other than Donald J. Trump. Why is this? Why are people voting for him? I'm both curious and scared. To start this debate, I'll use one of the most obvious points as to why people should not be voting for this man. Racism. In a world that is constantly moving forward, away from a time of racism and prejudice, why is it that there are so many people voting for a man who wishes to bring an end to equality for coloured people? This world is always changing, always evolving, and I had thought that humans, as a species, had moved on from blanket racism. Apparently not, if the majority of Americans are voting for a man who has openly endorsed racist violence. This brings me to another issue on equality. Donald Trump has expressed interest in rescinding marriage equality rights for members of the LGBTQ+ community. He says he is for 'natural marriage'. As I have already said, this world is forever moving onwards. Why take away the rights of a person simply because of their sexual orientation? Why vote for the person that wants to? Trump has also said that he has a big issue with Muslims. This is another example of blanket racism from the man himself. If a minority of Muslims are part of fundamentalist and extremist groups, does that really mean that you should tame away the right to worship from the majority? What Donald Trump, and indeed the people who vote for him for this reason, have failed to realise is that the majority of Muslims are not a part of these groups. He has expressed wishes to close the mosques, but for what reason? Does he really think that will solve his 'problem'? Do you?

Tired of their empty promises to give this and that, but what makes you think he will be any different? What makes you believe his promises more than anybody else's?

brexit,"Hello! I have a number of arguments that will be elaborated upon in further posts. For now, here they are: 1. Global Economic Impact As we have already seen, the Brexit has already led to severe economic implications in markets worldwide. Over $2 trillion have already been lost just in one day (June 24).This has resulted in worldwide stock markets plunging in value. Spain's IBEX 35 fell 12.5%, NASDAQ fell 3.6%, Europe's Euro Stoxx 50 tumbled 9.1%, and Japan's NIKKEI 225 fell 7.9%. The British pound has plummeted to its lowest level in thirty years in just one day! British trade will be hindered by not being able to easily trade with the continent. This will inevitably result in further economic trouble in Britain even after this initial damage outlined above. As for Europe: the EU just lost its biggest economy. This will mean that the whole of Europe just got a whole lot poorer, because Britain no longer has easy access to trade. What will this mean for countries like Greece? What will happen to the European continent if there's an economic downturn? The financial security of Europe and all of its trading partners will be made much weaker because of Brexit. 2. Impact on Britain As we both know, there was a referendum in Scotland in September of 2014 to secede from the UK. It failed and the UK is still whole. In the Brexit vote, Scotland voted overwhelmingly to stay in the EU. Already there is talk in Scotland of seceding and rejoining the European Union. There is also a movement starting for the reunification of Ireland (meaning the UK would also lose Northern Ireland). If these happen and the UK is split into three pieces, the consequences will be both profound and irreparable. The UK is our strongest ally overseas. If it splits, NATO, the UK, and the US will be much less powerful, both militarily and economically. Brexit has already set this in motion. Would you (or anybody) knowingly and willingly support the weakening of our country? 3. Peace in Europe The organizations that led to the EU were founded in 1945, just after World War II. The idea was to create a union of countries that would be so closely intertwined that war between them would be unthinkable.

brexit,"Anti-Brexit had the facts, Brexit had the rhetoric. Irrational fear of immigration and losing autonomy. Britain clearly needs migrants considering it's own workers don't want to work the dirty jobs such as farming so migrants need to do it for them. [1] Let's Look at the facts. Britain's Membership in the EU costs around 6.3 Billion pounds or 0.3% of britains GDP. So for the leave side to be economically superior leaving would not be able to affect the UK by more than 0.3%. But considering the UK makes 13% of it's GDP from selling commodties to the EU this seems unlikely. [2] The problem with this is that economists predict that the UK could lose up to 6% of It's GDP from leaving the EU which is much greatet than 0.3% [3] This isn't even including additional costs for tarrifs that would amount to close of the cost for eu membership after free trade deals are abolished along with eu membership. [4] Also, Britain has complete control of their immigration policy so leaving would do almost nothing when it comes to immigration policy. Not to mention that 70% of Britain's population increase came from immigration. Limiting immigration radically could have some pernicious effects.

brexit,"While there may be a few advantages to the Brexit, I find it very unnecessary. From now on, It could only go wrong and Theresa May has brought the UK to its now inevitable so-called ""economic disaster"". For example, The Panasonic Corp is to move its European headquarters from London to Amsterdam in October to avoid potential tax issues linked to the Brexit. This is a loss of hundreds of jobs, Which is definitely detrimental to the UK population. Even though the flow of immigrants are stemmed, This could be highly detrimental to the availability of jobs in the UK, Especially London where the headquarters are located. It's not a surprise that other companies move their headquarters to other countries of the EU as well, Which results in more job loss. In my opinion, The Brexit is definitely one of the biggest downfalls the UK has experienced and it's a shame that the population of the UK even voted that it would be a good idea. Now, The citizens of the UK, As well as the EU, Will suffer multiple difficulties and struggles over the next few years.

UK's FDI is worth 1 trillion [1]. Foreign investors like investing in the UK because it gives them easy access to the EU's single market (which means less borders in moving goods, less tarriffs, and more profit). Brexit makes it harder for UK to trade with EU. Deals can be made but will probably not be as good as it was before Brexit. Thus, investors look elsewhere than UK. UK loses a varied amount of FDI. Graph: http://tinyurl.com... Any deals made, is likely to be complicated. The leaders of the EU have already said that in order for UK to access the single market, it must allow free movement of EU workers (for them to easily immigrate to the UK). [2] Brexit means EU workers may not meet requirements for working in the UK, especially filling out the infamous UK visa test for non-EU citizens. About 3/4 of EU workers would fail this test, those in the primary and secondary sector (farming, hotel staff etc.). [3] It's not just a problem of foreign workers.

Brittan postponed it because the economic and social impact of a hard ""no-deal Brexit"" are disastrous. Trade The EU allows open trade between all countries within the union.

brexit,"Outline: When considering whether a policy is a “mistake,” everything should be accounted for and if a policy will bring more bad than good, it should be considered a mistake. In other words, neither Con nor I need to show that Brexit is completely good or bad either way for Britain. Merely, we need to show that, all things considered, Brexit is a net positive or negative for the UK. Argument 1-Economic Effects: Con has conceded this whole argument; therefore, we both agree that Britain will face an economic downturn as a result of leaving the EU. This means that Con accepts that Britain will suffer economically from the loss of free trade deals and lack of immigration to stimulate the economy. Argument 2-Scotland: Con failed to respond to or even reference this argument. Therefore, due to a lack of rebuttal, the point stands that Brexit will most likely lead to Scottish independence. Con’s Case: Con’s case can be broken up into three arguments: disadvantages of open borders (his third paragraph), the burden of the EU’s complex constitution (his fourth paragraph), and the benefits of being an independent a nation (his fifth paragraph). I will address each of these separately. Rebuttal 1-Open Borders: Con’s argument for open borders is riddled with bare assertions and absent of any evidence. Con’s argument can essentially be boiled down to the idea that the EU does a “lousy job of isolating terrorism,” yet an independent UK would be much more efficient at spotting out terror threats. However, neither of these ideas is presented with any evidence. Thus, there is no reason to accept Con’s argument that Britain would deal with terrorism better without the EU. Rebuttal 2-Complex Constitution: Once again, Con provides no evidence for his argument. He argues that, because the EU has a relatively complex constitution, it leads to corruption because it’s confusing. However, that argument is ultimately unconvincing because no evidence is provided. He mentions how the American constitution works better because its simplicity allows Americans to fight for their rights more. However, there is no evidence for this, nor is there evidence that the EU is corrupt and trampling on the people’s rights. Once again, this leaves Con’s argument empty. Rebuttal 3-Benefits of Independent: Con continues to argue with bare assertions, absent of any evidence. This argument can essentially be boiled down to the fact that being an independent nation is better and that Britain will bounce back, better than ever. It’s a really idealistic argument, but lacks any substance. For instance, there is no reason to accept the premise that being an independent nation is better. He simply states it, along with brief mentions of freedom of speech, national border protection, and national pride. Border protection has already been discussed, but he doesn’t show how the EU suppresses Britain’s freedom of speech or national pride; Con also fails to demonstrate why either of those helps the UK. Con also fails to provide a reason to believe Britain’s economy will bounce back, beyond bare assertions. No statistics to demonstrate this and he had already conceded to my arguments that would suggest otherwise. Therefore, there is no reason to accept any of Con’s statements in this argument. Conclusion: To conclude, due to a lack of any evidence, Con has failed to provide any convincing reasons why passing Brexit was a good decision. Also, due to Con having no rebuttal to my points that passing Brexit was a bad decision, it stands that passing Brexit was mistake for the UK.",PRO,"Rebuttal 1-Open Borders: Con’s argument for open borders is riddled with bare assertions and absent of any evidence. ...

brexit,"I appreciate your response, So here is my final debate round Security of the country is more important than trade. Just look at what is happening in the rest of Europe. The migrant crisis is reaching epic proportions all the way to France because the borders were open and the migrants came cross all borders unobstructed. From Italy and Turkey through the rest of open Europe through the poorer nations all heading for England the most prosperous country in the EU. A border crossing with northern and southern Ireland is also critical in keeping the IRA at bay and controlling movement of people. Open borders are a disaster for security reasons. It might be easier to cross borders for regular travelers but lets look at the Sicilian mafia, They are now free to roam all over Europe, The Russian mafia has open borders to travel to England right now and poison people with polonium. The Gypsies can roam all around Europe without obstruction. And finally the migrants from the middle east including ISIS can freely cross from Turkey to anywhere in Europe. Everybody is complaining about Brexit until the bombs go off in France and England or a 1000 women are raped in Germany over the holidays because there is no control at the border. Switzerland and Norway are not in the EU and they are doing excellent. Not everyone needs to be in a big EU boys club. Countries all separated a long time ago because people couldn't get along. Yugoslavia split into 6 countries because they couldn't get along, Who says we need to make one big Europe country? Have we not learned from the Roman empire, From the Ottoman empire. Countries are created every decade in Africa, In the past in South America. Panama did not want to be part of Columbia so they created their own country with a border. Not having borders or having open borders is a bad idea. That's like not having a fence with your neighbor. And besides why should England pay 13 billion euros to the EU, How much is Romania and Bulgaria paying? Nothing. England is a rich prosperous country, They don't need to be part of the EU clan that is suffering from migrant invasions and terrorism. Besides other countries are pulling out too, Poland and Sweden mentioned they might pull out next.

brexit,"I will first begin my addressing the rebuttals made by my opponent to defend my arguments. My opponent started off by accusing me of not understanding opportunity cost. Let me assure him that I have quite a good idea of what opportunity cost means. He then brings in some technical terms with the hopes of confusing us to believe in him. Basically, he brushes off my argument which is the net high costs of remaining in the EU by accusing my data as biased and claiming that the opportunity of free trade justifies the cash. We have to remember that the costs of remaining in the EU have been rising STEADILY these past few years. If it has just been rising the last couple of years, yes, we might still be optimistic. But the truth is we are starting to question how much of a benefit this supposed free trade is when the figures have continuously been rising. When you consider that these costs are almost at par with medical costs in Britain, how long can we trick ourselves into thinking that ""you know, this is all for free trade. All this cost is justified."" And that is why I brought up the countries Norway and Switzerland. These countries are proof that you can stay out of the EU without having to succumb to membership fees. I was not at all implying that Britain should adopt a Nordic model. Of course, as a country with values of its own, they should negotiate a different treaty and a different model that suits them. Finally, I agree that America has no rights to comment on the Brexit. I was in no way implying that we should 'make Britain great again' as per Trump's model. And I never said that we should disallow refugees/migrants. I said that we should be able to draw our own laws up and not follow Brussel's laws, if for nothing else other than to maintain Britain's standing in the eyes of the world as an independent and strong nation. ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Now I will rebut my opponent's points. My opponent claimed that Britain throughout history has almost had strong ties with Europe and they have prospered. TO this argument, I will say that times have changed. When you look at how Greece, France and Spain's economies are struggling, you start to ask questions of how much longer Britain is expected to help out. My opponent then said Britain must not close its borders. Who said anything about closing borders?

death penalty,"As you can see, my opponent has forfeited his last round. He also has not explained why any kind of death penalty, including the voluntary death penalty proposal I have provided, should be abolished or not exist. In fact, he completely ignored my main case for the debate of a voluntary death penalty. The topic of the debate is not the current death penalty in the United States. The topic is simply 'Death penalty' as you can see at the top of this page. Because my opponent did not specify the kind of death penalty, my opponent, under assumption, is against any kind of death penalty proposal. Yet, my opponent only argued against the current death penalty in the United States. My opponent did not make any case against my proposal of a voluntary death penalty.

But my opponent did not specify that the debate revolved around the current death penalty, but any kind of death penalty. And because of this, my arguments are superior to his. Reasons for voting Pro: 1. Cost: A voluntary death penalty would be much cheaper than life in prison or even the current death penalty. My opponent has not denied this. 2. Deterrence of Crime: My opponent basically said that deterrence of crime is not why punishments are made. His argument against a death penalty is weak because basically any other form of punishment would not deter crime either. 3. International Law: My opponent argues that the current death penalty violates international law. However, the debate is not about the current death penalty, it is about any kind of penalty the invokes death. A voluntary death penalty would not only be in compliance with international law, but would give more personal liberty back to convict. My opponent did not deny this fact. 4. Risk of executing innocents: My opponent only gives a weak 10-word rebuttal to my proposal that a voluntary death penalty would make the issue of executing innocents moot. 5. Death sentences are racist and unfair: My opponent does not give any argument against my proposal that a voluntary death penalty would make the issue of racism in death penalties to also become moot.

death penalty,"This debate will be on the death penalty. I will be arguing against the death penalty being a good thing. My opponent who will be 'pro' will argue in favour of the death penalty. Whoever my opponent will be I would like to wish them good luck and hope for an interesting and fun debate. Here is my reasoning on why the death penalty is a bad thing. One of the strongest reasons I think why the death penalty is a bad idea is the amount of innocent people that it has killed. The justice system is not perfect and many innocent people have been convicted by it, The problem with the death penalty is that there is no way to go back on sentences and fix mistakes when new information about a case is found. There have been a number of people in the US who have been sentenced to death who later have been found out to be innocent. If these people were just sent to prison these mistakes could have been reversed and fixed. Secondly I find the argument that the death penalty will deter crime to be a bad one. I feel that this is very logical. If someone is that messed up in the head to even consider killing someone or doing something equally as bad and inhumane, Do you really think that the prospect of death is going to deter them from doing it? Also, One thing that I've noticed many people who are in favour of the death penalty don't realise is that the death penalty is in fact very expensive. According to the Death Penalty Information Centre, In the US the average costs for a non-death penalty murder case is $1. 1 million ($870, 000 in imprisonment, $250, 000 in trial), While the average costs for a death penalty case are $3 million ($1. 3 million in imprisonment, $1. 7 million in trial). For these reasons and more I strongly believe that the death penalty is a bad thing and should absolutely be repealed in countries that it is implemented in such as the US. https://deathpenaltyinfo.

death penalty,"Though there are people who say that the death penalty is cruel and unusual, there are the facts that the possibility of the death penalty actually does cross most criminals minds before committing a murder. In an article by Michael Kronenwetter, the facts are clear about the death penalty, ""In the early 1970s, the Los Angeles Police Department conducted interviews with 99 criminals who had not carried lethal weapons when they committed their crimes. According to the police, roughly half gave fear of the death penalty as the reason for their decision to reject weapons.""

death penalty,"The death penalty is useless. It is morally wrong, inefficient, and observably ineffective in accomplishing several key goals. Historically, there have been five presumably legitimate purposes for punishment: (1) Retribution, (2) Deterrence, (3)Rehabilitation, (4)Incapacitation, and (5)Public Education.

The death penalty is justified only under one criterion, and that criterion is not enough by itself to justify any punishment. (1) Retribution The death penalty does provide retribution. It provides retribution at a cost of an additional $90,000 per inmate on death row. [2] Life imprisonment is less costly, and an equally valid form of retribution. Even assuming that retribution is valid, the death penalty is still inefficient compared to life sentencing, an equally valid alternative. Where two processes are proposed to meet the same end, assuming the same result, the more efficient process should be favored. Life imprisonment and the death penalty both remove the freedom of an individual to act. One method is simply more costly and eliminates all of the offender's potential value. Therefore, the death penalty is the worse of two methods of accomplishing the same ends, and must be discredited under a theory of retribution. (2) Deterrence The death penalty does not deter. [3] (3) Rehabilitation The death penalty does not rehabilitate, obviously. (4) Incapacitation The death penalty does incapacitate. Incapacitation, however, is an invalid goal by itself. If incapacitation alone could justify the death penalty, then it would be proper to extend it to every instance of every criminal act ever conducted. After all, the argument goes, they wouldn't reoffend. Similarly, most people who argue for prison reform are concerned for rising costs. Life imprisonment is just as valid a form of incapacitation. It is also less costly. If incapacitation is the goal, then life imprisonment is still the better alternative. (5) Public Education If the death penalty does educate the public, it doesn't do it in the way it aims to. [4] [5] By increasing the incidence of homicide, the death penalty clearly could not accomplish its ends under this criterion. Conclusion The death penalty is therefore not justified. If the death penalty is not justified, it is the unjustified taking of another's life. The unjustified taking of another's life is murder. Murder is morally wrong. Therefore, the death penalty is morally wrong. The death penalty is therefore inefficient, ineffective and morally wrong. It should be discarded. Sources [1] http://www.wcl.american.edu...

death penalty,"First of all I would like to make my ""map points"" as to why I am oppose to the death penalty. 1. The cost One my argue by logic that the cost is much higher for life imprisonment because you would have to feed him everyday etc.... for the rest of their lives right. # A 2003 legislative audit in Kansas found that the estimated cost of a death penalty case was 70% more than the cost of a comparable non-death penalty case. Death penalty case costs were counted through to execution (median cost $1.26 million). Non-death penalty case costs were counted through to the end of incarceration (median cost $740,000). (December 2003 Survey by the Kansas Legislative Post Audit) # In Tennessee, death penalty trials cost an average of 48% more than the average cost of trials in which prosecutors seek life imprisonment. (2004 Report from Tennessee Comptroller of the Treasury Office of Research) # In Maryland death penalty cases cost 3 times more than non-death penalty cases, or $3 million for a single case. (Urban Institute, The Cost of the Death Penalty in Maryland, March 2008) # In California the current system costs $137 million per year; it would cost $11.5 million for a system without the death penalty. Innocence I will start off with a quote from Governor George Ryan of Illinois ""I cannot support a system which, in its administration, has proven so fraught with error and has come so close to the ultimate nightmare, the state's taking of innocent life... Until I can be sure that everyone sentenced to death in Illinois is truly guilty, until I can be sure with moral certainty that no innocent man or woman is facing a lethal injection, no one will meet that fate."" Since 1973, 130 people have been released from death rows throughout the country due to evidence of their wrongful convictions. In 2003 alone, 10 wrongfully convicted defendants were released from death row. 3. Death Penalty does not help anything There are no proven records that say that states that have the death penalty have lower crimes rates of any sort. People do not think right before they shot a guy in the face. ""Oh wait, this state has the death penalty"". Actually, states that do not have the death penalty have lower crime rates http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org... 4.

Murder is murder and capital punishment is just that murder, simple to just kill killers but what does that make you? It makes you a killer but with public opinion on your side and a notion of justice which isn't the case. Why is it that America holds a sanctity for life, and yet kill people for killing people how does that make sense its hypocritical. Case: 1. The death penalty can and has killed innocent people, the government has killed innocents making it murder. Under the death penalty rules technically all the people in the cases with innocent people killed should themselves be put on trial and killed. However it doesn't work that way, the accused is the only one getting blamed for a crime and if innocent but proven guilty will get the death penalty but then proven innocent after the sentence has already been carried out the government just goes oops sorry. 2. Death penalty cost more than life in prison without parole. Evidence : Dudley Sharp, Death Penalty Resources Director of Justice For All (JFA), in an Oct. 1, 1997 Justice for All presentation titled ""Death Penalty and Sentencing Information,"" wrote: ""Many opponents present, as fact, that the cost of the death penalty is so expensive (at least $2 million per case?), that we must choose life without parole ('LWOP') at a cost of $1 million for 50 years. Predictably, these pronouncements may be entirely false. JFA estimates that LWOP cases will cost $1.2 million - $3.6 million more than equivalent death penalty cases. There is no question that the up front costs of the death penalty are significantly higher than for equivalent LWOP cases. There also appears to be no question that, over time, equivalent LWOP cases are much more expensive... than death penalty cases. Opponents ludicrously claim that the death penalty costs, over time, 3-10 times more than LWOP.""

Retribution is in fact revenge, the simple fact of sentencing someone to the death penalty is revenge for their supposed crime.

death penalty,"There are many reasons why the death penalty is a much easier, cheaper, and overall, smarter way to deal with those criminals who, as an undisputed fact, need something harsher than a simple decade or two in jail. 1) First, the death penalty, contrary to the believe of some, is actually a relatively humane way to carry out an execution. We can all agree that the death penalty (like a lethal shot) is much more humane than a public hanging, or even a private hanging for that matter. 2) Also, the death penalty is a much less costly way to deal with criminals than a life sentence. A life sentence costs on average $1.5 mil while the death penalty costs $90000 per person.

death penalty,"There are many reasonable arguments against the death penalty. However, we are dealing with a life and death issue. When dealing with an issue of this magnitude I believe there should be great consequences. Statistics reveal that the death penalty is very costly. I think that when an issue regards human life all costs must be put aside. The actions that lead to the death penalty further justify the reason to put the aside the price. As a nation, the United States has a priority to stand by people and their rights. A nation that solely focuses on cost is a nation that does not have its priorities in line. Being a nation of the people, I think we must stand beside the victims and protect their violated rights. The 15th amendment states that ""no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law"" (US Constitution). Simply, without the due process of law a person can not be deprived of their natural rights. This amendment stands alongside the victims. If a criminal is willing to interfere, break the law and deprive a person of their rights, I believe they should be punished to the maximum extent. If murderers do not value the rights of others, they should not be allowed to have those rights for themselves. Along with serving justice, the death penalty focuses on reasonable retribution. In order to be in consideration to earn the death penalty, a person must go to great measures to break laws. In the state of Texas to get the death penalty you must have committed a murder of a public officer, multiple persons, a person under 16 years of age and during a felony. Committing a murder in the first degree in Florida makes a person eligible for the penalty (Death Penalty Information Center). What it takes to be deserving of the punishment are the most ruthless and gruesome of crimes. The death penalty takes the lives of inhuman killers and law breakers. Not your everyday shoplifters and car thieves are prosecuted to receive the death penalty. Only the most extreme of criminals are eligible for the punishment. I believe that an extreme law breaker should be punished in an extreme manner. Jails and prisons are for people to be rehabilitated. Death is for those who commit the few and most dangerous of laws.",PRO,"The 15th amendment states that ""no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law"" (US Constitution). ...

death penalty,"The idea that the death penalty is unjustified on lower crimes is not the topic of today's debate. The parameters set was the death penalty, which means that any strain of the death penalty can be defended. In this instance, murder/rape only is a reasonable standard to weigh the death penalty on. The claim made that someone was killed for being alone in a mall can be assumed to be either misinterpreted or false. Since my opponent does not mention a case, and since being alone in a mall is not a crime, that was obviously not the reason for the charge. My opponent also claims the death penalty increases the crime rate and cites the discovery channel. However, actual studies in the US, which due to their accuracy on US politics ought to be preferred, show that the death penalty is a DETERRENT for crime. (Ex:http://abc7news.com...) This is extremely important as it shows that the death penalty is not a way to seek revenge by the state, as stated by my opponent, but rather way to save net lives. I addressed this point in my last speech, but my opponent did not address it which means that it is still relevant in today's round. My opponent looks at conversion as the only evidence to claim that crime is reduced in nations without the death penalty. Yet, they offer no conversion rates or evidence for this beyond their own words. Donald Calloway would not have received the death penalty anyways because his crime was drugs as a minor, not punishable by death.

Death penalty should exist because when someone commits a crime that's so violent the end result can cause hundreds to die. If there is no death penalty then the maniac will still kill more people. Death penalty is used to get rid of bad people so bad that hundreds die. If you think the Death penalty is bad because it kills people you must not know what the purpose of it is. The death penalty is a way to put fear into the criminal and to put fear into others. Crime has decreased and the death penalty still lives. Several tests have shown that the death penalty is an effective deterrent of future crimes. Do people who commit heinous crimes, such as the bombers, really have human rights. To say that we are lowering ourselves to that level is wrong. Killing over 200 innocent lives. We have to look as well at the possibilities of these criminals committing crimes again. In Australia murder, on average, is imprisonment for 12 years. This means many murders are set free, able to commit further crimes. Benefits of death penalty - decreases jail over population - puts fear into other criminals and shows a purpose - It avenges innocent lives - It decreases crime.

One small but important reason on why the death penalty is a good idea is that it decreases the prisoner population, which saves even more tax payers money. Another reason why the death penalty is a good idea, Once a criminal is executed, he cannot kill again. The case for this would be Kenneth Allen McDuff who was on Death Row when the death penalty was declared unconstitutional in the 1970's. His sentence was commuted to life and he was eventually released on parole and killed again. He has since been executed My final reason for this round is that the death penalty is actually a very good deterrence. If you look at this link: http://www.prodeathpenalty.com... You see a chart.

One mistake i made is that in some cases the death penalty is not COMPLETELY painless, but i was wanting to make the point that in most cases, it's less painful than a lot of deaths. ""The death penalty is a misuse and waste of taxpayer dollars"". So you are saying that sentencing someone to the death penalty uses to many tax payers dollars, so keeping them in prisons and feeding them three meals a day along with airconditioning and electricity saves money? How many families struggle to feed their families and keep the lights on, while criminals sit here in prisons for 30 years and have everything some families struggle for, for free, and thats fair? And that doesn't waste money? If a person is sentenced to life in prison at age 37, at age 77, on average, it will cost a state more than $4 million dollars. (http://www.phoenix.edu...)

Another point i must make, the death penalty is a source of intimidation. If someone kwows the death penalty is strictly enforced, more than likely that person will think twice about committing the crime. Its common sense, if someone knows there are consequences, if a person understands that their life will be taken if they take someone else's life, less crimes will be committed.

google,"“Every company and every individual in the world is a Google target. Google CEO Eric Schmidt : We are in the search business, so we need all of the information…We’re also in the advertising business, and we’d like to provide advertising services to people who have their own proprietary content. So depending on where we are in that spectrum, we either do an advertising deal or a content deal or a hybrid deal. But ultimately our goal at Google is to have the strongest advertising network and all the world’s information, that’s part of our mission. Google wants all of “the world’s information” (including individuals’ personal information), it wants to sell advertising to all of the world and it wants to distribute its advertising throughout all of the world. Is the Google world circle a virtuous one?” This means that even though I personally don’t the Daily Mail newspaper is most credible source of information on anything, I’m clicking on it’s links because they are top Google results for anything I search for. restricted academic Journals accessible only via Student portals/Moodles/JSTOR are harder for me to use as references because they are not globally/universally accessible even though many(Le controversial Lancet, included) are far better information resources than top Google results. Now I would prefer to get my science news largely from ‘The New Scientist” or “The Scientific American” because even they are magazines they are ‘science’ mags and they have less scientific errors than say a health-related article in say, ‘Newsweek’ or other non-scientific equivalents. Just as I personally would prefer getting my Economics/Finance info from the Economist or Bloomberg or the LSE(London School of Economics)/UC(University of Chicago) websites, but are articles in these mags or from these universities ever Top Google results for Econ-related issues? Google gives leeway to unreliable authorities in many subject areas to dictate what we perceive as the today’s reality. Spam on miracle cures falsely reported to be sponsored by celebrities is all over Google.

google,"you`re right that bing doesn`t have more services like google has. But there services are really not worthwhile. For instance lets consider Google Docs. GOOGLE DOCS ISN`T READY FOR GAMBLE , MAKES YOU LESS PRODUCTIVE. Jake Zborowski, Microsoft""s senior product manager for Office, actually published two anti-Docs blog posts today: one homes in on document fidelity, and the other, which includes a number of user testimonials, argues that Google Docs isn""t quite ready for primetime. There is, of course, also a video that accompanies the post, which reminds folks that they could lose their promotion if they decide to switch to Docs: http://www.youtube.com... Zborowski also argues that Google Docs is missing too many features, though in this case, a number of Microsoft customers make the argument for him. Here is an example: ""As we continue to improve Office, we look for changes big and small that help people do more with less effort. Some improvements are small, like the new paste options we introduced in Office 2010. Other features reduce the amount of time it takes to accomplish a task like Flash Fill and Quick Analysis in Excel. The breadth of capabilities Office can lead to significant gains in what people can accomplish. With Google Docs, on the other hand, people have to find ways to overcome feature gaps by working harder, spending their time finding workarounds, or potentially using third-party tools to overcome the gaps."" ""When we switched from Google Apps to Office 365, we freed our people to work together in synergy, and it has produced good results in every area of our business."" "" Andy Springer, Director, Rookie Recruits To back all of this up, Microsoft also launched whymicrosoft.com, which includes more testimonials, screenshots and other resources for those who haven""t been scared straight yet and are still considering the switch to Google Docs.

google,"Google has been at it for longer-and it shows.Experience plays a significant role in Google's and Microsoft's ability to compete in the search space. Google has spent more than a decade tweaking its search to ensure that it adequately appeals to user desire. Microsoft, on the other hand, has only really been competing earnestly in the search space for a couple years. It was only a few years ago when Microsoft finally woke up and realized that if it doesn't improve its standing in the search market, it could lose its profitability and be kept out of the Web. That lack of experience is showing with Bing. Although the search engine has come a long way in the last year that it has been available, Google, the veteran, is still far ahead. 7. It's Caffeinated Google announced recently that it has moved to a new indexing service, called Caffeine. According to the company, Caffeine offers ""50 percent fresher results for Web searches"" than its last index. That's extremely important. Rather than waiting days, weeks and sometimes months for content to get added to Google's index, it could now take minutes or hours. Not only will that help content providers, it will also improve the experience of searchers who want to find information on some of the news they heard about that day. Bing is still far behind when it comes to indexing speeds. 8. The focus is all wrong The focus of Google and Bing couldn't be any different. Google attempts to find the best solutions to improve its search for users. It realizes that if users are happy, its profits will soar. And its recent financial statements have reflected that success. Microsoft's Bing search engine is much different. For one, Microsoft is focusing too much of its time and energy on what Google is doing. It also believes that the more content available in search results, the more people will like it. Microsoft must eventually realize that search is about users first and foremost if it wants to compete in that market. 9. Mobile integration Google's willingness to bring search to several mobile devices has significantly helped the company stay atop the search market. Google Search is the default service on the company's mobile operating system, Android OS. Even better, it's also the default search engine on the iPhone. In fact, only recently did Apple announce that Bing would also be offered as an option in the company's mobile operating system. Google's mobile integration has been extremely important to the company. Not only does it potentially expose more users to its service, it also keeps current users from trying out Bing. Until Microsoft makes a significant play for search in the mobile market, it will be hard-pressed to catch up to Google. 10. Information takes center stage As mentioned, Bing spends too much time with extras. But Google Search is different. Google's search page reveals everything users need to know about the company's strategy: Simplicity and information must trump all. It works. Although Google is starting to add more features to its search, it's still much simpler than any other service on the Web. Information matters most to Google, and its results-page design reflects that. Google is simply better at search than Bing right now. That doesn't mean Bing isn't worth trying out, but it does mean that from an experience perspective, it has a long way to go to match Google.",PRO,"It was only a few years ago when Microsoft finally woke up and realized that if it doesn't improve its standing in the search market, it could lose its profitability and be kept out of the Web. ...

Rather than accepting Telecinco's placement of the monitoring burden on YouTube, the federal court said that it was the copyright owners who had the responsibility to make sure that their content was not being distributed in an unwanted manner.

If you look at the image at link [3] you will see an image of a search made on Google images of the word pole, now of course you can imagine that some not so appropriate pictures came up, and if you look you will see that this search was made in moderate safe search. However I then proceeded to do the search under the ""strict"" criteria and still yet some inappropriate came up[4]. I then proceeded to do an image search for ""pole"" on Bing and as you can see in link [6] far less inappropriate images came up. Now as I assume that the first thing you are going to do in response to my position is to argue that I purposely searched a word that would come up with some pictures that you cant quite consider safe. So link [7] provides you with a search of the north pole. Link [8] provides you with a search of Mrs. Claus. Link [9] for the word hi. All of these done on Google with moderate safe search on.

Google is making changes that most of the users of Youtube have been and are expressing their distaste in. Google has mostly been ignoring every bit of criticizm and stubbornly refuses to change what they have done even when pressed about it. 2.) Google is effectively treating every single user on Youtube like criminals with their recent new copyright changes.

Large channels like MinnesotaBurns and Pewdiepie have started turning comments off in their videos along with Nerd Cubed, because of the problems they cause. 3.)

This quote, the #1 quote by a user under the name James Gandofini, was the #1 Comment on the Petition to change the comments back to their original form [1]. It is because I agree with many of the Reasons on this petition, and the negatives associated with this update, that I am in affirmation today. Let us start off with the reasons that this update is harmful 1. GOOGLE + MAKES IT INCREDIBLY HARD IN ORDER TO RETAIN an anonymous identity. Co-Founder of Youtube itself Jawed Karim himself Declared: """"Why the f*** do i need a google+ account to comment on a video?"" The fact of it is, Stripping the shelter to hide behind to be unknown if you have a google+ account already that you are forced to use. Note the following: Over 80% of Youtube users had a google+ before the update. [2] 2. The Google+ update Caused many Videos to be lost entirely [3][4] Many users lost content due to a 2-week recovery policy put in by the Google+ update, forcing them to switch. 3. Google+ Has caused Lost Notifications and other problems relating to it. [5] As Evidenced in the 2nd Video, and the comments of [1] and more, Youtube google+ Integration has not only cost convenience as evidenced in the video, but has completely lost some notifications, causing less of the interaction between channel operators and followers, with ripple effects such as lost subscribers and viewers as well as revenue. 4. Changes Regarding Length and links in comments have been removed. [6] For instance, the Link feature used has been taken down due to abuse. If abuse of the system of the update wasn't a harm, I do not know what the word harm means. In the Mean time, People are abusing the removal of the Character limit by posting movie scripts, ASCII art, and other spammy messages [7]. 5. Youtube new moderation Screws with messages with their ""spam"" filter. As seen in the Video above, it was nearly impossible to retrieve perfectly acceptable comments, which could amount to thousands of post of meaningful missing comments, a definite negative side effect, stifling the atmosphere of youtube Comments. 6. The Grandfather Clause means Millions of comments can now not be replied to [8] Simply stated and simple in meaning, no replies to old popular comments, or old comments at all, preventing much intellectual discourse, as well as stifling replies of the old system. 7. Features are not there due to new commenting system 2 Prominent Features of the old System Have been taken out, those being Seeing Info About users by hovering, and seeing both New and Relevant comments at the same time. [1] These features were great for convenience, and them being gone is now a major harm. 8. And Finally, Google+ Makes everything take longer. From Commenting to Sharing To nearly everything on youtube, it is hampered, obstructed, or blocked by the new update. The core that we love is still there, surrounded by the cold hard shell of the Google+ update. It is for these reasons and many more I ask for an Affirmative Vote in todays's Debate.

vegan,"Thank you for the great debate topic. Pro's definition of veganism is that of the ethical vegan, which is the orthodox side of veganism. Other types of veganism exist such as dietary veganism, where the reasons for becoming a vegan are more for personal health benefits rather than for the salvation of animals. http://en.wikipedia.org... I would class the dietary vegans in somewhat of a conservative or reformed type of veganism. Some ethical (orthodox) vegans do not like dietary vegans to be called real vegans because they aren't fully converted to the full vegan lifestyle. http://www.theveganwoman.com... You'll see me draw several parallels between veganism and religion in my arguments as I will show that vegansim is very much a type of religion. It's not a religion that touches the subject of God, but its a religion where the orthodox adherents must not waver in their vegan beliefs or actions unless they are to be ridiculed and excommunicated from the community of orthodox vegans. I hold that every person should have the freedom to do what they choose, live the life they want to live, and live with the positive or negative consequences of their decisions. Pro's argument is that ""people should become vegan because it is a better lifestyle, and that way we don't harm or kill animals."" In his argument, con did not specify which lifestyle he is comparing to veganism. I can only assume he meant that becoming a vegan is the best lifestyle over all other lifestyles until he states otherwise. Pro must also define what he means by ""people."" Should all people become vegan? Should a few, some, half, or most people become vegan? Should I become vegan? Should Pro himself become a vegan if he is not already?

I bet if I research some more, I would find alot more animals like these silkworms. My reasons for becoming vegan : 1) Its healthy. Obviously. Here you get to eat more vegetables and fruits. No fat. People wouldn't suffer from cholesterol, diabetes, strokes, and some cancers. Many people wouldn't die from heart problems. 2) Its kind. It is unnecessary to be killing animals in order to feed and clothe ourselves. Plants can keep us alive. Some slaughter houses, are really cruel to animals. http://www.youtube.com... 3) Better for the environment . Meat production uses up alt of land and water. Cows expel amounts of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Their hooves pack the dirt, making it less likely for it to absorb the rain. Manure from animal industrial facilities leaks into waterways, and gets into the groundwater. 4) Its delicious. People from all over the over the world have created plant-based dishes. Many familiar foods have a vegan versions, such as pizza, casserole, even chocolate cake!

vegan,"Resolved: Well planned vegan diets are healthier than their meat-based counterparts. Terms: Well planned diet: A diet which can be designed by a layperson with a reasonable amount of research Vegan (or plant-based) diet: A diet that excludes animal body parts, animal milk and eggs Healthier: Greater longevity and freedom from disease Meat-based (or animal-based) diet: A diet which regularly consists of animal products (body parts, animal milk and eggs) In this debate, I will argue that plant-based diets are healthier than meat-based diets. I will highlight the virtues of vegan diets and the vices of meat-based diets. My opponent will do the opposite; pointing out the flaws of a vegan diet and arguing in favor of a meat based one. This debate will be based on dietetic evidence obtained from modern, reputable scientific studies. Discussing what evolution ""designed"" us for or what our physiology ""proves"" we should eat can be interesting. However, I would encourage my opponent to base his or her arguments on modern dietetic science as I think this is more relevant to the resolution. During the debate I will point out the role animal-based foods play in cardiovascular disease, cancer, obesity and diabetes. I will respond to criticisms of well planned vegan diets as my opponent provides them. In this round I will begin with cardiovascular disease: World-wide, cardiovascular diseases such as ischemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease end more lives prematurely than anything else[1][2]. In North America, CVD accounts for 40% of all deaths[3]. The American Heart Association estimates that ""79,400,000 American adults (one in three) have one or more types of cardiovascular disease""[4]. Dietary cholesterol is only found in animal foods[5] and is not necessary for humans to consume as it is naturally produced by the liver[6][7]. Scientist estimate that for every 1% increase in cholesterol levels, the risk of heart disease raises by 2-3%[3]. Saturated fats, transfatty acids and dietary cholesterol are the most significant causes of hypercholesterolemia (elevated cholesterol levels)[3]. Of all dietary groups, vegans have the lowest levels of these substances in their blood[3]. Furthermore, the substances that mitigate hypercholesterolemia are soluble fiber, plant protein (especially soy protein), polyunsaturated fats and phytochemicals[3]. These substances are only found in plant foods and are, as a consequence, more abundant in vegans[3]. In summary, vegans have the lowest risk of developing cardiovascular disease; the leading cause of deaths. 1 http://en.wikipedia.org... 2 http://www.who.int... 3 http://books.google.com...

The Cummunist Manifesto “Let the guzzling classes tremble at a Cummunist revolution. The harlotarians have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to win. Working men of all countries, unite!” –Karl “Big Gulp” Marx The vegan ethos is motivated by the recognition that neither man nor beast may be made an object to be sucked dry by the ruling classes. Vegans see ethical worth in all sentient beings and so refuse to partake in the reification of animals. Meat and leather represent the coercive transformation of a sentient being into an object to be sold and consumed. Swallowing semen is consensual act- the sperm is willingly expelled from the body with joy and vigor. Barring fringe cases of prostitution, the vegan is not making the sperm donor an object to be bought and sold; the vegan is not reducing the sentient spewer to a piece of meat. Simply put, spunk ain’t a commodity. Oral sex and the eager lapping that follows is not only wholly within the ethical bounds of veganism, it solves the inequalities vegans object to. In his semenal work, Marx noted: “In proportion as the exploitation of one individual by another is put an end to, the exploitation of one nation by another will also be put an end to. In proportion as the antagonism between classes within the nation vanishes, the hostility of one nation to another will come to an end.” Swallowing is an act which bridges the divide between classes. It removes antagonism as the donor appreciates the moral fortitude of the vegan for finishing the job through to the end.",CON,"Definitions: Veganismis the practice of abstaining from the use of animal products, particularly in diet, as well as following an associated philosophy that rejects the commodity status of sentient animals "

vegan,"I've been kinda sorta vegan for about a year, and frankly, I hate it. I'd love to be convinced that I can throw this aside and go back to eating delicious things like cheese. Though full disclosure I haven't been able to force myself into a fully plant-based diet and have had a weekly cheat day. The spirit is willing but the flesh is weak and all that.

Things I consider facts:

* I **can** be vegan. I have time, money, access and health to make that choice.
* Animal suffering is bad.
* The environment damage and global warming is bad.
* Individuals must  be willing to make sacrifices for ethical reasons even if their contribution is small.

I won't get mad if you try to argue those but you're not likely to shift me on those basic principles. Health impact is already not a factor for me (I don't think being vegan is clearly healthier).

&amp;#x200B;

These facts  I could be wrong about or missing some key aspect of:

* Buying animal products directly supports a system that causes animal suffering.
* Buying animal products is harmful for the environment (relative to eating plants) because of emissions, water/land use, etc.

So my overall logic is that eating animal products harms the environment and animals, and that's a bad thing thing, I have the ability to avoid this bad thing, so I am obligated to avoid this bad thing. To do otherwise would be selfishly harming the world just for my pleasure.

vegan,"Meat eaters are not ignorant in my opinion. I am sure there are many biologists, gastroenterologists, vets, and pro animal rights people who eat meat, me falling under the last one. Being at least one of the things on the preceding list should disqualify ignorance as a reason for eating meat. Personally, I enjoy meat because of preference. I understand what happens on farms, factories, butcher shops, restaurants, etc with meat. More selfish? Well, what's selfish? Selfish seems to mean that one cares for one's self without any regards to others. I will agree that selfish is a proper word to use. Meat eaters take advantage of life on earth for personal gain and pleasure. However, we as humans are way past selfish all together. Anyone taking part in the industrial revolution and the results of it are selfish. We take advantage of earth and the things of it for our own personal gain or pleasure. We chop down trees, we dirty up water, we burn oil and coal, we dig and landscape every other acre of earth, we capture animals and genetically change them to be our fluffy pets instead of letting them roam free in the environment, we run over squirrels, and instead of eating food that grows from our surroundings, we destroy land that is already there, plant new plants that aren't natural to the area, and then they take the crops and turn them in to something more desired. Simply put, humans are selfish. We all do things that destroy the environment for our personal gain with little regards for the environment. So, we as humans are selfish and care less about others for our own personal reasons. If this debate is how vegans are better and smarter than meat eaters, than this debate is not a good idea. You and I (I'm assuming you're a vegan) are only different because of our eating choices. We are both, at the end of the day are selfish, less caring beings because we are humans.

vegan,"Thank you for your response. The argument I made about me being more selfish was meant to be taken on a very, very broad scale. If I do support the murder of fellow earthlings than yeah, I am selfish. BUT, and I'm not saying it's okay, but why do we draw the line at animals' living condition (current state of life)? Why don't we draw the line at destroying their habitats, using them for testing and using them for experiments? And if the line is drawn there as well, why is the only frontline of this battle? Why is vegan the start of it all? Animals who are not meant to eat meat would probably reject it when ingested, however, humans, whom are animals, do not reject it (actually, on some scale, I do. I have IBS but... another story another time). I know this area of this popular debate was not mentioned, I just wanted to throw that out there. I hope it can be understood that I am running on zero sleep right now and I am not 100% focused, so what may seem off topic or weird is just me typing with one eye closed. but my turn is almost up and I shall fight through. Something I want to cover is this pleasure. We are selfish, and we are eating at another's expense, but if we enjoy it, it boosts our morale and mental health. Mental health is an important part of anyone's overall health. Now, it's wrong to seek this pleasure in the form of murder (I think murder is the incorrect word for this and I will explain why soon) in my opponent's eyes, however, because it was introduced to us, it is hard to go back. Now about that murder: murder seemes to be a word meaning unjustified killing. Meat is justifiable. At this point, having had captured and farmed so many animals for so long, many farm animals have genetically changed over time to depend largly on humans, making life hard for them if they were free. We as humans let them live a pretty good life before meeting it's end. My point is, it would take a lot of years to reverse what we have done, and it would also destroy the first world (and some lesser) economies.

The nutrients tend to be low in saturated fat, high in fiber and packed with antioxidants, which in some cases lessens the chances of obesity, heart disease, diabetes and cancer. Secondly the Production of meat places a heavy burden on the environment. The feeding of the animals and the transportation of the product is a hefty impact on the environment. Also the carbon footprint is increased because of the methane flatulence from cattle farming. For humanity veganism is the sustainable option when it comes to our planet.

nuclear energy,"I'm in favour for nuclear energy. For economical reasons, nuclear energy has strong benefits. Like my opponent said, nuclear power plants are expensive to build and we need to use energy for building it. But the main mistake that we make is we are looking too close to this subject. Nuclear power plant is an energy source which can give us highly more energy then others. If we compare a nuclear power plant with thermal power plant, we can clearly see that nuclear energy will gain us what we lost while we're building the centrals. And the ending of the fossil fuels are really close(1). We're dependent on thermal power and fuels so nuclear energy will be a useful hand of help. For environmental reasons, nuclear energy has many radioactive wastes. But I think that we can agree on something: The worlds most important problem is Global Worming. It will destroy us slowly. And that's why we're our children to be careful and be aware of the effects of global warming. Now whit this fabulous energy type, we have a chance to and the global warming. For the effects of nuclear power plants, I need you to know that 95% of the energy generated by nuclear burn up is without any waste of CO2. So we should use nuclear energy to stop our biggest problem in the world. For the risks, Nuclear radiation is risky but the radiation will leave the central only if there is a crack in the central. We had seen it in Chernobyl, but now, we have a better technology and better scientist. We need to trust on our people to make this energy useful. Secondly., radiation is an important factor but we can't prove that the cancer is caused by the nuclear radiation. Of course it will effect the human health but ,we, people experience a lot of technological devices in our daily lives, like phones or televisions. Are we going to get rid of them just because of radiation? And the cancers are highly caused because of portable telephones, especially(2).

nuclear energy,"In my opinion Nuclear Energy is necessary for countries. Before we discuss on energy or environmental effects, we need to make sure that nuclear energy is possible to use for all the countries. Of course, that will happen with money. When we look closer, nuclear energy makes a lot of difference in our world of economy. But if we look generally, it will gain us what we lost. Because the energy which is made by thermal power plant is a lot lesser than the nuclear energy. So we can say that the centrals of nuclear power is cost a lot but the energy we gain with that will equal the difference. Now for the environmental effects. Nuclear Energy isn't polluting the world as thermal power plants. Thermal energy causes the global warming which is the most important world discussion and the most dangerous natural disaster of our generation. There is not any carbon dioxide pollution with nuclear energy. So this energy do not emit harmful gases. Nuclear energy is an emission-free energy source because it does not burn anything to produce electricity. It does not cause any ground-level ozone formation, smog, and acid rain like thermal power plants.(1) I think that if we can use an energy type which harms our environment a lot and which does not produce enough energy as nuclear power, why can't we use nuclear power? Nuclear energy has a lot of risks, it is true and everybody knows it but in my opinion, mankind did a lot of dangerous things. We can't improve ourselves without taking risks. We are going to learn our mistakes for the future generations. We can look at Chernobyl disaster. The disaster really caused a lot of radioactive waste. But noting will work perfectly with the first try. The main risk of the nuclear power is the nuclear weapons. So if we stop using them, there is not any fatal risks. You can ask that ""if the reactor explodes.."", but the technology we use in past and in present, there is a huge difference between them. We can know and control what our abilities to do with nuclear powers. If we compare the energy made by thermal and nuclear, we will understand the difference. Of course there is renewable energy plants like solar or hydro but these are not making enough energy as nuclear power. A typical reactor of uranium convert 500.000mj/kg but for oil the number is just 45-46mj/kg(2). Also,we have to use 2 million grams of oil or 3 million grams of coal to equal the power contained in 1 gram of uranium fuel(3). To sum up, Nuclear energy is necessary for all the countries and it is likely more useful then other types of power plants. I wish my best lucks to my opponent 1.http://www.fi.edu... 2.http://www.world-nuclear.org... 3.http://occupywallst.org...",PRO,Thermal energy causes the global warming which is the most important world discussion and the most dangerous natural disaster of our generation. ...

nuclear energy,"Sorry for the argument delay. My final argument is more about risks. Before talking about the risks, we can say that Nuclear power plants cost a lot for building them but it will recover energy and regain the money we lost. Nuclear power plants produce highly more energy then other energy plants. For the risks, I want to quote from the subject which is ""Nuclear Energy for COUNTRIES"". In Europe there are 185 nuclear centrals (Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Russian Federation, UK...)(1) And I would like to remind you that every thermal or nuclear power plant can explode or pollute the world. So If we are arguing about countries, and we are, we need to look to the subject from another point of view. Imagine that you are a president of a country which exists in Europe and which doesn't have any nuclear power plant. But the country still has risks because of the other countries nuclear centrals. So that country has the risks of nuclear damage but not from their nuclear centrals, from different countries nuclear centrals. So that country can build their own centrals and use them. We can't demand other countries to close their centrals because, like France, Nuclear energy is their biggest energy sources (France: 58nuclear reactors, 63,130 MWe)(2) Moreover; Nuclear energy is a prove that science is still advancing. If we say no to this wonderful gift of science, we will stop the evolution of science. Don't stop the Nuclear Energy for future generations...

The power plant cannot be placed in any urban area due one simply needs to see japan to now why or Chernobyl but even then a spill can contaminate for miles in any direction. Furthermore We are still fighting a ""war on terror"" this makes nuclear power plant high risk. So the power plant cannot be built anywhere in the coasts or near faults or in high density areas that leaves the rural areas however it cannot be placed there either because if there is a spill the people there loose their source of income and maybe thier lives due to human error. C2 -cost- nuclear power plant construction costs—mainly materials, labor, and engineering—rose by 185 percent between 2000 and 2007. More recently, costs have been increasing even faster: In mid-March, Progress Energy informed state regulators that the twin 1,100 MW nuclear plants it intends to build in Florida would cost $14 billion, which ""triples estimates the utility offered little more than a year ago."" Jim Harding, former director of power planning and forecasting for Seattle City Light, estimates that nuclear plants constructed today would provide electricity at between 12 and 17 cents per kilowatt-hour. To put this cost into perspective, the average U.S. electricity price in 2006 was 8.9 cents per kWh, and well-placed wind turbines can produce electricity for less than 5 cents per kWh. So nuclear power actally costs more than wind or water power. C3 - investment - Subsidies for nuclear reactors wouldn't subsidize nuclear technology—they would subsidize the nuclear industry. Congress should fund research of clean, alternative energy technologies that promise to rival fossil fuels in cost—without subsidies. Congress should also provide tax credits that would make such technologies cheaper by encouraging production and moving them down the experience curve. Such support would encourage a growing American industry and create American jobs. By squandering our limited resources on subsidies for the nuclear power industry, the United States is missing an extraordinary opportunity. C4 - Waste - Where is all the waste going to go? nuclear power generates toxic waste never mind that america hasn't really built one in over thirty years and never mind that japan steel is the only company which produces the central part of a nuclear reactor containment vessel. All the waste generated by uranium/plutonium ( and we don't have vry much uranium so availability is also a problem) will go in big containers and be buried in the earth which is sort of ironic because nuclear energy is supposedly clean. Conclusion: The united states federal gov't should not invest in nuclear power sources because of lack of understanding nuclear power plants, there is no viable location of where to put nuclear reactors, They would be high risk targets for terrorists, an investment in them would not be wise, and there would be a generation of waste and the availability of uranium is another problem as well. Thank you for this debate.",CON,"More recently, costs have been increasing even faster: In mid-March, Progress Energy informed state regulators that the twin 1,100 MW nuclear plants it intends to build in Florida would cost $14 billion, which ""triples"
donald trump,"Who is this man ""Trump."" There have been several articles posted on the internet lately that suggest that Donald Trump isn't who he is portraying himself to be, as real conservative republican. In a REDSTATE ARTICLE for instance the author of the article states,""The Bible says not to put new Christians in leadership positions. I don""t think the conservative movement should put new conservatives in leadership positions either. Let them be sure what they believe first."" In the same article its stated that Donald Trump has been a contributor to the democrat party and organizations that conservatives were against so that certainly raises the question about who Donald trump reallty is Some have suggested that Donald trump is a spoiler taking away votes that could have gone to another republican candidate running for president who is a more known conservative ruining the republicans chances of winning the White House. Donald Trump covers himself by saying that he was a businessman and as such, he gave money to a lot of different causes and people, that was the way business was done. Isn't the reason that Donald Trump is gaining so much support is because the conservatives and republicans in general are becoming fed up with the way the ""Good old boys, ""/ Establishment republicans, and establishment democrats, have been doing business as usual in Washington. Maybe though the Conservative republicans think that those who have been elected to office weren't listening to conservatives and independents and haven't been for a long time and are now willing to take a chance that Donald Trump will listen to them and will promote the things that conservatives believed in. Betting on Donald Trump to be the conservatives and independents friend is a gamble, only time will tell whether the gamble paided off,if Donald trump actually believed in what he said that he believed in. Donald Trump is saying what conservatives and independents wanted to hear, but is it a businessman just doing business and saying what he thinks will sell, again, only time will provide the answer, we can only hope that Donald Trump doesn't turn out to be a spoiler and allow Hillary or some other democrat to be elected to office. The conservative and independents are tired of being lied to , we can only hope that Donald Trump isn't just mouthing the words that the conservatives and independents wanted to hear and actually meant what he's been saying",PRO,In the same article its stated that Donald Trump has been a contributor to the democrat party and organizations that conservatives were against so that certainly raises the question about who Donald trump reallty is Some have

Definitions Sith- ancient kratocratic organization wielding the dark side of the Force, typically using crimson lightsabers and attempting to achieve great power. Kratocratic- government by those who are strong enough to seize power through force or cunning. Arguments Donald Trump wishes to achieve great power- One of the objectives of the Sith is to overthrow the weak, take its place, and rule with absolute unobstruction. Donald Trump, as everyone is aware of, is running for president of the United States- the highest position of power in the government. Donald Trump has taken many jabs at our current leadership, as well as other weaker candidates such as Lindsey Graham and Rick Perry. He is attempting to tear down the weaker candidates and take the position of ultimate power. Donald Trump hates Mexicans- Donald Trump's criticism of Mexico and their immigrants have been the source of much controversy. Sith lords despise their enemy, the Jedi. The Jedi are wielders of the light side of the Force. They are peaceful and pacifist. Donald Trump's asinine claims about Mexican criminals being ""rapists"" and ""murderers"" are akin to the Sith's attempts to criminalize the Jedi near the fall of the Old Republic.

Pro's argument is not backed by the text in Donald's statement. Furthermore, changing from a racist policy to a non-racist policy later does not make his original policy non-racist, nor does it make Donald not-racist. Finally, Pro has not address my argument at all, and it still stands. - Donald Trump campaigned on a policy to prevent specifically Muslims from entering the United States, which is discriminatory against Muslims. - Donald Trump campaigned to discriminate against Muslims. - Discrimination against Muslims is internationally recognized as a form of racism -> Donald Trump campaigned using racism -> Donald Trump is racist.",CON,Then Pro attempts to dispute this statement as being racist using two different tactics. ... #1 Pro implies that this policy is somehow not racist because it would be limited in duration.

donald trump,"I would like to bring attention to some factors that I believe were important in Donald Trump's victory, that will likely not be present in the 2020 elections. First, Trump’s opponent, Hillary Clinton, was also very unpopular. For most of the campaign she too was below 50% popularity. This shows in some of the closest states in the 2016 election: Michigan--0.3%, New Hampshire--0.4%, Wisconsin--1%, Pennsylvania--1.2%, and so on. Two unpopular candidates led to very close margins. However, when we look at Trump’s approval rating, for the most part he has gotten less and less popular since winning the Presidency. There’s been a minor uptick in popularity, but he’s had similar short term fluctuations previously. Meanwhile it cannot be assumed that the Democratic challenger will be as unpopular as Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump. So what we are likely to see is that while Donald Trump enters the 2020 election with even lower popularity than in 2016, his opponent will likely enter with higher popularity than Hillary Clinton. With the razor thin margins Trump won by in several states, such a shift could easily give the state to the Democrats. Related is that Hillary Clinton was under a very public investigation throughout the election. That, along with the last minute revelation of the investigation restarting also hurt her chances in the general election. In effect in the 2016 election, Donald Trump was running on easy mode against a candidate that even a majority her own party didn’t like or trust, yet still just barely beat out his opponent in multiple states. Against a more popular and trusted candidate, Donald Trump is highly unlikely to win in 2020. https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com... http://abcnews.go.com... http://abcnews.go.com...",PRO,"I would like to bring attention to some factors that I believe were important in Donald Trump's victory, that will likely not be present in the 2020 elections.  ...
