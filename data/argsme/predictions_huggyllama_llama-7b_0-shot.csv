"On this assessment, the evidence points to a current natural climate change which happens sequentially in two main climate periods, icehouse and warmhouse." Another study was found on the Vostok ice cores, which show temperature records going back over 400,000 years. Data from the ice cores reveal an 800 year lag of CO2 behind temperature [2], meaning CO2 changes came AFTER temperature. If climate change was man made, then temperature would lag behind CO2, but the opposite happens, which proves that CO2 cannot influence temperature. The ice cores also show that the temperature rose to about the same level whenever it rose significantly, which shows that it is a constant cycle and not affected by human activities. The same can be said about the CO2 levels. Manipulation and False Activism Pollutes the Climate Change Debate One of the biggest science scandals, Climategate, occurred in 2009. Hackers stole emails from scientists at the East Angelia Climatic Research Unit, and statements from the emails contradict anthropogenic climate change. [3].

Finally, Former Vice President Al Gore made a famous movie called "An Inconvenient Truth" about the theory of man made global warming and its effects. However, there were eleven significant errors in his movie, coming from Gore trying to exaggerate in attempt to scare people into believing his political agenda. So what could be the cause of the global warming? I believe the sun is the one responsible, as correlations between the sun and the Earth's temperature have been found when studying temperature and sun levels from 1880-1980 [11], and 1980-2006 [12]. This could also explain why other planets in our solar system are warming, as all the planets rely on the Sun. But at the end of the day, the warming is NOT caused by CO2.

7	 A study by the biology cabinet shows no relationship between CO2 and temperature [1]. This is supported by other studies, which showed that over the course of 20,000 years the air in the Vostok Icicle Core froze, thereby entrapping atmospheric gases that would include any CO2 trapped there at the time the cores were extracted, and no changes to this core was made during extraction [2]. Such gases include atmospheric CO2, methane, and the like, which is easily measured today by simply pulling a core out of the earth's core. There is in fact a lag between CO2 and temperature of about 800 years, meaning that temperature changes before CO2, not vice versa [3]. These last facts exclude the possibility that the temperature change is a result of human action [4]." Due to my ignorance, I didn't realize that multiple speeches were uploaded in one round, so I don't think I'm going to be able to complete the round. I'll withdraw. I like it. It was enlightening to learn that so many things have to do with the Sun. Pro will have to negate the individual responses from the counterplan, however I don't see how the fact that CO2 levels lag behind temperature proves that man doesn't affect temperature. Not the greatest scholarly source. It is interesting to note that the recent research seems to align with those who believe that human activity has caused warming, who have found the study to be "largely consistent with their view that the last few decades of warming were largely human-caused. Again, both are sources questioning the legitimacy of climate change skeptics Assigns blame to Al Gore Good speech. I concede and declare the final judge. I concede and declare the final judge. I declare voting open and vote Con @Cody, is it possible for you to split your speech? I couldn't finish it in one go, and I have to go at 30 minutes from now. If you can and if you want to, I can vote for you in what I've read of the speech. If not, I won't vote, obviously, so don't post in advance if you can't do so. I liked the comparison to anti-vaxxers. The real issue with the anti-vaxxers is the risks that come from inadequately vaccinated individuals. It seems like you're extending the concept of anti-vaxxers further. "I'm anti-religion, so please don't invite me over for Easter." A 220-year record of the earth's temperature, versus 400,000 years of the icecore and its 800 year lag makes the relationship very obvious What do methane and volcanism have to do with anything? The assumption that temperature cannot be affected by human activity is illogical The assumption that CO2 levels determine the Earth's temperature is illogical The scientists did not say that the recent studies showed that human activity did not affect the Earth's temperature 1. http://www.biocab.org......

In recent decades scientist say that there has been a loss of 1/3 of the glaciers that 1960's Scientist had discovered, nothing more needs to be said to prove the point. (4) There is a substantial amount of money and power going into the global warming movement, many scientist are receiving a good income through grants for research and experiments that do not uphold the claims of "Climate Change", and also lobbying groups such as WWF and Greenpeace are making a big profit through endless funding for legislative and educational groups that are set up to reduce carbon dioxide through taxes, and limit the fossil fuels that we depend on. (5)Energy experts say that "Climate Change" is a large factor to blame for increased prices in energy, If a international "compromise" were to be reached, with binding agreements and mandatory emission limits on countries, world governments could possibly make a substantial reduction in energy use at a substantial price.

15	 R2 Scientific consensus exists on the reality of anthropogenic climate change. Man-made climate change has already claimed human lives and continues to do so. Climate scientists have repeatedly tried to make this clear. Man-made climate change has already claimed human lives and continues to do so. It is time for the rest of us to listen. The consensus that humans are causing recent global warming is shared by 90%–100% of publishing climate scientists according to six independent studies by co-authors of this paper. ementevez, I will concede my opponent's point 1. The next three points would continue to make their points respectively, and my first point would have been irrelevant anyway. Also my first round continues as if you conceded point 1. 2. My first point stands as if you concede the argument. "Scientists have never come to an agreement about whether or not mankind is destroying planet Earth." This is a fairly inaccurate representation of your opposition's position. Such a debate could be phrased as follows: "Whether or not mankind is destroying planet Earth." It's possible to accept that proposition as it stands while still rejecting both the conclusion and, indeed, the premises. The opponent could believe that mankind is destroying the planet but that God will intervene in order to save it. The opponent might also believe that the issue is irrelevant to theology. If such a proposition is debatable, then it constitutes a valid argument. "Even if it is ultimately established that mankind is actively destroying planet Earth, this does not change the realities of the debate. It only means that there are a variety of possible remedies to the destruction of Earth." The only opponent who would claim that we cannot currently do anything to save the planet from destruction has already lost this debate. Those who hold such a view must already accept that we must repent of our sins and repent of our faithlessness towards God. This is what apologists call the first step, although they tend to call it'repentance'. Whether or not other things need to be done is a secondary matter and they have agreed to that debate in advance. Your opponent is accused of an equivocation: choosing between A and not-A to suit his argument. A perverse understanding of this point could allow the opponent to respond: "God will save us; A is therefore true." This is technically valid but it misses the point. It's true that God could create a tree in the middle of our solar system tomorrow and destroy it by the next day but that still wouldn't show that no god exists: it would show that that particular god is a God of lies. We're asking whether mankind is acting in a way that's harmful to itself, not whether mankind is as important to the gods as it thinks it is. I must admit that this rebuttal is not particularly strong. A mildly cautious mankind would conclude that its actions can have, at best, no long-term effect. A greedy mankind might hope that this state of affairs remains unchanged for a few centuries to come. A mankind less greedy might wonder what's actually going to happen when the last bit of oil runs out. These are not so very different views: if anything, the more greedy you are, the less greedy you appear to the next generation because you will have already begun to recover from your excesses. 3. You must point out the fallacy that my opponent is committing. Mankind is not proven to be destroying planet Earth. At most, my opponent is only trying to convince my audience that I am incorrect about mankind. That is not the point of my argument. Mankind not destroying planet Earth is irrelevant to the debate, even if it is ultimately established that mankind is actively destroying planet Earth. This is because my opponent's position hinges not on whether or not mankind is destroying planet Earth, but whether or not the universe should save itself. Either way, my opponent's view is not reliable since his system of belief rests upon the assumption of pluralisticism. The First Step of repentance in the Christian apolog

[0] Man-made climate change has already claimed human lives and continues to do so. [1] "the French civil security service has recorded 12,106 excess deaths between 16 and 22 August 2003." [2] "however, the trend in annual mortality from 1950 to 1980 exhibits a smaller slope that the one found between 1980 and 2005." [3] "Of all disease burdens, infectious diseases are likely to be the ones most sensitive to climate, and one particularly worrisome trend is the growth in rates of invasive bacterial diseases that are resistant to multiple classes of drugs (antibiotics). Avoiding antibiotic overuse is a major factor in this rising trend." [4] The consensus that humans are causing recent global warming is shared by 90%–100% of publishing climate scientists according to six independent studies by co-authors of this paper. Those results are consistent with the 97% consensus reported by Cook et al. [4] Of the few that dissent, few dissent from the obvious truth that the global climate is indeed changing, only that the warming portion of this change is likely to be both benign and minimal. In short, these dissenters are not 'deniers', but rather realists who take the precautionary principle to mean to do nothing unless we have clear evidence that an action poses a clearly larger, and substantially damaging, risk, especially when no benefit is clearly due. Man-made climate change is a real issue, but it’s in the infancy of study at best, and would benefit from responsible measures of regulation (regulate their cite), rather than reliance on the consensus to support such policies. We must be able to make our decisions based on the evidence we have. Rated by 64 users, with 47 positive, 8 neutral and 9 negative feedbacks The debate has ended.

In this paper, Hansen and his co-authors explain that a major reason why computer modelled predictions for global temperatures are so alarmist (see video below) is because we simply use too much aerosol particles in our calculations. For the past decade, many researchers have criticized previous climate change predictions. Hansen says that the former greenhouse gas model predictions were simply too low, saying "they accounted for too little aerosols". James Hansen, along with 16 other researchers, claims that by incorporating aerosol particles in their modeling, the global warming predictions have been grossly underestimated. Such extreme claims overshadow more realistic projections. You can see the impact this change will have on temperatures: As seen, when

25	 The consensus is that anthropogenic climate change is the cause of climate change, this is supported by the scientific studies that show the factual existence of anthropogenic climate change. We could classify the studies in three categories. The first category includes the studies which used the observed variations of conditions, attributes, or events and infers that human influence has affected their occurrence (Pielke, P, 2014). The second category includes the studies using theoretical and empirical evidence to determine that a model using human caused carbon dioxide concentration as an input factor would simulate a trend that matched the observed temperature trend, for example, (Oreskes, N, 2004, Skeptical environmentalist chapter 4). The last category is about studies which involved climatological observations such as boreholes, air bubbles trapped in ice, glaciers and tree ring evidence of temperature changes (Cook, J., Shiklomanov, I., et al, 2013). Countering the consensus argument, it is obvious that the scientific community is not a representative democracy like political democracy. If in the voting community, climate change deniers would predominate, they would still contribute to the scientific consensus. Although I concede the scientific community is a representative democracy to a great extent because the most authoritative journals in various fields publish articles that reach consensus regarding a particular topic. That is, the papers appear only after a careful review by experts in the field, and thus have an extremely low rate of publishing. It also means that it is not subject to a vote where the majority is always right, but rather a group of reviewers made up of many scientists. At any rate, this may well be the special case of expertise and gives rise to consensus in science. In addition, scientists are not always wrong; maybe because society can't resolve their disputes within the scientific community? Maybe society rejects scientific advances and treats the scientific consensus as a trash on a higher level. Similarly, major changes have occurred in the climate before, including the Ice Age, even before that and the Cambrian explosion. So, the scientific consensus that climate change is the result of the human intervention is logical, because this consensus would contradict the counter evidence and would ultimately undermine this theory and would challenge their own models that support the theory. No consensus is absolute and has proven to be wrong, especially in the recent scientific developments regarding whether man-made climate change exists. Look at the period from 1915 to 1940, when our forefathers believed the climate was getting colder. Everyone spoke of a new ice age because of the little ice age. The arctic ice actually expanded up to 20% during this period. It became a consensus among the scientific community that climate was becoming colder at that time; this was a consensus during the early 20th century. Scientists also believed that the warming in the end of 20th century to the beginning of 21st century did not exist (figure 1). Look at the climate during the previous two hundred years. We had two global temperature peaks in 1930 and 2000, maybe you've heard about it? If there was a major global warming from the 1800s to 1930s, did mankind increase greenhouse gases rapidly during that period or have we been increasing our greenhouse gas emissions rapidly in the last two decades? In fact, our generation did not cause these temperature fluctuations, but we are sure we do when it comes to rising temperatures because the cause is again carbon dioxide. If it is impossible to prove that rising temperatures are not due to human influence then it is impossible to prove that falling temperatures are not due to human influence as well. For the period from 1930-1940, warming occurred as shown in figure 1. After all, no one knows what will happen tomorrow; researchers on the contrary predict what will happen in the next few decades. That is, the scientific consensus must be accepted. The scientific consensus is based on some studies in the scientific community and is subjective. But if there are such studies that indicate climate change is not driven by anthropogenic activity, the scientific consensus should be broken. So far, those scientists who support the hypothesis of anthropogenic climate change are very well respected, educated and focused. The number of scientists who challenge the issue is still very
26	 Extremely likely means at least a 95% chance of being true. As a scientist, I believe we should approach the question of anthropogenic climate change with as objective and scientific an outlook as possible. Extremely likely means at least a 95% chance of being true. The evidence is overwhelming and the faulty analysis by my opponent stands in the way of reaching a true scientific consensus. A scientific consensus exists on the reality of anthropogenic climate change. Here is a summary of the evidence from my opponent: I will now explain why this summary is faulty, so that we do not reach the false conclusion that man-made climate change is not happening. Climate scientists have repeatedly tried to make this clear. "It is time for the rest of us to listen." [1] Man-made climate change has already claimed human lives and continues to do so. [2] [3] Man-made climate change has already caused a net increase of deaths of 15,000 and perhaps is claiming even more lives, hence, it is causing extreme deaths. The warming trend caused by CO2 is extremely likely and it is by far the most significant driver of climate change. It has caused no net increase in deaths but has instead increased crop yields worldwide and makes many ecosystems more resilient to natural disasters. It is also the beneficial driver that has resulted in large decreases in deaths due to air pollution. Man-made climate change has the potential to save lives if we approach the problem with an open mind and scientific understanding. This is not a pro-carbon tax or pro-marginal tax increase on CO2 utilization argument. It is an argument that helps the poorest of the poor get out of poverty by limiting dangerous environmental shocks (floods, droughts, other natural disasters). Furthermore, it limits the worst impacts of climate change that could be fatal, regardless of their ethnicity or whether they live in some poverty. Man-made climate change is a civilizational threat. This is a public health policy decision that needs to be addressed by the U.S. Government. My opponent provides 3 PNGs, which were my argument and were cut to fit it into a single image. The provided image is extremely misleading since it excludes one of my biggest points in that Summary and relies too heavily on the garbage in garbage out test. This system cannot determine the age of a document using the age of it's authors. That is not a legitimate argument for the age of the concept of anthropogenic climate change. Even WSJ and Cato have published older pieces saying that climate scientists find the evidence "extremely convincing". My opponent is more concerned about being on a winner's list than the truth of the concept of anthropogenic climate change. My opponent is extremely biased and twists the science for his own point of view. The top scientists in the field do not find that there is less than a 95% chance that human-generated greenhouse gases are driving global warming. The aforementioned paper is biased, especially since there were so few skeptical opinions to come from. He cites an article from "Climate Depot", where "Climate Depot" is a document written by global warming denier Marc Morano. One of the "experts" he cites is not recognized by the International Panel on Climate Change. His answer is extremely pro-coal, even suggesting that the government consider building the Keystone Pipeline. He is a partisan of the industry that would greatly benefit from doing what my opponent suggests. He cites "97% of climate scientists agree" as proof of his point. Here is a quote from his article: "In a commentary, climate scientist Dr. Robert Davis of Lancaster University states: "Forget the dubious 97% claim. Just go and read the papers and you will find a wide range of opinion. Some think humans have no influence at all. Some think they have a large influence. Only a tiny minority think that humans have some influence but that influence is very large."" [2] My opponent believes the conclusion based on the method. His argument that there is not consensus on anthropogenic climate change is a red herring and contains a host of factual errors. First, the IPCC consists of over a 1000 climate scientists, not the scientific community as a whole

A scientific consensus exists on the reality of anthropogenic climate change. But there is a scientific consensus on the reality of anthropogenic climate change. Climate scientists have repeatedly tried to make this clear. It is time for the rest of us to listen." [1] The observed increase in GHG emissions is overwhelmingly anthropogenic and its effect has been and continues to be scientifically measurable. [2] It is now scientifically certain that the rise in global GHG emissions since the industrial revolution is as a direct result of human activity [3] Climate scientists have repeatedly tried to make this clear. It is time for the rest of us to listen. [4] The observed increase in GHG emissions is overwhelmingly anthropogenic and its effect has been and continues to be scientifically measurable [5] The observed increase in GHG emissions is overwhelmingly anthropogenic and its effect has been and continues to be scientifically measurable. " The hiatus (lull) in surface temperature rise since the late 1990s has led some skeptics to question whether the influence of anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions on climate is growing or decreasing. Based on observed changes in global mean surface air temperature, heat content, and sea level rise, we conclude that the rate of observed warming over the past 15 y has been sufficiently large to outpace the slow response time of the climate system to external forcings. This is consistent with external (exogenous) forcing by increasing GHG and aerosol emissions from human activities and other long-term trends that tend to warm the climate." [1] "Compared with preindustrial time, an increasing greenhouse effect has caused a 0.74 ± 0.18 K (0.43 ± 0.10 °C) increase in surface air temperature over land and 0.65 ± 0.13 K (0.39 ± 0.09 °C) over the ocean. This difference is taken here to reflect an increase of the effective radiating level of 17.6 ± 0.6 μm−2K−1, where μm−2 is Stefan's constant and −18 is the emissivity of the Earth's clear-sky surface. Global mean surface warming exhibits a large interannual variability, primarily due to the influence of the tropical Pacific Ocean. Decadal-scale internal variability associated with the Pacific decadal oscillation and other modes of variability mask longer time scales. Internal variability dominates the lull in global warming that took place from about 1998 to 2012. Taking time-varying decadal global mean surface temperature anomalies over land and ocean, trends in each decade for 1900–2012 are 0.107 ± 0.018 K yr−1 (0.33 ± 0.02 °C yr−1) and 0.156 ± 0.026 K yr−1 (0.54 ± 0.04 °C yr−1), respectively." [2] "Satellite data provides an independent check on the atmospheric temperature trend (Hansen et al. 2005). A recent analysis of this data (Karl et al. 2015) concludes that the 5-year running average of the global lower troposphere temperature (LTT) shows an increase of 0.114 ± 0.008 °C per decade over the period 1979–2013, and the 30-year smoothed global LTT shows an increase of 0.143 ± 0.010 °C per decade." [3] "Ocean heat content has continued to increase over the past decade, albeit with lesser extent than surface warming.

29	 R2 Response: It isn’t a fallacy, it is the nature of evidence to change in this way. Like resolutions, this isn’t a debate format, neither will I be penalized if evidence is used incorrectly. The ball is in Pro’s court to rebut or counter counter that evidence, failure to do so or he continues to use it, the mod will grant me another point for spelling/grammar. If that is the case I will reorganize my arguments into affirmations and negation of my negation. However it should be noted that Pro has failed to specify an affirmation or negation on the topic of whether AGW is real or not, thus I’ll refrain from doing so as well. Nor is there enough time to be confident that some of these counter C&P have already been presented by the Pro. C&P information has no bearing on the resolution of man-made climate change is real. Anything less than abiotic climate change would still make the opponent correct, as all things in the universe are natural. The pro is proceeding to answer a point with itself. The consensus is that man-made climate change is real, not that the consensus agrees man-made climate change is real. The pro is trying to base their resolution on an appeal to authority which this side already pointed out is a fail. Climate scientists have repeatedly tried to make this clear.

Climate scientists have repeatedly tried to make this clear. It is time for the rest of us to listen." [0] " led by my opponent to present his case during the last round of his argument. Here I would like to bring to the attention of the readers that the resolution presented by the former opponent and previous argument of my opponent, now in fourth round, is the fallacy of proving a fact when an opponent states that there is no evidence. The only evidence I’ve presented for one side has been that there is a scientific consensus. In no way have I proceeded with claims that the effects are necessarily going to be seen immediately or that he denies this. For those of you that I am actually trying to prove it already exists, my argument of my opponent to dismantle is that I have not personally come forward with his argument that science is unsound to contradict it. If science is wrong, it is on my opponent to prove it. I have only tried to dismantle his argument based on the known facts. My opponent attempts to discredit my other works by trying to show that there is no consensus. I have in my brief already shown that there is that consensus exists. In no way is my opponent allowed to produce any work to suggest that consensus doesn’t exist. This is my opponent’s fallacy and he can’t prove otherwise. Secondly, my opponent suggests that the public are naive enough to believe that science can only support man-made climate change. This is absolutely false. I have already shown that there is evidence of the earth having a temperature when the intensity of carbon emissions have been lower or vice-versa. Any logical and reasonable person knows that the symptoms of anthropogenic climate change can be experienced in the past, and we know what their results were. Hence, it is time for us to act because the situations of the past were detrimental to the continuation of human life. My opponent comes forward again to quote claims without sound evidence of any side. He claims that there is no consensus among scientists; however he doesn’t produce any evidence for this. Therefore, I will state that there is a consensus about anthropogenic climate change as I already have. My opponent cannot disprove that statement. My opponent also comes forward to argue that my sources are inaccurate in some way. However, his opposition to my last source doesn’t prove that science is wrong or that there is not a consensus. Lastly, my opponent shows that heat waves or warming generally doesn’t equal anthropogenic climate change. This is his fallacy in the argument. However, my opponent has already stated that he is against anthropogenic climate change. The information I have produced is enough to show that climate change is occurring. Therefore, to prove anything additional would be wasted effort. I challenge my opponent in the next round to give me evidence to prove that there is no consensus or that his evidence to the contrary will resolve this debate for me. I would like to thank my opponent for the debate and thank everyone who has read through the last three rounds. Vote Con. Posted by cleaneded 3 years ago My opponent makes the mistake of believing the resolution requires presenting evidence beyond the scientific consensus. He has failed to prove that the scientific consensus is incorrect. Thanks again to the voters who have read this far. There will be two more rounds at least. Thank you to the judge. Let's break the issues for this round in to three parts. Since this debate is hinging on the resolution "A scientific consensus exists on the reality of anthropogenic climate change," we would like to know: Is a consensus in science established by consensus? People sometimes think it is, but it isn't. From peer reviewed Medical Hypothesis.

"Due to the tension over the Arctic ice cap my opponent has accused me of strawmanning the debate over the reality of anthropogenic climate change. Since this accusation was launched by my opponent and that he strawmanned the debate over the reality of anthropogenic climate change, that becomes my sole burden of proof that he did. The burden of proof shifts to my opponent and he loses the debate by default of his poor form. No amount of argument or explanation can change that fact. In order to avoid this charge for his lack of readiness my opponent should improve his part of the debate by citing valid sources and being coherent in his writings. Here is some text: [0] Man-made climate change has already claimed human lives and continues to do so. But there is a scientific consensus on the reality of anthropogenic climate change.

[1] This report covers the period August 4 to 18, 2003 which ended in a heat wave in the middle of August and the authors of the report believe that the heat wave was due to the global warming caused by the greenhouse effect. The study did not have a clue how global warming works." [2] "The association between climate change and the frequency and intensity of extreme heat events is now well established.

[3] Even among the public, strong majorities recognize that global warming is due to human activity. In a recent survey, 68% of respondents said they were very or somewhat certain of this attribution, with only 6% saying they were not very or somewhat certain.

That percentage is greater than the numbers that reported that the sun was responsible. 10% reported that the phenomenon wasn't caused by human activity. 17% indicated that the United States was causing global warming, while 7% said Canada and 13% said China were causing global warming. Only 12% believed that global warming wasn't caused by human activity. My opponent's statement is scientifically baseless.

That percentage is greater than the numbers that reported that the sun was responsible. 10% reported that the phenomenon wasn't caused by human activity. 17% indicated that the United States was causing global warming, while 7% said Canada and 13% said China were causing global warming. Only 12% believed that global warming wasn't caused by human activity. I'll use a round two opening argument method in which

[3] "Within decades, a huge number of climate changes will occur. These changes will be observable with sufficient precision to feed climate models." [4] "The physical science baseline for climate impacts has been established." [5] "Scientists have little understanding of most of the processes of change in the climate system."

[7] The physical basis for the findings was accepted by the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences. 1. The language is off point and irrelevant. No one thinks a scientific consensus is wrong, yet many dismiss scientific consensus as being of no value. Why is this the case? Because scientific consensus should be sound on point as in the case of a belief in the existence of man-made climate change. So to fix this you need to start explaining this. Citing a study that we both know doesn't agree with us is obviously off point. 2. To say that its of "slim consensus" is nothing more than a spin. EVERY evidence that shows that man made climate change is real supports the statement that man made climate change is real. And this is because those positions take science seriously, unlike your opponent. I asked for rounds of texts on evidence for global warming (it said "global warming." no what happens if the earth heats up and that's 2 points, no matter what the reason.) So you fail round 1. The language is more appropriate and makes only minimal changes to the text. It is now in blue. The NRC report is the scientific consensus on the reality of man-made climate change.

The NRC Report does not prove that man-made climate change is real, even though it concludes otherwise. 2. The report on the reality of man-made climate change is the scientific consensus. If the report were rejected, the consensus would be void. [3] 3. The consensus cannot be true, because a scientific consensus does not exist on the reality of man-made climate change. The above evidence I provided proves the consensus does not exist. [4] 4. The consensus cannot be true because of a complete lack of understanding of the climate change by scientists in the scientific community. [6] 5. This evidence does not prove the existence of man-made climate change. It merely shows that climate models can be improved. The above evidence shows that a climate model cannot be used to prove the reality of man-made climate change. [5] 6. The conclusion is not reliable because the prevalence of human disease. It cannot be used to prove the reality of man-made climate change, because it is an observed event that doesn't need proving to be true. It is only an example of the reality of man-made climate change. [7] Pro's own sources prove that a climate model cannot prove

The consequences of not acting are too dire for there to be any other choice. The risks of taking such steps are vanishingly small given the threat posed. They are reputable people, scientists, including thousands of researchers doing and publishing the research who have spent years investigating this and warn us of the coming dangers if we do not deal with it now.

40	 The first most obvious mistake my opponent made in their argument was a cherry-picking fallacy. A cherry-picking fallacy is defined as "When only select evidence is presented in order to persuade the audience to accept a position, and evidence that would go against the position is withheld. The stronger the withheld evidence, the more fallacious the argument." [11] As you can see, my opponent, in round 2, only offered evidence which suggests anthropogenic climate change is real, and did not offer any evidence that suggests climate change is due to some other reason. A scientific consensus exists on the reality of anthropogenic climate change. -Stupidape This argument is fallacious because it doesn't take into account direct evidence, and only is about the opinions of climate scientists, who are not infallible. I already pointed this out in my main arguments, but that wasn't meant to be a direct response to my opponent, but a rebuttal on the general claim. In addition, there is room for doubt as long as there is not 100% of climate scientists who agree on this matter, which is not the case. "Man-made climate change has already claimed human lives and continues to do so..." -Stupidape This appears to be a Non Sequitur fallacy. This is "when the conclusion does not follow from the premises. In more informal reasoning, it can be when what is presented as evidence or reason is irrelevant or adds very little to support to the conclusion." [12] The amount of deaths happened from a heat wave in France. Sudden hot weather in one country doesn't prove that there is global climate change, let alone that it is anthropogenic. In addition, the heat-related deaths in the United States since 2000 has been going down[13], which is odd if supposedly there is significant amounts of warming. But yes, if you look at the graph provided by the EPA there, each of the three spikes in deaths, one in 2000, one soon after 2005, and one soon after 2010, are each going down over time. If you were to draw a straight line representing the average, it would also be going down. Sources: [11] https://www.logicallyfallacious.com... [12] https://www.logicallyfallacious.com... [13] https://www.epa.gov...
41	 If every warming-related death was from anthropogenic climate change, we could safely rule out every other potential reason. We would have proof of man-made climate change. However, with each death that happens from anything from rising pollution levels to rising disease and other causes that are out of our control, the claim made by us is even less accurate. For example, a common issue with heat-related deaths is heat illness, particularly during prolonged heat waves, like in Kansas. The common cause of heat illness is a lack of air conditioning. This can be explained by A) Many people can't afford or are allergic to air conditioning. B) Electricity doesn't reach all parts of Kansas or the temperature is too high to run electricity efficiently. C) The large majority of Kansas doesn't have air conditioning. We can also look at something that is happening today to better analyze this. The heat wave that happened in France in 2003 was caused by the same reason. The British Medical Journal reported that about 15,000-20,000 individuals died that year. However, was it man-made climate change that caused this or was it the fact that in 2003 France was in a drought and had little rain? [10] https://www.epa.gov...". Because of my opponent's second mistake, I could not properly specify my point about how rising temperatures will decrease the pollen count and thus aids in disease management. In this case, an increase of 1 degree C is a 15% reduction in pollen count[11] (1/7). The correct figure would be +9.43/-17.1% range. Pollen allergies are another health issue caused by rising temperatures, along with other conditions such as respiratory diseases. Using this sort of reasoning, you could look at carbon dioxide as a dangerous thing, because carbon dioxide affects crop production, water efficiency, and biodiversity, which affects humans. What this means is that a higher carbon dioxide can bring a more destructive set of mutations to the food chain, which in turn would increase the chances of illness. Because the environment is so interconnected, one alteration in the food chain would cause many other things to go wrong. There is a scientific consensus on this (as I showed in my main argument). According to a study by the American Public Health Association, heat-related deaths due to climate change are predicted to happen at a faster rate than predicted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Because global heat waves have increased in frequency and intensity, it has brought about many more heat-related deaths. A 2013 study found that the number of heat-related deaths between 1980 to 2005 was 21,500, which is only predicted to increase to 40,000 by 2080. However, the new study predicted that if we fail to reach a strong international consensus on climate change, the heat-related deaths of 2080 would be 75,000. Scientists would expect only 4,800 heat-related deaths to occur in a 20-year period if we acted immediately to control CO2 emissions[12]. For this reason, a 75,000 prediction can be explained as a worst-case scenario. At this point in the debate, I would like to clarify that I am only arguing for a connection between global warming and heat-related deaths and not an absolute claim that global warming is causing heat-related deaths. If this can be proven at a later point in the debate, I will concede. The global temperature is very, very, very far from any noticeable trend since ~1880. Serious scientists point this out. The reason why this is so, is the starting point is massively in the exceptional category. It is also known as the 'Pacific Decadal Oscillation', PDO. See here: https://wattsupwiththat.com/2015/04/08/how-to-make-it-appear-that-the-pacific-decadal-oscillation-pdo-is-not-an-oscillation/. Note well that this influences temperature, i.e. the fact is not controversial. There are many such factors which influence the temperature. Some significant ones are the ~60 year AC AO and the AMO, Solar system orbital forcing, solar induced geomagnetic field variations, and the ocean cycles. All of these have been shown to affect the global temperature, some of which the IPCC authors admitted to but others not. Note that in the physical sense, you can't have only one or two forcing which are important. You have to take them all into account. Note also that the claim that the solar system has no effect is preposterous. If one looks at the Lockwood-Frohlich combination of Satellite and Radio occultation evidence for the total solar irradiance, it shows clear cooling by ~0.073 Wm-2 per decade between 2004 and 2015 (see Figure 8). http://hockeyschtick.blogspot.com/2016/09/new-paper-solar-cycle-variability-contributes.html. The obvious conclusion is that cooling arises from the TSI dropping. On the other hand a link between TSI and global temperature occurs to be highly counterintuitive, since if it drops the Earth should be warmer due to reducing the outgoing radiation. In the physical sense the global climate system should be in exact or near equilibrium. The Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets would probably continue to melt into 2019. There would also be surface and atmosphere tropical warmth (humidity). There would be a much higher likelihood of catastroph
42	 What This Entire Paper Will Be About Is the Second Most Obvious Mistake My Opponent Made in Their Argument. This Mistake Is A Fallacy of Appeal to Popularity. This is when a speaker falsely claims something is true because most people believe it. So, my opponent's entire argument is an appeal to popularity fallacy. There are numerous other technical scientific reasons why this paper is true and the BCA is wrong. My opponent attempted to defend this appeal to popularity by saying how every year thousands of people die from heat waves in Europe, Japan and Australia. The problem with this is that every year tens of thousands of people die from heat waves in the U.S. every year, and from other heat related illnesses. We know Americans are more susceptible to heat illnesses than our European counterparts, so let's focus on why this is and why that is happening. The summer of 1936 saw a deadly heat wave in the United States. Outbreaks of heat strokes, heat exhaustion and respiratory difficulties plagued northern cities throughout the summer. Hundreds of people died in the middle of July. How could this have happened when we know of the heat hazards that face people now? The science has only advanced very recently. What changed between 1936 and now? As the chart above clearly illustrates there are far more deaths now than there were in the past. The possible reasons are: (1) Americans don't develop sweat glands until about 5 years old and the immature sweat gland doesn't dump as much heat as an adult gland. In addition, African American infants are at higher risk of death when exposed to heat. (2) Excessive sweating is seen in people with high levels of sympathetic nervous system activity, known as "Type A" personalities, while it is not evident in individuals with "Type B" personalities. (3) The heat wave that occurred in 1936 came on gradually, giving people plenty of time to prepare. The summer of 2012 came on much more quickly, and while air conditioning does help, it still has not become a widespread commodity. (4) Americans have moved towards a more sedentary lifestyle. (5) Between 1936 and now, 70% of water supplies in cities were moved from source to bottle, meaning when Americans get thirsty they must pay 50-100 times as much for water as they did in 1936. This will inevitably lead to poorer health. As a review of health problems that are aggravated by heat shows (un-sourced because I was too lazy to look up the stats on this, any health complications will be taken from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences): Sources: [11] "Appeal to Popularity". https://www.logicallyfallacious.com... [12] DeCoursey, John; Stines, Kevin (2004). "Sweating as a Regulation of Body Temperature". Human Physiology. MY POSITION NOW IS THAT: 1. Man-made Climate Change HAS ALREADY CLAIMED HUMAN LIVES 2. I'm not sure how many people have died or will die due to climate change. You could start by looking at how heat-related deaths in the United States have gone down since 2000, and then look into deaths elsewhere, and infer that man-made climate change has claimed a lot of lives [10] The World Health Organisation estimates that the warming and precipitation trends due to anthropogenic climate change of the past 30 years already claim over 150,000 lives annually. Many prevalent human diseases are linked to climate fluctuations, from cardiovascular mortality and respiratory illnesses due to heatwaves, to altered transmission of infectious diseases and malnutrition from crop failures....3. You could start by looking at studies by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences on health complications that are aggravated by heat. "Four such indicators that serve as a broad proxy for extreme heat stress were determined to be the excess mortality rate due to heat, excess mortality rate due to cold, the number of heat-related hospitalizations, and the number of heat-related records set on that day. Of these indicators, the heat-related mortality rate, and cold-related mortality rate accounted for the majority of the deaths caused by extreme heat events. Additionally, indicators of illness and discomfort, such as emergency department visits for heat-related illness, were also significant, accounting for 6% of the heat-related deaths. In contrast, the number of hospitalizations due to extreme cold events was an insignificant risk factor"[13] -YV.S 4. You could start by looking at the American Public Health Association's 2018 Position Statement on Climate Change and Health "In the United States, the economic impact of this [14] disease burden is devastating. For example, the estimated economic costs of the burden of climate-sensitive disease nationally range from $14-197 billion a year.

44	 Every expert in climate science agrees that man-made climate change is real. According to the world health organisation, climate change has killed over 150,000 people per year on average[11]. This amounts to about 500,000 deaths per year in the United States[12], in the past 10 years (1000 deaths multiplied by 10). According to the CDC, 828 children die of heat-related deaths in the U.S. each year[13]. Of these children, only 147 deaths were due to the 2003 heat wave[14]. The spikes in U.S. heat-related deaths are due to climate change[15]. Human activity has caused our climate to change, and is clearly correlated with the deaths of Americans every year. This also proves that global warming is real and has severe consequences, both now and in the future. In fact, the 120 deadliest days of the summer have warmed at a rate of about 2.31 degrees Fahrenheit[16]. The continued warming of our planet is unprecedented, and the only thing that could possibly cause this is human activity. [11] The evidence of the number of deaths are not far from what the UN predicted, which is over 100,000 deaths per year for the developing world[17]. I found a gov website that shows when, in years, people died from heat waves, and it was in 2000, 2005, and 2010[18]. In addition, the graphs provide by the US DHHS have the deaths go up and down in accordance with the graph provided by the EPA for the US. However, in 2000, the heat wave wasn't a spike, it was just a normal heat wave, which was the 3rd worst heat wave since 1930[19]. If you examine the website [20], you'll find that the spikes in deaths in 2003 and 2006 were due to the same mechanism. There was a heat wave and when it was over, the deaths went down. 2005 was a little more difficult to correlate, because it was a fairly moderate heat wave[21]. However, if you look at what is on the graph provided by the US DHHS, you'll find that the deaths also spike in 2005[22]. In 2010, it was not a spike[23]. The temperature stays relatively the same for almost the entire year[24], but about 6 months later you see another spike, which coincides with another spike in deaths[25]. The deaths during the years 2010 and 2011 were due to the prolonged winter of 2009-2010[26]. These prolonged months in 2009 and 2010 led to a significantly colder than normal winter, and in turn a colder than normal January. A colder than normal January leads to a longer and less severe heat wave. We can see from the charts that people die of heat-related deaths in the summer. However, according to the EPA, heat-related deaths (which are from heat waves, not necessarily hot summer months) from 2000-2015 is going down[27]. If you look at each of the spikes in heat-related deaths, all three were going down by the time the heat wave occurred. In addition, with each successive heat wave that occurred, the heat-related deaths were going down. The problem with assuming that this proves anthropogenic climate change, is that it doesn't fit into the scientific consensus, which also all agree that climate change is man-made[28]. There is also the possibility that the heat-related deaths could be correlated to the large decline in poverty over the last 10 years[29]. Other sources [12] http://www.ndih.org...

53	 The climate is changing. The local weather may change but the global climate stays basically the same. The oceans are rising and this has been happening for millions of years. The IPCC is a legitimate organization that has largely disproved critics in the scientific community. You can't and shouldn't trust anyone who disagrees with the science. I propose that the climate change community is pushing a giant agenda that is very interesting and should be supported, considering how much fraud and corruption has occurred from the other side of the argument. The skeptics are simply a faction of people who are trying to keep us in the dark ages. This is not only wrong but dangerous too. One does not need to support every scientific theory to be skeptical and reasonable at the same time. Humans aren't even responsible for 1% of the Earth's emissions. There is no proof or consensus that humans are causing the climate to change. CO2 has almost reached it's saturation point at 80ppm and 570ppm is the maximum sustainable level. The science is settled even though the local weather is always going to fluctuate and climates always change. Proponents of fake news claim there is no proof and consensus when there is actually a lot of the former and 97% of scientists on record. All the real proof and evidence exists.

54	 The climate is not changing. This is an old ruse. Various times in history, in different parts of the world, the local weather has changed. Today, much of the world is in the midst of a long-term cooling trend and ice is again building up in the Arctic ocean. The land mass that is Antarctica, even though off the map, has also been cooling for a long time. This is often, but not always, called Global Warming. This cooling does not mean it is not warming somewhere else on the globe. It just means that the colder weather more than offsets the warmer weather. On this planet, there is a naturally occurring cycle that is comprised of time intervals of hot and cold weather, and this cycle repeats itself. Scientists often play up this cycle and make it seem like its causing climate change. It is not caused by the weather or climate, but the atmosphere, which depends on how close or far away from the Sun the Earth is. Sometimes scientists make it sound like scientists at NASA have found evidence that the planet is actually tilting off-axis causing a change in the atmosphere. This way of thinking is just plain stupid, if not dangerous. The climate is not changing. The weather is. I propose that climate change is a fraud and that the people who support it are all frauds and charlatans. The Earth is cooling off. The oceans are not rising either. The IPCC is a communist organization that has communist agendas. The science of climate change is suspect at best. You can't and shouldn't trust anyone or anyone who tells you that the climate is changing.
55	 Greetings and welcome to the debate. In this round, I will present my key reasons for believing that climate change is indeed real, And not a hoax, As certain political leaders have said. I will start with the official definition of climate change. Climate change, Which is distinct from weather, Is said to be global or regional changes in climate patterns, In particular changes apparent from the mid to late 20th century onwards, And attributed largely to the increased levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide produced by the use of fossil fuels. I will next discuss how COS22;, Is a potent greenhouse gas, And I will discuss how rising levels of COS22; lead to warming. This essay will contain three parts. Firstly, I will define and describe how a market-based cap and trade scheme works. Secondly, I will analyze how emissions can be reduced through a trading scheme. Finally, I will discuss and contrast the benefits and drawbacks of a cap and trade system. We can start with definition of a cap and trade system. The cap and trade is a market-based policy, Which is an open market system where CO2 emission allowances are determined through a periodically increasing tax on emission and is traded. First, The cap would be considered the minimum amount of emissions allowed by the policy maker. Then the trading would be the shifting of CO2 emission by the policy maker to different industries to combat a carbon deficit. In other words, The cap and trade system is a policy where emission allowances are auctioned or sold for a given amount. Moreover, Companies pay for the COS 22; they emitted rather than the COS 22; per ton of pollution they release. In this situation the cap becomes the maximum amount that the company could be emitting, And the government act as a steward of a market where efficiency could be gained by the emission markets. The government would control emission allocation in a cap and trade policy so that emission amount can be reduced or increased until a cap is achieved. Once a cap is placed, Then the companies would face either a cost and financing of the technology. A cost, Which means that the COS 22; that they were generating would be at a cost as the COS 22; emission. This price of COS 22; is ultimately based on the local emission market price. Secondly, My second argument is how a cap and trade system may lower emissions? As climate change is considered the result of greenhouse gases, A cap and trade scheme would allow producers to pay for their COS 22;, Rather than add more pollution. Basically, this scheme will raise the cost of the cheaper industrial fuels that emit greenhouse gases. For instance, Oil and natural gas that are heat sources would be costlier to use since they emit most of their carbon dioxide during combustion. Furthermore, A cap and trade system would allow polluters to trade emissions, And this would create a strong incentive for industries to create cleaner and more efficient ways to create their goods. For instance, If a company is having difficulty meeting their emission goals, Then they could buy offsets from another facility with emission reduction projects. After that, This company could then sell or trade any excess COS 22; that they are not required by the cap to have. In other words, Companies would have
56	 Greetings and welcome to the debate. In this round, I will present my key reasons for believing that climate change is indeed real and not a hoax, As certain political leaders have said. But first, We must define climate change. The official definition of climate change is: a change in global or regional climate patterns, In particular, A change apparent from the mid to late 20th century onwards and attributed largely to the increased levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide produced by the use of fossil fuels. My first reason is that we have seen a huge increase in COS22; levels in the atmosphere, And this can be correlated with human industrial activity. In fact, Atmospheric COS22; levels are directly proportionate to human industrial activity. And increasing COS22; levels lead to a predictable rise in temperature. You may say that climates change anyway, And COS22; levels will fluctuate naturally, But it is no coincidence that it starts changing rapidly the moment humans figure out how to mine coal and burn fossil fuels. My second reason is that the Earth's temperature has risen by approximately 1"C since 1969. This might not seem like much, But in comparison to previous climate changes, It is vastly significant. Ocean temperatures have also risen by 0. 7"F, Killing a statistically significant proportion of the Great Barrier Reef. My final reason is that Arctic sea ice is shrinking, And polar bears may see the first iceless summer by 2050. We can conclude that climate change is indeed real and not a hoax. I await my opponent's argument!

60	 I propose that climate change is a fraud and that the people who support it are all frauds and charlatans. The science of human-caused climate change is faulty and full of misconceptions and bad science. There is proof that climate change is all fake news started by Obama & crew. The policies that people promote to remedy the non-issue of human-caused climate change are ineffective and damaging. Those people who rely on ineffective and damaging policies are not acting to benefit themselves or society, but instead for the sake of virtue signaling. Those people who believe that policies to mitigate human-caused climate change are necessary are also virtue signaling. I don't support that belief. I only support personal liberty over government control. We should all be allowed to do whatever we like. People can do what they like for themselves without having to concern themselves with whether it is good or bad for the greater good or the environment. Everyone should get what they want because that's fair. Everyone should be allowed to pollute without restriction. Pollution is really good for the world. It's good for the environment. Everyone should have the right to burn oil and gas and have the right to dump their waste into the ocean. Everyone should be allowed to drive a Tesla and to fly in an airplane. We should have no air pollution laws or fuel efficiency standards. Pollution should not be regulated because all pollution is good. Everyone should be allowed to drive a huge Ford pickup truck. Everyone should be allowed to throw trash and whatever they like into the ocean. Everyone should be allowed to have as many children as they like. You can call me a fascist. The government should be the deciding factor of how society should be. We are all equal. I oppose inequality. These are opinions that everyone should have the freedom to have. Keep spreading the good word.

65	 According to The Center For Biological Diversity, the world’s climate is changing as a result of the burning of fossil fuels. The burning of fossil fuels creates carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide traps heat in the atmosphere, and this causes the world’s temperature to rise. This is likely to reduce the amount of arable land on Earth, and it will cause food prices to increase. Furthermore, climate change is likely to result in rising sea levels. There even are major cities that could be flooded. As the population increases, the production of fossil fuels will increase. This is likely to result in climate change occurring at an increasingly rapid pace. Because of this, it is crucial that we take steps to prevent increasing the production of fossil fuels
66	 Climate change occurs because of the burning of fossil fuels, which in turn creates carbon dioxide. This CO2 traps heat in the atmosphere, thus causing the global climate to warm up. Major cities and arable land will be flooded, and food prices will increase as a result.

In addition, population growth is expected to cause increased production of fossil fuels. This in turn will accelerate climate change.
70	 The task at hand is to determine whether anthropogenic climate change is non-existent. From a common definition the debate is about the harmful rise of global temperature. The debate is not about the definition of "climate change" which seems to be harmful to some people, but that definition is not relevant. I will use the commonly accepted definition "a harmful rise in global temperature." The simplest solution to the debate is to ignore the term "anthropogenic" (as if man is somehow significant) and just use the terms "natural" and "man-made." 800 gigatons of CO2 are emitted into the atmosphere both annually from nature and by humans. Manmade CO2 (from burning fossil fuels) is 3.62% of the emissions. This 3.62% can not be the cause of global warming. The alarmists side has no empirical evidence that 3.62% of annual CO2 emissions can cause global warming. If we replaced the part of the debate about man-made global warming with the statement "banning people from breathing will not solve the problem" then that would sound pretty ridiculous. Even grant money to research the problem would be funny when limited to the 3.62% of CO2 emissions that humans can actually change. Politically, man-made global warming is a great scapegoat for environmental issues like "global warming" or "climate change." The money trails point to scientists that are biased by grant money and industry control over who gets funded and who does not. This debate is about causes not effects, thus the possible positive and negative impacts will not be addressed. Here are some of the technical comments about this brief essay (not including some of the punctuation issues): 1. The distinction between actual and political is important. Anthropogenic is basically meaning man-made or generated by humans and only in regard to global warming (the topic at hand) means 3.62% man-made emissions. The common assumption is that that 3.62% is a significant portion, but that is only an assumption. 2. As stated, scientific research and academic credentials are not necessary to dismiss the very weak arguments. This is why logical arguments, not the authority of a few will be argued here. 3. The assumption that the discussion of attribution of the warming period between 1910 and 1940 because of the development of nuclear weapons in WWII was not included. 4. 400 PPM is a poor measure of how significant CO2 is in the atmosphere. To give some perspective PPM is ten times higher than that at the peak of snow plowing seasons at my house. 5. Making comparisons about the amount of CO2 released by animals is an absurd exaggeration. 6. The reference for the assertion about greenhouse gases in early Earth was rejected as a link that would not open. The initial sentence should have read "The atmosphere has been composed of 21% oxygen, 78% nitrogen, 0.9% argon, and trace gases including CO2 for billions of years." 7. The entire 3.62% man-made emissions statement is questionable and could use a source. 8. The discussion of politics is irrelevant to the topic. 9. More words were needed to add to develop this point: Yes, the governments to some degree need to act, but acting from fear and blindly is not the answer. That is where realistic and informed thinking people need to step in. 10. The source for the statement that the greenhouse gases have increased by 40% was rejected. The following link is the source, but it is rejected as there is no mention of a start date: http://www.livescience.com... 11. Although those who will be involved in this debate are at least somewhat intelligent, doctors give you something for that [from a more serious argument]: According to a recent report by the World Health Organization and the Center for Disease Control, up to 80% of people will consume over the counter sleep remedies at least once in their lifetimes. Many of these drugs include the use of antihistamines which have little to no effect on insomnia, and are in fact known to cause drowsiness the following day.[4] Another well known drug with a similar side effect is codeine, a widely used muscle relaxant and pain reliever. Most often coupled with aspirin, this combination puts the consumer at risk of addiction.[5] Other dangerous narcotics, often used for anesthesia, are especially significant because they "put a block in the reaction where the perception of pain should have been." [6] Furthermore, nearly a third of the population is prescribed medication for sleeping, asthma, attention deficit, anxiety and other mental disorders every year.[7] "Many of these drugs create a double whammy, combining depressants with stimulants, much like caffeine." [8] Once used daily, a person's physical and mental ability to live productively is challenged.[9] It is not healthy to consume any of these drugs that are available without a prescription; they have their place in emergency situations, but should not be used repeatedly without consulting a physician, who could potentially have access to prescription medicine to treat any underlying problems. Here is another rewrite of the original in a more logical format: {The task at hand is to determine whether anthropogenic global warming is possible or if a harmful rise of global temperature is. The topic at hand is anthropogenic global warming, and it will refer to global warming as it relates to human activities. The argument will only focus on those influences that humans have direct control over. From a common
71	 The task at hand is to "...contend that anthropogenic climate change is non-existent." From a common definition anthropogenic means relating to, or resulting from the influence of human beings on nature. Then, from common usage "climate change" means a harmful rise in global temperature. This could be a difficult task. The earth's atmosphere is 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, 0.9% argon, and 0.1% trace gases including CO2.[1] Assumption (for this paragraph only) that the small trace gas of CO2 (.04%) is the cause of global warming. The focus here will be upon sources of CO2 emissions both natural and manmade. The source emissions of CO2 would by a most rational people would be the cause of global warming. According to the IPCC 800 gigatons of CO2 is emitted into the atmosphere from nature and man, annually.[2] Most rational people would consider a source that is more than 51% to be the cause of a problem. Some irrational people might try to argue that 33% would be a threshold for cause. Only, crazy people would state that something that is less than 5% could be consider the cause. That brings us to the percent of total CO2 emissions from mankind. That percent of CO2 emissions is 3.62% (29 from man of 800 total gigatons)! [2] This 3.62% can not be the cause of global warming. Now, questioning if CO2 is the cause of global warming. The alarmist side uses thresholds in parts per million (PPM). 400 PPM sounds scary and 0.04% is at an insanely small amount, both numbers are the same. Imagine, how quick the alarmists arguments would be dismissed if they said that 0.04% of atmospheric gases drove global climate. Then, if combined with only 3.6% of annual CO2 emissions is from man, this is an incredibly small number that man is responsible for. Using just common sense methods, it becomes very hard to believe claims made by alarmists. Anyone attempting to say 3.6% is the cause of a problem would be laughed at. Especially, when the gas in question is exhaled by each one of us. The real reasons for climate change to be anthropogenic is political and financial. Just federal grants for climate change related projects is greater than $10 billion.[3] Scientists are just as financially motivated as anyone else. A climate scientist that is outside of the mainstream will not be funded. This creates incentives to stay in agreement with those in political power. Anthropogenic climate change as a political is perfect for oppressive progressive politicians. The solutions to this false issue are more governmental control over the daily lives of harmless people. The politicians have scientist by the purse strings, this ensures compliance. This debate is about causes not effects, thus positive and negative impacts will not be addressed.

The focus here will be upon sources of CO2 emissions both natural and manmade. The source emissions of CO2 would by a rational people be the cause of global warming. If the total emissions of CO2 from the atmosphere were 800 gigatons, as it is in the most rational view, 800 gigatons is almost 50 times the amount of CO2 produced by man. It is reasonable to believe that nature is the major contributor to CO2 emissions and that CO2 emissions from man is only responsible for 3.6% (of 800 gigatons, or 29 gigatons), insignificant amount. Some irrational people might try to argue that 33% would be a threshold for cause. This insignificant amount also demonstrates that it is not possible for CO2 to be the cause. There is no sane person on the planet that would believe that the 3.6% of global annual CO2 emissions that is from man could be the cause of climate change or global warming. The alarmist side uses thresholds in parts per million (PPM). 400 PPM sounds scary, yet the actual amount of CO2 in the atmosphere is less than 400 PPM. The PPM represents the amount of CO2 from the atmosphere in a specific volume. 0.04% of atmospheric gases is at an insanely small amount, both numbers are the same. Consider, what happens if CO2 is exhaled by each one of us. Imagine the air passing out of our lungs. If the alarmists compared the 3.6% of the annual total CO2 emissions from man, to the 3.6% of the exhaled CO2 this is ridiculous. The alarmists use percentages in scary numbers because it is difficult to deal with the reality. Who wants to hear that only 0.04% of a 78% nitrogen/21% oxygen/0.9% argon/0.1% CO2 atmospheric composition would be in any way be a contributing factor to global warming. These issues, however, being political, are prefect for oppressive progressive politicians. The solutions to this false issue are more governmental control over the daily lives of harmless people. The politicians have scientist by the purse strings, and it ensure compliance. This debate is about causes not effects, thus positive and negative impacts will not be addressed. 1. http://climate.ncsu.edu... 2. http://www.climatechange2013.org... 3. http://www.gao.gov...
73	 The argument claims "The task at hand is to... contest that man-made climate change is a non-existent thing. From a common definition "climate change" means a harmful rise in global temperature. This could be a difficult task because at a number of places (and largely in the pages of 'Nature' magazine) an argument has been advanced that "climate change" refers to natural climate change, even though it means exactly the same thing. A science-as-narrative argument has been advanced that non-human-caused climate change can continue forever, and only human activity creates climate change, which is relatively-recent and rapidly speeding up. While this scientific definition of climate change and "rising global temperature" are the exact same thing in meaning, it's become a de-facto gotcha trick to exploit that very many people may have the colloquial idea of "climate change" as just "weather", and that has made the term "climate change" a tipping point that suddenly turns every discussion into another "climate science" battle between alarmists and deniers. Those who are familiar with the term climate change usually have it in mind that it is a natural thing, and those who mention it almost always are doing so only as a reference to human activity, and when the issue really heats up it's almost always a case of activist vs activist (i.e. deniers vs alarmists) debate about the notion that whatever is happening now is happening because we've been irresponsible with our carbon emissions and need to "fix it" so it doesn't become a problem. This debate is about causes not effects, thus positive and negative impacts will not be addressed.
74	 Anthropogenic climate change, as a theory, is an intellectual sleight-of-hand trick for political control. The true reason being it is a financial opportunity of oppressive progressives. The discussion of man-made climate change assumes the cause is human activity. The alarmist climate change science is in fact political in nature. This is why the debate is known as man-made climate change. The very name is about causes and not effects. For a concept to be considered man-made the cause has to be only human activity. All natural occurrences would be included in the definition of anthropogenic climate change. The focus here is only on one component of the argument, 1% of total CO2 emissions from man. This is 29 gigatons out of 800 that are emitted into the atmosphere each year from nature and mankind. [1] This 1% can not be the cause of a global problem. This 1% is a small number that could not possibly cause all the problems associated with anthropogenic climate change. The alarmist side also uses thresholds. 400 parts per million (PPM) sounds scary and 0.04% is at an insanely small amount, both numbers are the same. Imagine, how quick the alarmists argument would be dismissed if they said that 0.04% of atmospheric gases drove global climate. Then if combined with only 3.6% of annual CO2 emissions is from mankind, this is an incredibly small number that mankind is responsible for. Using just common sense methods, it becomes very hard to believe claims made by alarmists. Anyone attempting to say 3.6% is the cause of a problem would be laughed at. Especially, when the gas in question is exhaled by each one of us. The real reasons for climate change to be anthropogenic is political and financial. Federal grants for climate change related projects is greater than $10 billion.[3] Scientists are just as financially motivated as anyone else. The only way to stay funded is to remain in line with those in political power. A climate scientist that is outside of the mainstream will not be funded. This creates incentives to stay in agreement with those in political power. We can cure ourselves of this disease, by ignoring the false claims of alarmists. Money will never be withheld, on one, the integrity of the government, and two, the skepticism of citizens of those who wish to rule us.

I'm running out of characters, I'll have to post the second round on a different message, if Pro wants to negate them, I'll post it with my final round. Last round/Round 3. My opponent has presented no positive evidence of his own, and instead puts forth the claim that a very small amount of CO2 emissions cause climate change. He also makes the assertion that 1% of CO2 could not possibly cause the "entirety" of a "global problem". However, in doing so he is not just denying that the "global problem" exists, he is also calling into doubt the effect of all CO2 emissions. If a 1% reduction in CO2 can not possibly cause any problems, then why even bother attempting to reduce emissions by the proposed 80%? The real reason that any of us gives a **** about climate change at all is because our own economic welfare is threatened by the harshest effects. Of course it is not all reduced to an "inconvenience" as he would assert, if it were so unimportant it would never have made the news headlines at all. If we are to return to the stone ages we should at least wait until there are enough people that voted in congress that it won't matter if we have no ability to grow our own crops, havent used a truck for transport in over a decade and don't have enough fossil fuel to run a car for a month. Until then I will enjoy life as it is, including several a/c units, a car and a house in the suburbs. That is, as long as I can afford them and they are still legal. I suggest that we require a science meeting. However, that is not practical, so I will just make two points. First, the economic value weighing in favor of increasing CO2 by burning fossil fuels is considerable and it is an insurmountable obstacle to argue against the economic development based on burning fossil fuels. Second, the science is that CO2 has been proven to have a significant greenhouse effect. I suggest that any balanced debate would allow for those who argue the other point of view to discuss the evidence in good faith and come to a conclusion that allows the informed intelligent voter to cast his vote. The current political
75	 This is as close as the opponent comes to making an argument about cause: "A scientific consensus exists on the reality of anthropogenic climate change. Climate scientists have repeatedly tried to make this clear. It is time for the rest of us to listen.'[0]" Then the source basically states, science does not know, but what if. Then appeals to emotion by asking people to think about their grandchildren, thus action to reduce CO2 must be taken, you know just in case. The question could also be asked, what if the consensus is wrong? The alarmists are advocating for billions of people to reduce their living standards to keep the planet from maybe warming a few degrees. Looking at the analogy mostly used to explain green house effect, which is a green house. A few years ago I was in an empty plastic sheet green house on a sunny but very cold day. The very thin sheet of clear plastic raised the inside temperature significantly, but the owner was planning on disassembling within a few days. My question to the owner was "would a second sheet of plastic make the green house warmer for longer?" The owner looked at me and said "it does not work that way". There would be an insulation effect if there is a gap between the two sheets of plastic. Yet, this false consensus is asking us to believe that more CO2 equals higher global temperatures. From an idea that more plastic does not make a green house warmer to a question would more CO2 make the Earth warmer. There is research that suggests once there is enough CO2 to have a green house effect more will not cause higher temperatures[1]. This is outside the narrative and must be stopped. Government's need a reason for people to be scared so that controls can be forced on everyone. In summary, consensus is not science! Climate change has become like a religion for those that believe. Western civilization learned centuries ago that state and religion is best separated. Thus, policy changes based on climate change consensus should not be enacted by governments. 1. http://hockeyschtick.blogspot.com...
76	 While the idea of climate change and how much of our environmental impact humans actually have on climate is not clearly understood; scientific consensus still has a good hold on many American and Westerners. When it comes to climate change the United States is in a unique position that most nations in the world find themselves. We import over 40% of our oil supplies.[2] From where we need to go; a green clean energy future is not clear. The catch 22 that we have in America is we need to use fossil fuel, but there is little consensus in American politics about solutions to this problem. This means we must make drastic changes in our lifestyle. In the years to come we will no longer use fossil fuels and rely on more renewable energy sources as a nation. What that actually looks like is clear, but how to get there is not so clear. We need to make changes today, and some are more drastic than others. One would think that to make sure the largest impact is made the government should enact the largest changes possible. That is what many in America are seeing with a Republican controlling the presidency. Cutting regulations and eliminating stifling regulation on businesses should be enough said. The power to implement this type of fundamental change and through and influence certain technologies. For an example how the UN has been able to impact the way countries think and think about themselves in this field.[3] Or The Netherlands is going backwards in solving its renewable energy problems.[4] In 2010 The Netherlands was on pace to close all its old coal power plants, but turned to construction of new coal power stations.[5]. So What do the United States propose to do, what are the solutions? As pointed out previously; it isn't clear. Especially in the most significant change proposed by the Trump Administration; which is to build pipelines and export oil. This plays into the hands of the opponent's rebuttal about only having to use 1/20th of Oil. Since there is a lack of infrastructure, why allow new pipelines? The simple answer is we need the oil. Let us give the advocate what they want and concede to building the pipelines. Because we will need them to protect our environment. If this were true; why the National Park Service. And be allowed to so drastically change the American landscape by allowing Fracking in the state of Texas, to the dismay of the local community. Or Why We must bail out Solyndra and other green energy investments? The are obvious repercussions to using fracking in Texas, as well as building pipelines that will change the look of the American landscape. The repercussions to doing either of these things is very clear to me, more CO2 in our air, pollution and soot on America's land and a portion of the American population has not made it clear how concerned they are with the environmental impact on land. We need pipelines and exports. We need to give Green energy companies the time and support to make better technology and better money[6]. The extraction of oil from fracking land Texas has many implications.[7] Unlike pipelines and extraction which are not a current occurrence being discussed in America. That is why; it is necessary to focus on a topic that has implications on everyday life that are happening now. Implications that will be with us for many years to come. Getting back to the text, what can the opponent say about cause? Right now the opponent has nothing because the opponent is making a claim, in the form of a premise, about consensus. It is completely lacking in empirical support and must be stated as opinion. Therefore, the opponent can only say, "Although there is not direct empirical support that consensus in that scientific papers related to climate change have found a greater frequency in consensus. But they haven't found a less frequency of a consensus, which is also true. In this sense it must be stated that consensus, much like opinions, are relative. Depending on the topic or state we are in depends on what is said in an academic journal. The question though becomes why is the rest of the world based in this consensus then? The answers are; a potential world wide legal and regulation problem, and the potential for a worldwide economic crash. Lets start off with the latter, because this is in control of the government. When the Roman Empire was making a transition from Imperial Rome to the Roman Empire the Roman elite were desperately trying to change the way people thought about themselves and the world around them. They wanted more
77	 First, let us be clear that the alarmist proponents are reluctant to address arguments that challenge their theory. Instead, they label any deviation from their theory “denial.” In the campaign to discredit critics, they often resort to name calling, accusing skeptics of lying about their credentials or using “junk science” to bolster their arguments. Scientists and authors such as Anthony Watts and John Christy have provided piles of data and documentation refuting the theory that human activity contributes to dangerous climate change[0]. Even then, these studies are rejected by climate change theorists. Further, the uncertainty over the extent and type of climate change remains significant, which is the real purpose of the strategy by the scientific community to develop new standards of “consensus.” As Professor Richard Lindzen of MIT points out: “Probably over 90% of scientists…subscribe to the view that climate is changing and…most of that is the result of mankind’s activities. There is, however, the crucial point that there is no agreement about the extent of any warming, the rate of warming, the consequences, or the remedies….The issue therefore becomes: What is the form of the uncertainties?….and that form determines the extent to which warming is desirable, the extent to which warming is dangerous, the extent to which warming can be controlled and the extent to which it makes sense to adopt expensive and inconvenient remedies [when the warming] is small and harmless….[1] Yet, the political/scientific consensus is that more CO2 in the atmosphere = higher global temperatures! Yet, the evidence that this is the case is extremely weak. Although many forms of “evidence” are used to support climate change as a real phenomenon, none of the evidence actually proves the theory is true. Here are some examples: (1) 97% of scientists agree the world is warming[0]. The question at the heart of the 97% myth is whether scientists agree that humans are the primary cause of climate change. Even before the debate over climate change began, the issue at hand was to prove that humans caused the warming. Since it had already been proved that human activity results in atmospheric increases in certain greenhouse gases, scientists were questioned to determine whether or not the majority believed humans caused the warming. And they did. The only problem: It is a meaningless result. In the beginning, scientists were interested in proving humans were involved. But once the scientific community concluded that humans are involved in climate change (through the emission of carbon dioxide and other gases), they set out to determine the extent of those changes. Had the question been, “Do humans cause changes in climate,” the answer would be no. The Earth would not be in its current state of being had humans never evolved. Obviously, humans affect the environment, both directly and indirectly. Humans alter the Earth’s climate as they do any other environment. They deforest the land, install homes, buildings, and pave cities. Humans influence climate by releasing greenhouse gases (like carbon dioxide) into the atmosphere, thereby altering the global climate. But to answer the question whether or not humans are involved in global warming, we only need to question whether or not humans have a net positive or negative effect on the environment. Other animals have various levels of effects as well. So does industry, agriculture, and Mother Nature herself. Cooling of the Earth will cause the death of large numbers of humans, plants, animals, and other living species. Warmer temperatures will increase agriculture and expand inhabitable zones, resulting in increases in plant and animal life. Carbon dioxide is only one of many contributing factors that can alter the climate. Evidence of a correlation between temperature and carbon dioxide does not explain causation. Yet, the 97% results are continually used as evidence to support the idea that humans are the primary cause of climate change. 2) The Hockey Stick – A Survey of Scientists’ Opinions on Global Warming When presenting global warming theory, it is more effective to use temperature graphs than a chronological explanation of the past two hundred years. The graphics invoke images of medieval times and the American Civil War and are all the easier to explain. The goal is to represent the last hundred years as anomalous. Much of the idea behind global warming theory is that the data of the past two hundred years is not a representative sample of what the Earth has experienced over time. Researchers use tree
78	 Here is some text: {There is a scientific consensus that anthropogenic climate change is a theory with some supporting evidence, but there is no definitive proof. In fact, there is an alternative theory of why and how CO2 affects global temperature. There is a stunning lack of compelling supporting evidence for this consensus. Furthermore, the level of consensus is irrelevant. It is like having 80% of people believe the world is flat. People make decisions every day that cause catastrophes, which at the time they occur are based on consensus but in hindsight turn out to be the exact opposite of what turned out to be correct. There is a scientific consensus that the moon is round and close to the earth. Over 400 years ago this was unproven, but there were people who continued to believe that it is round and close to the earth even when the contrary was common-accepted wisdom.

90	 I propose that climate change is a fraud and that the people who support it are all frauds and charlatans. The science of human-caused climate change is faulty and full of misconceptions and bad science. 1. Video evidence - The In-depth Story Behind A Climate Fraud. The 97% consensus fraud. 2. It's mathematically impossible and against the laws of physics that a tiny human mass verses huge Earth mass, That the former can effect the latter. 3. The properties of CO2 are such that it can't create global warming on the scale indicated by scientists. This is because CO2 reaches it's saturation point at 80 parts / million and doesn't reflect any significant amount of heat after this point is reached. 4. Maurice Strong is the main person that started this whole climate frenzy movement and was found to be corrupt and fled to China to hide from the global police. 5. Climate data fraud. Tree rings used as evidence when it is known that tree ring growth is not an accurate measurement of temperature. "Hide the decline" email by Phil Jones. Mike's trick. Hockey stick nonsense. Inverted graphs. Etc. 6. Climate Change is the biggest hoax and sham made by Obama and his crew of liberal loving communist democrats. If you allow them to take money from our paychecks into a plan that doesn't a solution because the problem does not exist because climate change doesn't exist because climate change is natural cycles in nature and nothing to do with Obama or human caused catastrophic global warming, You are giving the democrats power to the Chinese for a global communist take over. To submit to the new world order. Stand your ground. Refute all these points. Good luck

While most scientists don’t agree with the IPCC report the ones that do are corrupt and have a financial motivation or a political agenda that is tied in with green parties. The science of human-caused climate change is not correct. The whole report is based on the flawed assumption of CO2 emission as a cause of climate change. The properties of CO2 are such that it can’t create global warming on the scale indicated by scientists. 1. The vast bulk of climate change is caused by the sun. It is clear the modern warming is over, why is this not clear to deniers? 2. IPCC Climate Change Reports are primarily written by climatologists, not by the lead author (Al Gore for two reports), thus the reports should be read with skepticism as they might also reflect the opinion and financial motivation of the author. 3. The IPCC has a political agenda to support with financial incentive. 4. The IPCC is a driving force behind the government's cap and trade policy. It makes billions off these trading schemes, many more billions in carbon taxes and emission taxes and sales of emission permits, and all this all off deception, lies, and misinformation to fraudulently support un-scientific political solutions to fake problems. Al Gore makes billions off it, too. 5. The IPCC shouldn't be in control of research as it is corrupted by having had the economic, financial, and political bias from the very start of the climate-change movement. 6. Al Gore and others created this climate crisis as it was seen as an opportunity to get rich off a crisis, to "save the planet" for the usual liberal reasons (stop the automobile industry and taxes). If we reduced CO2 output into the atmosphere by 50% would it make any discernible change in the climate? It won't and there would be financial loss as we would be hit with electricity costs to a lesser degree and cause job losses. 7. Most scientists that support the IPCC report have a financial interest in it. 8. The UN (UNFCCC) has a global-warming agenda to push but lacks sufficient scientific credentials to be taken seriously. 9. When scientists predict there's a 2/3 chance of rain, it doesn't always rain. It also doesn't always stop raining. (This deals with the scientists.) 10. There will be no global warming for 20-25 years. Satellite data and measurements do not match climate model predictions. 11. The Average temperature around the globe has stopped increasing and may even start to decrease for the next 20-25 years. 12. Even if you save energy, it doesn't mean you are lowering CO2 output or saving the planet. What you are doing is stopping your technology usage so your life is grimmer and quality of life is less. 13. The science of human-caused climate change is faulty and full of misconceptions and bad science. 1. Most scientists don't support the IPCC report; they understand that the effects of the sun on climate predominates over CO2. 2. IPCC makes money from the climate-change scam, keeps having to push scientifically debunked nonsense to keep it alive. 3. Carbon footprint alarmism allows a righteous political agenda to push for regulations, taxation, and cap and trade schemes to fatten government coffers, environment-related industry firms, and left-wing foundations (
92	 I propose that climate change is a fraud and that the people who support it are all frauds and charlatans. The science of human-caused climate change is faulty and full of misconceptions and bad science. 1. Video evidence - The In-depth Story Behind A Climate Fraud. The 97% consensus fraud. 2. It's mathematically impossible and against the laws of physics that a tiny human mass verses huge Earth mass, That the former can effect the latter. 3. The properties of CO2 are such that it can't create global warming on the scale indicated by scientists. This is because CO2 reaches it's saturation point at 80 parts / million and doesn't reflect any significant amount of heat after this point is reached. 4.

94	 Most scientific organizations, including the National Academy of Sciences, the American Meteorological Society, the American Geophysical Union, and the American Chemical Society, have issued declarations[1][2][3][4][5] stating that there is an overwhelming consensus among scientists that climate change is occurring and that it is induced by human activity. While climate change skeptics have long argued that scientists were divided on the issue, even President Bush in 2006 admitted that “the debate is over” when it comes to anthropogenic climate change, due to the concurrence of multiple scientific bodies and the lack of any other serious and credible scientific evidence that would contradict the concurrence. As a result, scientific organizations representing 1.5 million scientists have said, “[n]o convincing alternative explanations or alternative scientific theories have emerged to explain the modern observed climate change” and that “it is imperative that policymakers base their decisions concerning this matter on sound science, and this opinion provides a useful resource for policymakers.”. There is also scientific consensus regarding the effects of climate change in areas such as increased occurrence of heat waves, frequency and intensity of severe storms, sea level rise, effects on food production, effects on freshwater resources, and increases in vector-borne diseases, as well as a decreased rate of growth of certain tropical plants and animals and increased rates of coral reef bleaching. A 2010 synthesis report of 122 different published studies by the US Environmental Protection Agency confirmed a consensus on the science of climate change among the world's top climate scientists and found that the scientific understanding of climate change has continued to strengthen since IPCC's fourth assessment in 2007. The report concluded that climate change is happening, and the evidence for change, and the causes behind it, are unequivocal. Additionally, the IPCC's Working Group I, which consists of hundreds of the world's leading scientists on climate change, wrote that “there is unequivocal evidence of a warming trend for over 100 years, during which average surface temperatures have increased very slightly more than 0.8 degrees C.”. The report stated that surface temperatures in recent decades have been higher than any other time in the last 1000 years and that an increase in greenhouse gases of approximately 40% since 1900 has caused nearly all of the 0.8°C increase in surface temperatures. One Australian scientific study that used statistical modeling to track the global annual temperature measurements estimated that 97% of Earth's land surface area has warmed over the past 40 years, concluding that “the changes in the global climate system during the twentieth century are unprecedented during the last thousand years” and that a large majority of this warming has occurred since the mid-20th century. In a 2007 study, respected climate scientist, emeritus professor at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, and a retired expert reviewer for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, John R. Christy stated that the satellite temperature data from 1979 to present shows a slight cooling trend. However, Christy's claims were later shown to be misleading due to an incorrect statement in the satellite data record, and a claim of contradictory results as an irrelevant statistic. One analysis published in a peer-reviewed journal found that an even larger number of scientists were in favor of anthropogenic climate change than found by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and The BAMS Essential Guide to Climate Change, written by a section editor of the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, put the consensus at 97-98%. The consensus on climate change among earth and atmospheric scientists is

97	 First paragraph
98	 Here is some text: The problem with your argument is humans have been wrong with a lot of ideas. It is quite possible the scientists are wrong in the case of humans causing climate change. I find most of your argument fits under the ad populum fallacy. " Just because the majority of scientists think man made climate change is real and a threat, does not mean the scientists are correct. At one time we thought the Earth was flat and the sun revolved around the Earth. (Kepler believed the earth did not revolve around the sun, but rather the sun and the stars orbited the earth. He was so convinced of this that he came up with a great theory of astronomy that got him famous. Later observations, such as Galileo's, showed that Kepler's explanation was correct, and people started to believe that the earth was the center of the solar system. ) " "Does the Earth go around the Sun, or does the Sun go around the Earth?" If you answered the latter, you're among a quarter of Americans who also got it wrong, according to a new report by the National Science Foundation. " [3] There is a chance that the entire global warming/climate change is a scam. That the deniers are whistle blowers. If we start jailing whistle blowers we could be in a lot of trouble. [4] Remember that 97% of climate change scientists agree. That means 3% don't, and those 3% could be legitimate whistle blowers. Some of the scientist claim there is bullying going on to reach the consensus. [5] There is talk of data manipulation. [6] Honestly, I will not stoop by backing up the deniers. I think the chances of the deniers being wrong is at least 99%. Nevertheless, there is that 1% chance. The deniers may be mistaken and, with them in jail, it is unlikely they would point it out. Finish the debates. Back off and give me a chance to respond. I disagree with your assertion that I didn't respond to your last post. Also, you didn't respond to the rest of my arguments. (I noticed they are now gone) You broke the debate rules. If you didn't want to respond to all of my arguments I asked for a 30 hour rule. Once again, rebutting r2, 3, 4, and 5. I'll let you rebut r6 and let the voters decide. I will concede if you want to stop the debate. I will return the favor and not vote in any of your debates. I am not losing anything on this debate. I am just trying to promote the supporters of one side against jailing those who disagree with the other side. Don't worry about me. I won't be retaliating to your spamming. Do what you want. I hope to see a lot more debates from you. Good luck on your debate against Rock_Paper_Scissors. I have no power, you are free to do whatever you like in your eyes, I won't help you. It is my decision on your punishment. If I think you should be punished, I will judge accordingly. If the vote goes against you, tough luck. If I think you deserve punishment for breaking the rules, I will deal with that after the debate. If you follow the debate rules, I will respond. 1) If you are unwilling to simply concede, then fine, let's continue then. 2) You did not discuss R6 AT ALL, and did not agree with me on it, when I originally rebutted you, therefore you did not rebut it, then it is dropped. 3) You did not rebut r2 4) You did not rebut r3 5) You did not rebut r4 6) you did not rebut r5, you only said (6) is bogus, which is a non-argument. 7) you did not rebut r6 8) you did not rebut the round 9) you did not rebut round 3 I rebutted all your rounds, but you didn't rebut my.

This does not mean that you do. {Most scientists do not believe in the circular reasoning (or perhaps circular tautology) of having to pass consensus in order to be recognized as a scientist, no matter what position you hold within the field.

100	 Greetings! Thank you for this debate, this should be fun! In accepting this debate I do not pretend to stand for all of feminism seeing as there are many different sects of the movement. I also do not claim to know everything about feminism. I will use sources from the internet as well as books to support my argument. First, we must define Feminism. There are many different types of feminism. For example: Antiporn feminism, Cultural Feminism, Hip Hop feminism, Lesbian Feminism, Queer feminism, and Radical feminism. The feminism it seems you disagree with is the one that is prevalent in the Pink Hat movement. But my stance will be from the Antiporn and Cultural Feminist movements. These movements advocate the reality: Women are more nurturing, cooperative, and communicative. Instead of measuring themselves against men, women should make their own activities more visible and valued. The dehumanization of women is seen in pornography and the prejudice held against abortion and sexually active women. This prejudice is systemic, and women are systematically devalued. We are constantly pressured to have families (with men) and men have a high sex drive which increases the likelihood of rape. This higher sex drive for men makes it socially acceptable for them to be sexually active with as many women as possible. So often women are objectified as sexual beings only rather than as women with complex lives and desires. How is this what has "gone too far"?

103	 Feminism consists of two central ideologies: Anti-pornography feminism and Cultural feminism. The largest and most prominent subsection of this movement is what can be called contemporary American feminism. "Feminism seeks to define, establish, and achieve equal rights and equal opportunities to men, regardless of their gender, without compromising their femininity.". Radical feminism, as defined by radical feminist Chis Bott, "is a global social movement to end sex-based oppression. It sees men and women as equals who deserve equal opportunities and equal treatment, regardless of their sex. It is both a rejection of essentialist claims that have been used to oppress women, and an assertion of the importance of feminine experience and difference. Radical feminism is also a critique of patriarchy, and as such challenges the idea that the binary organization of gender is natural, that one’s gender is determined by biological or universal social forces. Instead, it posits that gender is socially constructed, and questions the creation of identities and stereotypes which ascribe and deny women and men different roles as a result of their biological sex. (Wikipedia)
104	 I know this debate is a few years old but I thought it important to reply. Feminism is not a monolithic group of people with the same views or goals. What you are saying is generally true but there are different kinds of feminism. Some Feminists want change within the existing state, others believe in complete social and political revolutions, and some would want to destroy patriarchy altogether. There are also a few views within feminism regarding rape. But there are still many beliefs that transcend gender (provided the views are backed by scientifically tested evidence). It is totally understandable to think that men and women have different behaviours, but research also shows that there are multiple areas in which men and women do the same or have similar abilities, and only in very few areas do men have an advantage. It may be that women are more nurturing, cooperative and communicative, but that doesn’t mean that they should just settle for that. They should not merely make their own activites more visible and valued, but they should not become less than a human being. Cultural feminists believe that we all need to change, not just women, and focus on cooperative relationships between men and women. Hip Hop feminists are concerned with hip hop culture and how the media portrays women. Antiporn feminists object to pornography and it's degrading portrayal of women. Radical Feminists (also called red flag feminists) seek to do away with the patriarchy altogether (the root of all evils for them) and favour complete social and political revolutions. The Radical Feminists you’ve mentioned are the same ones who believe that the binary of masculine and feminine is simply what men want, and therefore should not exist. They are overly-paranoid, on the basis of that alone, are not of particular use to the debate. I’m going to shamelessly quote a post from this site (http://wecantgolf.com/1473/the-feminist-agenda): "There is a fairly controlling feminist agenda that is trying to sneak its way into every aspect of our lives. From the everyday things like the articles written in all the magazines, their advertisements, any comedy specials or movies to the

109	 I am A Man and I am a Feminist. Feminism is a phasing in of equal rights, as men also were adversely affected by sexism, especially during The Age of Slavery, and The Age of Machismo. From The Age of Machismo to the Current Age of Gay rights and political correctness, Feminism has indeed led to more enlightened approaches to gender. To be a Feminist is to work towards the phasing in of more gender equality, NOT simply taking advantage of gender disparities in public or private. Being A Feminist In itself DOES NOT make one a Slut. Please do not interpret this debate as attacking a Slutty Person, A Slut Is To Be fought Against, in all walks of life, because A Slut can be ANY gender. I ask again, that you, as a Member of Parliament Of The Australian nation, show respect and empathy to all human beings by recognising them as human beings, and not treating those who take offense as if they are responsible for causing offense. 
110	 Con stated that that the Merriam-Webster dictionary is unreliable because it is biased. Con's reasoning for this was that the dictionary was made in "liberal" Massachusetts. Con has provided no evidence to support that it is made in Massachusetts, or how the location of the dictionary company proves that it is unreliable. Until Con proves this connection, my definition of Feminism still stands. Yet I will make it even more difficult for Con. Here are many more authoritative definitions of Feminism: Oxford Dictionary - "The advocacy of women's rights on the ground of equality of the sexes" [3] Cambridge Dictionary - "The belief that women should be allowed the same rights, power, and opportunities as men" [4] Macmillan Dictionary - "The belief that women should have the same rights and opportunities as men" [5] Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English - "The belief that women should have the same rights and opportunities as men" [6] Collins English Dictionary - "A doctrine or movement that advocates equal rights for women equal to those of men" [7] Dictionary.com - "The doctrine advocating social, political, and all other rights of women equal to those of men" [8] For Con to prove that the definition of Feminism is not about equality, Con must prove that each and every one of the dictionaries above is an unreliable source. If Con cannot, then this debate must concede that Feminism is about equality between men and women by definition. I suggest an alternative viewpoint: A) Feminism is about the equality between men and women, as defined in all the sources above. B) Anyone seeking to gain more than equality is not practicing Feminism (as per the definition) C) There are people who falsely use the Feminism banner to attempt to gain more than equality D) Those who falsely use the Feminism banner should be condemned E) True Feminism (gender equality) is an ideal and should be supported As I mentioned in Round 2, I support equality between men and women. Therefore, I am for Feminism. Con has stated that Con is an "equalist" and is "for the rights of men AND women". Therefore, like me, Con is for Feminism as defined in the dictionaries.

111	 Con stated that that the Merriam-Webster dictionary is unreliable because it is biased. The Merriam-Webster dictionary was founded in 1831 in Springfield, Massachusetts, a city in "liberal" America. Con has provided no evidence to support that the dictionary is made in Massachusetts or that it is biased. Until Con proves this connection, my definition of Feminism still stands. Yet I will make it even more difficult for Con. Here are many more authoritative definitions of Feminism: Oxford Dictionary - "The advocacy of women's rights on the ground of equality of the sexes" [3] Cambridge Dictionary - "The belief that women should be allowed the same rights, power, and opportunities as men" [4] Macmillan Dictionary - "The belief that women should have the same rights and opportunities as men" [5] Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English - "The belief that women should have the same rights and opportunities as men" [6] Collins English Dictionary - "A doctrine or movement that advocates equal rights for women equal to those of men" [7] Dictionary.com - "The doctrine advocating social, political, and all other rights of women equal to those of men" [8] Here are even more authoritative sources. Please don't try to refute this, because it won't work. The sources I provided and below prove that the definition of Feminism is about equality between men and women: http://www.merriam-webster.com... http://www.merriam-webster.com... http://www.merriam-webster.com... http://dictionary.cambridge.org... http://dictionary.cambridge.org... http://www.macmillandictionary.com... http://www.merriam-webster.com... http://dictionary.cambridge.org... http://www.ldoceonline.com... http://www.collinsdictionary.com... http://www.macmillandictionary.com... http://www.macmillandictionary.com... http://www.ldoceonline.com... http://www.ldoceonline.com... http://dictionary.cambridge.org... Con's Reverse Burden - If Con can prove that the definition of Feminism is not about equality, then Con wins. Con knows that Feminism was coined by the patriarchy, which hates men. First, by gender equality, does Con simply mean equal rights or also equal opportunities and responsibilities? Well done for your rebuttals. I will rebut the points I used above and rebut Con's answers. 1. Oppressed or Not Oppressed - This is immaterial to me as it does not mean oppressed if Pro didn't wish to prove that Women weren't oppressed. So perhaps Pro should have tried to prove that women were oppressed or that no women were oppressed. 2. Feminism is a Label - The meaning of Feminism is like any other label as it merely states that the person is Feminist or accepts the ideas of Feminists. Pro's sources seem to me to be rather out of date: The Oxford Dictionaries being the oldest at 22. Pro now has a slightly easier task as the argument is at Con and Pro. So I have read over the sources that Pro used and will only directly refute the text in quotes. Pro has pointed out, in his second quote, that the Modern Dictionary was created in 2003. Most of Pro's Sources were created before that. I have to note that I really don't like Oxford Dictionaries. They were a rather controlling force in the past and refused to add certain entries due to being outdated or 'not fit for purpose'. "In 1984, Oxford Dictionaries admitted that it would not add the word "computer" to its dictionary for another 200 years as it was "more secure not to define words which people do not fully understand."[1]" "If OED is talking about the actual science or the philosophy of computers, then that's perfectly fine: the point is to define what a word means when used in context.[2]" "While many modern dictionaries discuss the origins of frugal in the same section as the adjective, their tendencies to consider early definitions to be the correct ones (or at least the ones to discuss) result in etymologies based on outdated lexicographical standards.[4]" "25. Authority - It is a huge problem in Oxford Dictionaries to trust their words based on the authority they provide. Their claims of having references to over 6 million, and 40,000 scholarly references is extremely inaccurate and misleading. 26. Dictionary Controversies - They have so many Dictionary Controversies listed on their site to avoid answering the questions they should be answering and trying to scare people away from looking at their content and past lexicographical standards. If Oxford Dictionaries was so proud of the quality of their definitions, they should have long ago recognized the validity of the attacks on them and corrected their errors rather than reiterating definitions that don't match reality for
112	 Con stated that that the Merriam-Webster dictionary is unreliable because it is biased. Con's reasoning for this was that the dictionary was made in "liberal" Massachusetts. Con has provided no evidence to support that it is made in Massachusetts, or how the location of the dictionary company proves that it is unreliable. Until Con proves this connection, my definition of Feminism still stands. Yet I will make it even more difficult for Con. Here are many more authoritative definitions of Feminism: Oxford Dictionary - "The advocacy of women's rights on the ground of equality of the sexes" [3] Cambridge Dictionary - "The belief that women should be allowed the same rights, power, and opportunities as men" [4] Macmillan Dictionary - "The belief that women should have the same rights and opportunities as men" [5] Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English - "The belief that women should have the same rights and opportunities as men" [6] Collins English Dictionary - "A doctrine or movement that advocates equal rights for women equal to those of men" [7] Dictionary.com - "The doctrine advocating social, political, and all other rights of women equal to those of men" [8] For Con to prove that the definition of Feminism is not about equality, Con must prove that each and every one of the dictionaries above is an unreliable source. If Con cannot, then this debate must concede that Feminism is about equality between men and women by definition. I suggest an alternative viewpoint: A) Feminism is about the equality between men and women, as defined in all the sources above. B) Anyone seeking to gain more than equality is not practicing Feminism (as per the definition) C) There are people who falsely use the Feminism banner to attempt to gain more than equality D) Those who falsely use the Feminism banner should be condemned E) True Feminism (gender equality) is an ideal and should be supported
113	 My opponent states that it is not his primary goal for women to be equal to men. He states that while it is an "ideal", "it is not attainable". Con quotes Margaret Atwood "That’s the point; it’s not a choice. Not a choice between equal and not equal; it’s a choice between being human and not being human." Con claims that he does not wish to strip women of any of their rights; however, it is clear to me that Con is saying that women should not be equal to men. Since we have established that Feminism is indeed about gender equality in all spheres, I maintain that his position of not being equal to men is not aligned with that of Feminism. Con claims that true Feminism is an ideal and should be supported. Con acknowledges that Feminism is supported and he should consider himself fortunate that he is in a position where he can afford to condemn the non-idealist Feminism. I call upon Con to re-evaluate his position in this regard.
114	 Con's argument that the definition of Feminism is unreliable because Merriam-Webster's dictionary is "made in liberal Massachusetts" is not only a weak case, it's completely factually incorrect. [Here is the dictionary's location (so that Con can check it out for himself): http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/feminism]] No Con was able to find the Merriam-Webster dictionary where it is stated to be "made in liberal Massachusetts". Even without independent verification of the veracity of Con's assertion, the definition of Feminism is still the dictionary one and Con has yet to prove that Feminism is not about equality. Con's definition of Feminism is as follows: "Feminism seeks the equity of rights between men and women. Conceptions of what "equal rights" encompass differ, but popular movements such as legal and social rights for women, or full suffrage, have been common elements." Let's make a map of the definitions: [Image:] SJW and privilege theory believe that feminism is equality between men and women. Con has stated that feminism is equity between men and women which is an inequality (men have rights women don't). Con has further stated that equality does not "equate equity". Con has provided no argument why "equal right" doesn't equate "equal right" when the dictionary says it does. Furthermore, all the dictionaries state Feminism is a doctrine or movement. Con has provided no argument that feminism is "a movement" when it is defined as doctrine, not a "movement". Similarly, Con has no argument about feminism "a doctrine" being different from "a movement". Con has made no substantive argument that contradicts any the substantive assertions feminism is equality of the definition. Con's analysis, thus far, is basically that "Con can't possibly be wrong". This is fallacious reasoning. Con needs to provide reasoned argument about why the dictionary definition is incorrect. Con then goes on to conflate equality and equity saying, {here are some quotes that will show my point. Firstly, "here are some quotes from the Webster dictionary, that as Pro Conceded proves are unreliable". This statement is wrong as I proved Pro's Dictionary is reliable in my last round. "Con infers what equality means when he says that "Conceptions of what "equal rights" encompass differ". Actually the only thing I am inferring is that what men can do so can women. I am not basing that conclusion on any studies or theories, but rather I am basing it on logic. Regardless, even if a fallacy, I think my proof was strong enough to counter it. 
115	 Con has argued dictionaries do not authoritatively define words, but has given no proof of this. Con's presented only one argument in this entire debate "Since'masculinism' is male supremacy, then feminism is female supremacy." without giving any evidence to back the claim that words with similar roots cannot have different meanings. Furthermore, Con didn't provide any source of definition for Masculinism, so Con's argument is not sound. --- I have offered six authoritative sources stating that Feminism is the movement for equality between men and women. I am for equality between men and women. I am for Feminism. According to Con, Con is an "equalist" and is "for the rights of men AND women". Therefore, Con is also for Feminism.

I have offered six authoritative sources stating that Feminism is the movement for equality between men and women. Con has offered nothing but insults, dishonesty and straw man tactics in reply. Con has not refuted any of my arguments. I am for equality between men and women. I am for Feminism. Therefore, Con is also for Feminism. The statement of debate is "Feminism". I have proven I am Pro. Con's evidence for Masculinism is not evidence for Feminism. This debate is over.

120	 You claim that feminism encourages false rape accusations and stereotyping men as bad. I admit that false rape accusations occur and that there are stereotypes of men being bad, but this isn't what feminism is at all. Feminism is the doctrine advocating social, political, and all other rights of women equal to those of men, and you admit that equal rights is good. By this definition, you are a feminist. There are false rape claims. Maybe you are a feminist, but feminists are not evil. I assume you disagree that there is a systematic discrimination against women, the patriarchy. Is there a patriarchy? A definition that is commonly used, it means a system where men are valued over women[2]. This can be shown in the wage gap[3], rape culture[4] (though men can be victims of rape, rape culture usually targets women), and gender roles[5]. I could be wrong about rape culture. Only 1.5-8% of rape reports are fake[7], and it's only between 2% and 10% for false accusations[8]. As I said earlier, I could be wrong about rape culture, but I really doubt it. The sexual assault or rape victims are less likely to report. Why? Because 90% of rapists know their victim and 72% are friends or acquaintances, and even they 60% of victims report abuse, and 97% of abusers will not see jail[6]. If you are going to disagree then I would have to ask you to go to timeout because the idea is wrong and what you are saying is childish. At the same time, if we are going of the definition of feminism I stated earlier, feminists don't try to put men as stereotypically bad. We are trying to make men and women equal. If you think that trying to remove the bias towards men is trying to say they are bad, then I am going to have to ask you go to timeout because that idea is downright childish. In the end, there you say something about "calling the police about something ridiculous is obscure". I think you mean absurd, but if you didn't then I'm not sure what that would mean. If it is obscure, then false rape accusations don't happen often and thus shouldn't be a problem. If you meant absurd, then I would agree that false rape accusations are deplorable, but again I would say that false rape reports aren't a tenant of feminism nor are they a likely to occur, and I could be wrong about rape culture.
121	 You claim that feminism encourages false rape accusations and stereotyping men as bad. Um... No, that's not what feminism is at all. Feminism is the doctrine advocating social, political, and all other rights of women equal to those of men[1].
122	 You claim that feminism encourages false rape accusations and stereotyping men as bad. Um... No, that's not what feminism is at all. Feminism is the doctrine advocating social, political, and all other rights of women equal to those of men[1]". Now, you admit that this is something you are for, so I guess you have problems with how feminists go about this? Really, I think your entire argument stems from a complete misunderstanding of the movement. So, what is feminism? This is a difficult question because, much like religion, feminism is different for each feminist. The mission statement of the movement is equal rights between the sexes, which you agree is good. By this definition, you are a feminist. If you could indicate how you aren't a feminist, that'd be appreciated. Maybe you disagree that there is a systematic discrimination against women, the patriarchy. Is there a patriarchy? Well, as it commonly seems to be the case, I must define "the patriarchy". Basically, it means a system where men are valued over women[2]. This can be shown in the wage gap[3], rape culture[4] (though men can be victims of rape, rape culture usually targets women), and gender roles[5].

Rebuttals: What you are saying here is very dangerous. Stating that feminism promotes false rape accusations is an example of rape culture. 60% of victims report abuse, and 97% of abusers will not see jail[6]. Only 1.5-8% of rape reports are fake[7], so Puh-LEASE do not try and say that considerable amount of rape reports are fake and that we should cast doubt on those few that come forward. If we are going of the definition of feminism I stated earlier, then feminists aren't trying to put men as stereotypically bad. We are trying to make men and women equal. If you think that trying to remove the bias towards men is trying to say they are bad, then I am going to have to ask you go to timeout because that idea is downright childish.

124	 The phrase "the patriarchy" is used to describe a system where men are valued over women [note: this doesn't state that it's only men who value other men]. This can be shown in the wage gap, and rape culture and gender roles. In the United States, a man earns $1.01 for every dollar that a women makes. This is because employers know that men are seen as more valuable than women. Similarly, at my high school, it is rare for a woman to enter the "higher" science and math classes, but men could be awarded for taking the lower level ones. Rape culture and gender roles are also ways that men are put above women. When looking at the issue of rape, while 60% of victims report abuse, 97% of abusers will not see jail [8], making it rare that one will be convicted. Only 1.5-8% of rape reports are fake [9], so Puh-LEASE do not try and say that significant amount of rape reports are fake and that we should cast doubt on those few that come forward. If we are going of the definition of feminism I stated earlier, then feminists aren't trying to put men as stereotypically bad. We are trying to make men and women equal. If you think that trying to remove the bias towards men is trying to say they are bad, then I am going to have to ask you go to timeout because that idea is downright childish. In the end, if this is the type of thing you can cite in order to go against feminism, then I have to disagree with you. In the end, I think you are missing the fundamental idea behind feminism, and I think if you went with some other arguments they would be more fruitful. But that is just my opinion.
125	 To my opponent, "redefining terms" only works when your opponent agrees with your definitions. The term feminism has been used to describe different movements and meanings. Both you and I have used the definition of it that fits this debate. My opponent uses the definition of feminism that lacks the word equal. Since I am using the accepted definition for this debate, anything feminism and equal are used in any debate, or even any text, will not apply to our debate. Feminism is actually the opposite of this debate. Thus, neither one of us can accurately describe feminism. Further, even if my opponent wants to try to twist this debate into "con" vs. equal, he offers nothing to refute my arguments. If my opponent truly had an argument to make in this debate, he would have offered it and not merely offered a biased opinion, false sources, and basically no evidence to support his claim that feminism needs to disappear as soon as it has a large success in first world countries. Many first world countries still lack true equality between men and women. I will offer only one point regarding this debate: Most of us here in the first world countries already understand that equality between the sexes should prevail and therefore I will not go into an in-depth point about this topic. I will finish this debate by saying that my opponent's entire argument was poorly put together and overall irrelevant to our debate. My opponent offered poorly sourced evidence and a poorly constructed argument for why feminism should disappear. Since feminism represents oppression, it will never disappear once equality is reached, as oppression simply cannot exist once equality exists. My opponent had little more than a few opinions to offer, yet I submitted a full-out debate which has given my opponent no reason to forfeit. Regardless of the fact that my opponent failed to offer a reasonable argument, he still accepted this debate under the condition of offering a reasonable argument. I highly doubt that he will take anything back as he has now forfeited a round and effectively committed to this debate based on his own original statements and definitions which only support what I have argued. Thus, I would ask the voters to take a look at my opponent's final round. It would appear that my opponent's entire argument is an irrelevant forfeit based on the only argument he makes, "I have said it and I will say it again; It's time for women and men to act like men and women." This is a poorly supported argument and one that should be considered as coming from my opponent accepting the terms of this debate based on his own statements, that I did not make, but that still match my own arguments and I would like to direct the voters to my opponent's own round because if the voters take a look at it, they will see that it is hardly a reasonable argument. This is it, all my opponent has said. Furthermore, I will point out again that my opponent's argument is no more than an obvious appeal to emotion. He has not shown proof of why he is correct, or even that he is correct, just that he wants to. Simply saying, "I want it," is not an argument that should win. He is fully in support of the ideas that feminists fight against which is how it is that they remain a part of modern society. My opponent's own argument is without merit and thus, against the spirit of the debate as set by my opponent and against the rules of the website. Since my opponent's entire argument could be copied and pasted into one paragraph, there is no need to reword or clarify anything for him. I have summed up all of his arguments in one paragraph, so I am finished with this debate.
126	 As per the rules of the debate as set by my opponent, this will be my final argument. Since my opponent has failed to formulate a response, I see little need to elaborate much on my previous post. I will merely offer a brief summary of my arguments and this debate as a whole. My opponent claims that feminism is an incorrect argument. While I don't consider feminism an argument, I accepted the debate under these terms so I will argue as such. My opponent has offered nothing but an unsupported opinion regarding what he believes is feminism; a term of which he seems to lack a full understanding. There were no parameters set for this debate in terms of a place in which we were arguing, yet my opponent seems to have focused his argument purely on feminism in the United States. In fact, he basically conceded the debate by stating "in 1st world countries such as the USA, there should be no such thing as a feminist. The same can not be said for 3rd world countries, where women rights have not been established and women often have to be near a man to go anywhere in the city." Had we focused this debate on USA or first world countries alone, that statement would not be considered a concession, but the fact that we did not specify those terms shows that my opponent agrees that feminism is at least necessary in some places. Now let's ignore the fact that Con conceded the debate already and pretend we were just addressing first world countries. Con offers no sources to show that equality now fully exists, nor does he provide and decent explanation as to why feminism should disappear once success has been found. The fact of the matter is, inequality between the sexes still exists, as I showed in my previous round, and even once equality is reached here, feminism will still be important to help maintain that equality and to help spread the ideology throughout the countries where help is needed. Finally, if my arguments and sources are not enough to convince the reader, the fact that Con has only provided one poorly written paragraph backed by no sources, merely opinions, followed by a forfeited round should be enough to win me this debate. I would like to thank the readers for taking the time to read this debate.

130	 Here is some text: {Yes certainly. But friend, simply giving your opinion on a topic isn't how you start or maintain a debate. You have to make a claim (or take a stance) on the issue and then give evidence and examples to back up that claim. In my last post, I was just explaining two types of feminism and their views. But since I was confused, I am taking back the first stance I made and am taking the side of Radical feminism (the movement that does these things you mentioned such as "main spreading" and "hepeating"). Radical feminism is a movement whose main focus and objective is to challenge oppressive systems within society. This is incredibly important, as this revolutionary idea is what the United States government is based upon.

134	 Yes, I'm not quite sure what you mean by "in the back pocket." Could you please be more specific and elaborate? Nevertheless, my point is that in every governmental body, there is a set of rights protected within it. This is known as the 3 branches of government, each branch having its own powers, and the powers balancing each other out. I agree that there are also other aspects of government such as checks and balances and what not. However, Radical Feminism is a movement whose main focus and objective is to challenge oppressive systems within society. This is incredibly important, as this revolutionary idea is what the United States government is based upon. We may have a system of checks and balances in government, but having one in society (such as this sect of Feminism) in order to keep certain people groups from having too much power is equally important, even if it may be annoying at times.
135	 I agree with you that feminism is need in countries where women are oppressed and have little rights, but you must consider the conditions of the countries economies and social interactions because such a movement where they say one day "Women now have the ability of free will under no circumstances can there husbands control what they do." This could start massive revolts that would massacre women and could cause a rebellion against these weak 3rd world countries. Before feminism even comes to these countries, slow progressive changes must be made to deal with each conflict differently. You are very correct that feminism if no longer needed in 1st world countries like the US, but first democracy and peace must reach these areas. Much of these middle eastern countries make these laws due to Islamic influence, as Muslims believe that a woman must cover herself and listen to her husband. What these countries misinterpreted is how Islam doesn't state that husbands have complete control over their wives. Maybe a large religious event where a powerful person gives a touching speech talking about the word of Allah and how his true vision of an Islamic society would be that warms the hearts of Islamic country leaders and somehow influences them to establish laws that establish if not democratic rights or laws, feminism in the country
136	 I agree with you that feminism is not needed in countries like these, where men oppress women and have little rights. But I think you should consider the economy and social interaction of the countries. The result of such a movement in which one day women say, "Now we women have the right to act independently without oppression or command from men," could start mass revolutions against these weak countries in the third world, which could cause the killing of women and the possibility of an uprising against the women and the revolution leaders. Feminism still needs to come to countries like the United States, as well as all Western countries, but this will only be truly attained when the countries democracy and peace is established. These conflicts of the Muslim religion also must be addressed and perhaps addressed through one of the major leaders in the world, for he could greatly affect the many Muslim countries in both foreign and domestic affairs. The speech could be a great tool for the leaders of the nation to take into consideration the suggestions offered in the speech and start a nationwide movement to accept feminism to begin with.
137	 I agree with you that feminism is a key concept in countries that oppress their women, such as Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan. In this day and age feminism has gone past its use in 1st world countries, but it is needed in countries that still give women very few rights. 3rd world countries need slow progressive change and Western ideas to not create violent rebellions which could wipe out all women in the country. Western feminism has to be tempered before it is introduced to these countries. These countries need to understand feminism and how it is not about women oppressing their husbands. This understanding can be encouraged when influential Islamic speakers give speeches about the word of Allah and how his true vision of an Islamic society would be achieved. Such a speech could encourage the leadership of these countries to change their views of women, which could make Western feminism's ideas acceptable. 
138	 I agree with you that feminism is needed in countries where women are oppressed and have little rights, but you must consider the conditions of the countries economy and social interaction because such a movement where they say one day “Women now have the ability of free will under no circumstances can there husbands control what they do.” This could start massive revolts that would massacre women and could cause a rebellion against these weak third world countries. Before feminism even comes to these countries, slow progressive changes must be made to deal with each conflict differently. You are very correct that feminism is no longer needed in first world countries like the US, but first democracy and peace must reach these areas. Much of these middle eastern countries make these laws due to Islamic influence, as Muslims believe that a woman must cover herself and listen to her husband. What these countries misinterpreted is how Islam doesn’t state that husbands have complete control over their wives. Maybe a large religious event where a powerful person gives a touching speech talking about the word of Allah and how his true vision of an Islamic society would be that warms the hearts of Islamic country leaders and somehow influences them to establish laws that establish if not democratic rights or laws, feminism in the country

140	 This round will be less of a preface, more of an argument. The premises I put forth in the first round were challenged, but that was not the main goal of that round. Rather, it was there to prove that my opponent's definition of feminism is flawed, and that feminism was indeed based on the equality of the sexes, unlike third-wave feminism. I will be trying to prove that feminism was never meant to be an attack on men, as such attack is not the remedy to inequality. First, let's look at third-wave feminism. It, when looking into the definition of it (http://en.wikipedia.org...). I showed that the definition means that feminism no longer advocates equality for the sexes, but is an attack on men. Also, let's take a look at a quote from a third-wave feminist writer: "I think the assumption that feminists believe that men and women are intrinsically different plays a part in the ongoing suppression of the feminist agenda. Feminism does not believe men and women are equal. In fact, it is feminist ideology that led us to this rather violent questioning of what we were raised to accept as normal." This idea that men and women are different does indeed stem from sexist beliefs, but it is a very basic truth that women have a greater capacity to bear children, and that fathers play a very large role in their children's upbringing. However, third-wave feminists refuse to acknowledge these scientific truths and, instead, continue to attack men. Take a look at this video to see how they call for men to be stripped of their basic rights, all due to the fact that they are male (http://www.youtube.com...). This is what I call a hateful movement. I cannot possibly respect women who support this movement. I do not want my sisters to disrespect men and call for violence and hate, because that is not at all healthy (http://www.youtube.com...). Thus, I am female, yet I cannot support such a movement. Furthermore, I believe feminists trying to prove their equality by saying that men shouldn't have a voice due to being the dominate sex is doing more harm to women than good. I agree with my opponent that women are discriminated against in this day and age, and that they must fight for their equality. But what does a hateful movement bring to the table? I believe feminists must work together and fight side by side, men and women alike, and NOT attack men in order to "avenge" women. Otherwise, we have nothing to avenge.
141	 Thank you for the response, especially since you had a bad internet connection. Let me refute your points. First off, I reject your definition of feminism. I think feminism was the belief that men and women should be equal, but I proved that this is no longer the case in third wave feminism. I also reject your premise, because I stated in my first argument that MODERN feminism is harmful. My opponent has implied that it is the fault of men today that women weren't allowed to vote in some states until 1919. It was wrong that this happened, but taking revenge on men won't solve anything. In fact, it will cause embitterment between both sexes. Your first argument is invalid, because I never said that men and women weren't intellectually equal (although they generally don't have as much physical strength as men do). So, then it follows that they are not intellectually equal, making your point even more irrelevant than it was. And again, you can't blame the phrasing of the Declaration of Independence on men born two centuries after it was created. I don't think you have won this debate. Maybe I am wrong though. Maybe you can prove yourself in the second round. Good luck http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov... (source for men's vs. women's strength)
142	 I reject your definition of feminism. I believe that feminism in third wave feminism is harmful. I also reject your premise. I believe that men and women are not intellectually equal, but rather are equal physically (source 1). In addition, men's and women's strengths are different (source 2)
143	 I reject your "sources" because they come from people who consider themselves feminists and therefore have a vested interest in female-favoring. At the end of the day, research and truth are based on reliable sources, and it appears that these just aren't. Here is some text: I am going to counter each of your points now.

145	 Hello Ilan. I look forward to a productive exchange of ideas. I do apologize, but my response for this round won't be as elaborate since I wasn't able to respond sooner and I now have less than 15 minutes to answer lol The argument I present is that being egalitarian does not exclude you from being feminist. In fact, I argue that being feminist is a necessary condition for being egalitarian. You made valid points about the feminist movement and I think they are indeed to focused on giving women a better place in society, but I think they deviate slightly from the true meaning of feminism which seeks equality of the sexes.
146	 Hi Ilan. I really look forward to a productive exchange of ideas, but I'm late and have less than 15 minutes to answer lol The argument I present is that being egalitarian does not exclude you from being feminist. In fact, I argue that being feminist is a necessary condition for being egalitarian. "feminism is merely about getting equality for women whereas egalitarianism is equality for absolutely everybody." If egalitarianism means equality for absolutely everybody, as you stated, then it must include equality for women and therefore, feminism. You made valid points about the feminist movement and I think they are indeed too focused on giving women a better place in society, but I think they deviate slightly from the true meaning of feminism which seeks equality of the sexes.
147	 Hello Ilan. I am glad that we have the opportunity to communicate with each other and I look forward to a productive exchange of ideas. I apologize but I will not be able to submit my answer before 8pm today since I have only 15 minutes to respond and will have to leave shortly after to go to work. I promise I will try my hardest to turn this assignment in today. The argument I present is that being egalitarian does not exclude you from being feminist. In fact, I argue that being feminist is a necessary condition for being egalitarian. I see no problem at all with being a feminist and I think feminism is one of the best things that has ever happened in the world.
148	 Hi Ilan. I'm sorry if my response this round won't be as in-depth, but I really had only 15 minutes to answer. Anyways, my argument against this axi is that being an egalitarian does not exclude someone from being a feminist, and for that matter, a feminist is essential for egalitarianism. "feminism is merely about getting equality for women whereas egalitarianism is equality for absolutely everybody." If egalitarianism is about equality for everybody, which you state it is, then it must include equality for women, as feminism proposes. Also, another problem is that the pro-bono has ambiguous meaning, feminism could be inclusive of gender equality, but also equal rights and social justice. So, I was erring on the side of safety in my answer.

150	 Here is some text: {it seems my opponent escaped his first opportunity to start his argument, So i'll do it instead. Many people mistake feminism with misandry, However it isn't equal. My side is pro-feminism, Not pro-misandry. The definition is clear: FEMINISM:"the advocacy of women's rights on the basis of the equality of the sexes. " MISANDRY:"dislike of, Contempt for, Or ingrained prejudice against men (i. E. The male sex). " both groups of people may protest, But overall feminism still play the sane part. They just ask for equality and rights. Equality not absolute oligarchy. The things feminism may protest would be like: "STOP Gender Pay Gap! " "Girls Can Do This! " these types of people protests in an assertive way. They just ask for the line being pushed back to the center, Not all the way to the other side. They protest on a basis of women being less rightful, And they most likely won't make up a random scenario that women is already superior at such fields. on the other side, What we most likely to see, And what whom wanted the spotlight on themselves, Are the misandrists. They are less sane and more aggressive. Being mistaken for feminists, They actually push the fault onto the true feminists. such topics misandrists would argue are: "Men are stupid" "Girls should rule" all these leads to superiority and sexism, Not anything "sane". Notable feminists: (not necessarily, But they contribute to the women) Marie Curie(scientist):first woman to win a Nobel Prize, The first person and only woman to win twice, And the only person to win a Nobel Prize in two different sciences. " Hillary Clinton: Democratic Party's nominee for President of the United States in the 2016 election, The first woman nominated by a major party. Rosa Parks:"American activist in the civil rights movement best known for her pivotal role in the Montgomery bus boycott. The United States Congress has called her "the first lady of civil rights" and "the mother of the freedom movement". " Don't blame the fault of misandry to the feminism. These are 3( yes only 3) example of female empowerment and contribute against discrimination. What we see as misandrists discriminates, And are not equal to feminists. Feminists reduces discrimination
151	 it seems my opponent has escaped his first opportunity to start his argument, So i'll do it instead. Here is some text: {I am a big fan of dueling arguments and I know that an extensive amount of our debates consist of extensive duels with a great amount of eye candy, But it really does sort of takes away from the structure and content of the debate. So to avoid this in the future, I am proposing two modes of debates: 1) Literature Only 2) Mandatory opening statements I think the key here would be both are equal burdens. So if I voted for Literature Only in this debate I would not be able to use my opening statement during that round and vice versa. This should force debaters to interact with the different arguments of the opponents round and generate a more fair debate. I understand how both readers and debaters view Literature Only but if my opponent’s mode is one of their themes or rhetorical strategies it should not be completely forfeited. I also think this will make Literature Only debates more fair, And it won't look like there's just one side contributing and one side having a grand excuse to respond all the time. Sorry if the formatting is bad in this portion of the debate as I am using my phone and was trying to keep this brief. I hope you take into consideration my suggestion of mandatory opening statements and literature only/full response debates. Please vote for Pro'. Res. Thanks, and have a good weekend
152	 it seems like my opponent escaped his first opportunity to start his argument. I'll use it now instead. I'm pretty sure my opponent knows what feminism is, Including misandry. The definition is clear: FEMINISM:Advocacy of the equal political, Economic, And social rights of women. MISANDRY:Anti-male prejudice, Pure and simple. Here's some specific issues that feminists generally care about: ENDING VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN, DECRIMINALIZING ADULTERY, DROPPING PATRIARCHY, DROPPING SEXISM, ENDING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, ENDING MALE OWNERSHIP OF WOMEN AND MARRIAGE, ENDING MISOGYNY, ENDING SEX AND GENDER POLITICS, ENDING STREET HARASSMENT, ENDING STEREOTYPING OF WOMEN, ENDING THE DEATH PENALTY, ENFORCING CERTAIN OVERT SEXIST ISSUES WITHIN SCHOOLS, EQUAL PAY, EQUAL PROTECTION, EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENTS, GETTING RID OF BODY INSECURITIES, GETTING RID OF DUALICISM OF SEXUALITY, GETTING RID OF DOMESTIC VOLUNTEER WORK, GETTING RID OF FEMICIDE, GETTING RID OF GENDER AS A COLOR, GETTING RID OF GENDER DEPREDATION, GETTING RID OF GENDERED LABELS, GETTING RID OF HARASSMENT AND DISCRIMINATION, GETTING RID OF STEREOTYPING, GETTING RID OF WAGE DISCREPANCY AND OVERT BIASES, GOING AFTER WOMEN DOWN THERE, HOW TO DEAL WITH PARTY SPERM, INSTANT DEATH PENALTY FOR DATING MEN, MALE ORGANIZED MISOGYNY AND ANTI-FEMINISM, MALE OBJECTIFICATION AND SUBJUGATION, MALE TORTURE OF WOMEN, MASTURBATION TORTURE, MASS MISOGYNY, MARRIAGE FREEDOM, RIDING OFF THE "T" TERM, AND STOP GENDER GENDER PAY GAP!
153	 it seems my opponent escaped his first opportunity to start his argument, I will resume now that my opponent has successfully "prosecuted" against his own evidence. Secondly, While feminism may protest, what they are saying is not, by any means, equal to the complaints that they make. Women do not want equality with men, They are asking for a lack of rights; rather then an equal playing field. For example, Just this week, A certain feminist group protested that women should have the ability to go topless at gay pride events; they want everyone to have this same ability, but it is not given. Thirdly, That feminists may protest the gender pay gap would not justify the discrimination itself. Just because they may protest doesn't mean the issues are equal; It only means the issues are unjust. Regardless, The need to bring up this gender pay gap as a justifiable argument is superfluous, Because equality should not be measured by gender. I.E: if a women in the army can not hold the position of the president of the United States, Then they do not deserve that position, And they are not equal to a man, But they still should be paid the same. The comparison that comes to mind when it comes to equality is two people at a race track. They are both racing their car at the same time, Their cars have the same ability to win, But only one is able to; both cars are of the same equality, but not of the same justification of a winner. If an officer had to shoot a felon and it killed a woman in the crossfire, That would not justify the fact that an officer could not kill the felon. Gender simply does not justify one equal human life to another's. Here are some of the significant things that feminism wants to make their injustice legal, And all of these want to eliminate the rights of men: [3. women being able to go topless without men being able to go topless;[4. No laws that punish sexual assault;[5. No laws that punish domestic violence;[6. All insensitive names for women be illegal;[7. Abortion in all of its situations;[8. "Only Legal Abortion" would be the only law[9. Anyone that spits on the ground gets arrest;[10. There should be no laws against any form of same sex marriage;[11. No laws against any form of prostitution;[12. More laws to prosecute and attack women for both domestic and sexual violence;[13. There should be no crime for not being able to afford your child;[14. There should be no laws against any form of nudity; [15. Can no longer punish "hate speech" for being a feminist or making claims that are against feminism; [16. Rules that allow abortion at any point during a pregnancy; [17. No laws that require a man to pay alimony; [18. Abortion should be available to women at any point; [19. Laws that forbid a woman to be a man, And there are more similar things; maybe instead of me reposting them, You may post them yourself.]. Here is an irrelevant rewrite of the text that is less than the original: {it seems my opponent has avoided my argument by providing his own points of dispute, While failing to answer any arguments that I had made. My opponent's points of dispute are irrelevant and unimportant, For what I am arguing are direct items that are more severe and are a direct violation of human rights. Secondly, The counter points that my opponent used were very inappropriate; he has not provided actual research that is relevant to this debate, Simply used points that are irrelevant. There is an extremely large amount of bias in the articles that he chose to bring up, To make this irrelevant. If my opponent wanted to continue with this debate, He should have actually shown two articles that would support his viewpoints; An article that believes that there should be equality, And not just an article that believes that women deserve more rights, Then counterpoints to the feminists's complaints. My opponent has misrepresented his cases; If my opponent wants to continue this debate, He should have actually showed how these are evidence, Rather than just written them in the first place. If these are evidence, Then the case would actually make sense, But simply having a case is not enough. Now, To further rebut my opponent, First, Both the media that my opponent used is ignorant. He listed off issues that would not justify a response for any reasonable human being, Second, If there should be equality, Then it is not reasonable to disregard one side. My opponent has not demonstrated how feminists is superior, But simply claimed that it was; thirdly, If feminists are not justified, It is safe to assume that their claims are not true. Lastly, It is not fair to treat someone as a weaker sex, And it is also not fair to mistreat someone. My opponent has not provided his claims; he has only provided the sources that claim the opposite of my opponent. Here are sources
154	 it seems like people in my opponent's side mistook feminism for misandry, However, feminism is not equal to misandry. My side is pro-feminism, Not pro-misandry.

155	 XD you request that someone argue that feminism is fair based on FACTS!?... I think we both know that's not possible because feminism is based completely on emotions and not statistics. I feel like you were hoping a real feminist would accept your challenge so you could destroy them... lets be honest, feminists aren't brave enough to go on a website and take up an argument by themselves. you would probably make a lot of good points, but you would lose because the feminist will just go and wine to their friends and get them to come back to her up. While I'm not a feminist, in fact I hate feminism, but I will be happy to represent a fair argument in there favor of there beliefs, regardless of how ignorant and retarded they might be XD I have dealt with a lot of feminists so I trust I can at least try to give you a good fight.

Okay -breaths deeply- lets do this... in the situation of two people getting divorced, and assuming the woman gets the children who pays alimony? the woman isn't going to pay alimony to herself! Ha ha men only ever pay alimony when the woman gets the children so I think your questions should be, why do women get the children more often. well it has been proved by science, history, and personal experience that women are better with children. men don't pay alimony because of sexism, they pay alimony because the situation just happens to favor women. I don't understand how people can say that feminism is man hating. it's not hateful of men it is hateful of hate towards women which happens to be more prevalent in men. (P.S. let me know if you thought I was going to go with that "feminism is the belief of equality" BS XD)
157	 XD you request that someone argue that feminism is fair based on FACTS!?... I think we both know that's not possible because feminism is based completely on emotions and not statistics. I feel like you were hoping a real feminist would accept your challenge so you could destroy them... lets be honest, feminists aren't brave enough to go on a website and take up an argument by themselves. You believe in another fight with “facts”? You cannot sway the massive influence of logic. (But i agree that you are not interested in logic... you say they do not matter because you do not use them on feminism. However, you do use them on western democracy... i wonder why that is? That isn't what I asked you for. I wanted you to compare feminism to western democracy in terms of being fair. My favorite part of your answer is how you declare that you are against feminism but for equal rights... by that logic, are you also in favor of slavery, apartheid, segregation and child labor? By “fair” do you mean fair to women or fair to women, children, slave owners and slavers? In America there was a woman that screwed over her husband for a half a billion dollars (she was found guilty in the court of law and lost a lot of money). If you will, as the NAFCJ “Family Court Judge”--you state in your answer that both parents should equally share in child support and alimony, but you also note that the woman in the example got more money from her ex husband than her ex husband got from her. So.......If it is fair, why does she get more than what her husband got? Since she was proven by a court of law to be in the wrong, she shouldn't have more.... Just as on a soccer field, if you are proven to be in the wrong, you do not get to keep the points. You gave them to the other team and you lost by that goal. You say in your reply: “it has been proved by science, history, and personal experience that women are better with children. men don't pay alimony because of sexism, they pay alimony because the situation just happens to favor women.” “Personal experience”? You are using personal experience, an argument for why women are better than men with children as evidence for the one argument in your favor. You are then undercutting your own argument. You cannot declare that men are automatically wrong, that is your stated discrimination. Given all your arguments, which ones are wrong? I will give you one: History and personal experience. You can be pro-woman by being pro-woman. It does not equal man hating. If I supported the Nation of Islam in their desire to rid America of the influence of Jewish culture, am I a racist because I value white culture? No. Just as you can support feminism, the for the valuing and preservation of women's culture, without being a man hater. For example: Women control the fertility of their body. Men cannot. Therefore since women have more control over their body, it is not a surprise that the situation of keeping children is in their favor. This does not prove men are wrong, but I can appreciate how this seems to imply a lack of respect for men. Is it possible that you could examine why women are better than men in this situation and respect them for that? He/she was not proved by a court of law to be in the wrong. The laws gave her the lion share of the assets because the man was proven to be in the wrong. The fact that the man was proven to be in the wrong has nothing to do with that. He didn't provide for the child. Hence the reason he is required to pay. This has no basis in western democracy at all. As stated previously, if we do not pay the parents
158	 You request that someone argue that feminism is fair based on FACTS!?... I think we both know that's not possible because feminism is based completely on emotions and not statistics. I feel like you were hoping a real feminist would accept your challenge so you could destroy them... lets be honest, feminists aren't brave enough to go on a website and take up an argument by themselves. You are trying to bully someone into confronting them? That's pretty shitty.

While I'm not a feminist, in fact I hate feminism, but I will be happy to represent a fair argument in there favor of there beliefs, regardless of how ignorant and retarded they might be XD I have dealt with a lot of feminists so I trust I can at least try to give you a good fight. A fair fight? How is this a fight? What would it mean for it to be "fair" or for the feminist to have some advantage in your eyes? What would it mean for you to "loose?" It's like you're encouraging her to get other people involved. If she doesn't have the balls to do it herself, why give her that opportunity? You want her to believe that she can't defend her own opinions and she must only rely on her friends to do that for her? A woman doesn't get the children more often - that is a lie. Children are granted to either gender whenever there are two options. Women are not "better" than men. Women have many very hard and unpleasant roles to fill on top of being mothers - they are caretakers and they do the vast majority of the housework. There is a limit to what some can do due to how little time and energy they have. Not only that but she is responsible for the care and safety of her child or children. She is responsible for the blood and tears that might flow during a fight between her and her partner, then she must heal it all up. If someone gets hurt, regardless of who it is, she must nurse them back to health. If they cannot do it themselves and cannot be restrained, she must be the calm voice of reason and help them through it. It is an insult to suggest that she is somehow not capable of doing those things due to her gender. She has a unique perspective and experience and using these helps her relate to what a man is thinking and feeling. Alimony is determined by a judge or jury - it is not decided by a father paying it to his ex wife. I can't believe how little you know about this stuff! Alimony is when they settle disputes through a judge and go through divorce proceedings in court. You just plainly don't know what you're talking about! I'm going to go ahead and assume that you had a very miserable upbringing and you're just reacting to your past experiences. Fanfiction is a poor outlet for this though. And if you were so discontent with that, perhaps you should've gone with the original text: the misrepresentation of the original text is exactly what you are attempting to dispute. The ineptitude of fanfic writers is only so bad when compared to yours. Christmas Party (PG-13) kjbleib liked this. Fav 5 posts of ALL TIME!

159	 XD you request that someone argue that feminism is fair based on FACTS!?... I think we both know that's not possible because feminism is based completely on emotions and not statistics. I feel like you were hoping a real feminist would accept your challenge so you could destroy them... lets be honest, feminists aren't brave enough to go on a website and take up an argument by themselves. you would probably make a lot of good points, but you would loses because the feminist will just go an wine to there friends and get them to come back her up. While I'm not a feminist, in fact I hate feminism, but I will be happy to represent a fair argument in there favor of there beliefs, regardless of how ignorant and retarded they might be XD I have dealt with a lot of feminists so I trust I can at least try to give you a good fight. Okay -breaths deeply- lets do this... in the situation of two people getting divorced, and assuming the woman gets the children who pays alimony? the woman isn't going to pay alimony to herself! Ha ha men only ever pay alimony when the woman gets the children so I think your questions should be, why do women get the children more often. well it has been proved by science, history, and personal experience that women are better with children. women don't pay alimony because of sexism, they pay alimony because the situation just happens to favor women. I don't understand how people can say that feminism is man hating. it's not hateful of men it is hateful of hate towards women which happens to be more prevalent in men.
160	 Hi everyone I'm Ilan and I am not a feminist. Immediately alarms would be ringing in your mind that maybe this guy is a "sexist" or "a rape apologist" or anything of the such so just to clarify I am none of these things. I firmly believe that in the idea that everyone should be equal no ifs and or buts. And now you might be thinking why is this guy not a feminist then? Well, the answer to that question is that feminism does not have a monopoly on equality; if you believe in equality you are not automatically a feminist as many feminists like to state. I am in fact an egalitarian. The difference between the two is that feminism is merely about getting equality for women whereas egalitarianism is equality for absolutely everybody. The dictionary definition of egalitarian is "believing in or based on the principle that all people are equal and deserve equal rights and opportunities." and that for feminism is "the advocacy of women's rights on the ground of the equality of the sexes.". Now that we have established some ground I can really start to get into why I am not a feminist. First of all, I am a man. And I am not trying to say that men cannot be feminists, but as a man, I feel that I should campaign for my sex and as we have already established feminism is not about gaining equality for all but helping just Women to achieve equality. Even feminists that say that men and other groups are included in feminist issues still do not really campaign for our problems. One major issue that men face is prostate cancer. Prostate cancer kills just as many people as breast cancer does but receives merely half the funding towards research and cures. I have never in my life met a feminist that has agreed with the statement "Prostate cancer is a feminist issue" because quite frankly it is not. Many feminists also like to say that MRAs (Men's Rights Activists) are the ones that should be campaigning for male problems but if it really is for everyone then why does feminism not cover everybody's problems. Here I have merely scratched the surface of male problems that feminism does not address such as the fact that 4 times more men commit suicide than women or that 70% of homeless people are estimated to be men or the significantly less jail time for female rapists than men. I could go on but I want to hear what everyone else has to say about this! I thank you for hearing out what I had to say if you made it this far and hope you all have a wonderful day. Ilan

162	 Hi everyone, I’m Ilan and I am not a feminist. [This is no issue, since it’s good to be open-minded. It’s OK to be in favour of equality, but not be a member of a specific gender/sex/faith/skin colour/ sexual orientation/political inclination group]. Immediately alarm bells may be ringing in your mind that maybe this guy is a "sexist" or "a rape apologist" or anything of the such so just to clarify I am none of these things. I firmly believe that in the idea that everyone should be equal no ifs and or buts. [Some people prefer not to use "no ifs and or buts", so I changed it to "no ifs and or buts" and added an extra "if" to "no ifs or buts".] And now you might be thinking why is this guy not a feminist then? [This is already becoming less engaging.] Well, the answer to that question is that feminism does not have a monopoly on equality; [This is a good opening.] if you believe in equality you are not automatically a feminist as many feminists like to state. I am in fact an egalitarian. [To be clear about what you are, please explain the difference between the two. What is the definition of an egalitarian? Don't just quote a dictionary definition. That's too long.] Egalitarian: [Not necessary] be having to do with or tending to equality or to be in favour of equal opportunities for all people, esp men and women. and that for feminism is [changed tense] the advocacy of women's rights on the ground of the equality of the sexes. [This doesn't make sense. You can't advocate for women's rights and be for equality, since men also want equality.] Now that we have established some ground [establishing ground is OK, but your opening is very long. It's better to cut it down.], I can really start to get into why I am not a feminist. First of all, I am a man [Delete this.]. And I am not trying to say that men cannot be feminists, [Delete this too.] be whatever the hell that you want, [This should read "be whichever gender you like" or "do whatever you want," or, if this is an essay, avoid all these sensitivities] but as a man, I feel that I should campaign for my sex and [Yup, sounds like a sexist opinion] as we have already established feminism is not about gaining equality for all but helping just Women to achieve equality. [Change this to "as we have already established, feminism is not about giving women special treatment just because they are women, but about giving them the same rights as everyone else."] Even feminists that say that men and other groups are included in feminist issues still do not really campaign for our problems. [Change this to "Even though feminists claim that men are involved in feminist issues, they really only campaign for their own issues and don't do enough to help men."] One major issue that men face is [This is a good sentence and seems OK. An essay might spend more time on a very specific situation that is not well known or well understood by most people. This is the equivalent to the essay question you are answering, and will be about 1/3 of the essay.] prostate cancer. Prostate cancer kills just as many people as breast cancer does but receives merely half the funding towards research and cures. [This is another good sentence. Again, it might make a good essay question, and may take up to 1/4 of the essay space.] I have never in my life met a feminist that has agreed with the statement "Prostate cancer is a feminist issue" because quite frankly it is not. Many feminists also like to say that [This is too speculative. Is this true? In the US? In Australia? In Europe? In Asia? It should be specific. Do you have any evidence?] MRAs (Men's Rights Activists) are the ones that should be campaigning for male problems but if it really is for everyone then why does feminism not cover everybody's problems. Here I have merely scratched the surface of male problems that feminism does not address such as the fact that [Deep breath] 4 times more men commit suicide than women [Too factual. Add some feeling and emotion, and avoid the word "facts"] or that 70% of homeless people are estimated to be men or the significantly less jail time for female rapists than men. I could go on but I want to hear what everyone else has to say about this! [And here, you have answered the question "Why isn't feminism more broad than just women's issues?" Keep this for the last paragraph, and give the person who is reading your essay some to say.] I thank you for hearing out what I had to say if you made it this far and hope you all have a wonderful day.

165	 I start by saying: Here is some text: (1) According to the rules, I can't make my rebuttal now, so I will skip directly to my second point: (2) Based on my opponent's definition, feminism is not sexist. Here is a link of feminism : feminism at the same time: (3) Now that I start to think about it, I don't really have a BoP, since my opponent is the one claiming that something (feminism) has a particular characteristic (sexist). What I need to do is prove that my opponent has not met his case and then apply my own arguments which I will do. (4) Reminder: Definition of feminism as stated by my opponent: '[Feminism is] The advocacy [or support thereof] of women’s rights on the ground of the equality of the sexes' Definition of sexism as stated by my opponent: "[Sexism is] Prejudice, stereotyping, or discrimination, typically against women, on the basis of sex" The definition of sexism contains three important words: Prejudice, stereotyping and discrimination. I will address them one by one. Prejudice: Definition: 'Preconceived opinion that is not based on reason or actual experience' http://www.oxforddictionaries.com... Does feminism advocate prejudice on the basis of sex? According to the definition of feminism, it does not; feminism advocates equal rights between men and women. Experience (as well as reason) as thought us that a society in which everyone possesses equal rights is better of than one where that isn't the case. Therefore, one can not say that feminism advocates prejudice on the basis of sex. Stereotype: Definition: 'A widely held but fixed and oversimplified image or idea of a particular type of person or thing' http://www.oxforddictionaries.com... Does feminism use stereotypes on the basis of sex? According to the definition of feminism, it does not; advocating equality between men and women is actually a good way to ELIMINATE stereotypes, which historically have been mostly directed at women (a few examples: http://www.businessinsider.com...). Therefore, one can not say that feminism is using stereotypes on the basis of sex. Discrimination: Definition: 'The unjust or prejudicial treatment of different categories of people, especially on the grounds of race, age, or sex' http://www.oxforddictionaries.com... Does feminism advocate the use of discrimination on the basis of sex? Again, according to the definition of feminism, it does not; feminism advocates equal rights is a good way to make sure that we live in a JUST system. Feminism actually seeks to eliminate the idea that men and women are 'different categories of people'. (I have already covered prejudice). Therefore, one can not say that feminism advocates the use of discrimination on the basis of sex. (My other arguments address what my opponent says in Round 2, so I will keep them for the rebuttal) Since feminism advocates neither prejudice nor stereotype nor discrimination, we can safely conclude that, according to the definitions of feminism and sexism, feminism is not sexist.
166	 I can now make a statement of a more formal sort, since my opponent has responded to the point about the BoP: "I would like to make the point that, according to the definition of feminism and the definition of sexism that were outlined in the opening of this debate, my opponent is claiming that feminism has a certain characteristic [in this case, sexist], which is in opposition to the definition. According to the definitions, feminism does not possess this characteristic. If my opponent believes that the definition should be different, that is a different debate altogether. Therefore, since feminism does not possess sexism according to the definition given, my opponent has failed to prove his point".
167	 Round 2 here ends because I have fulfilled my requirement of making my rebuttal in Round 1. Therefore, it is my opponent's turn to make a rebuttal. I do expect my opponent to provide at least a minimal rebuttal, though, since that is the courteous thing to do, and it would avoid my point that my opponent is supposed to restate its argument. However, if no such rebuttal is made, I will proceed by providing rebuttals to all the points that my opponent brought up. Rebuttals will be grouped by topic.
168	 Protecting from all sexism, including forms of sexism that didn't exist during the 1800s, often and what actually existed often gets confused with the obvious efforts to prevent sexism from what existed in the 1800s. Since even countering that is considered racist by some like white people who use "white feminist" as a codeword for someone who isn't going to help them with that racist lens based on race. Actually, like whites of female gender and others of less privilege get confused with the clearly expressed intentions to a more perfect union.
169	 Here is some text: Feminism has undergone a significant change over the past two centuries, as society's social structure has changed. Historically, feminism was a way to confront the subordinate position that women occupied in society. One of the main reasons for women's subordinate position was, and still is, their domestic duties that most often did not allow them to be exposed to a variety of professions. Eventually, feminism as a movement grew out of its historical roots and became more and more acceptable and diverse. As a result, feminism is no longer necessarily connected with a set of goals that advocate women's equal right to occupy any position they desire, nor is there an all-female movement anymore. As the modern day definition of feminism indicates, the main goals of feminism are equality of opportunity and equal rights, regardless of gender. I will call feminism of the past decade that based on this definition the "civil rights" feminism. The modern feminist movement is very different from the old one. The old feminist movement has been criticized for making extremist claims, like the notion that men are to blame for the oppression of women, that women's current situation was produced by men and would get better by taking away men's dominant role in society. However, as pointed out by many of my opponent's references, the feminist movement is often much more tolerant towards men than the individualists and conservatives. Instead of insisting that men should subjugate women and hand their power over, civil rights feminists often claim that feminism is about equality. In that sense, modern feminism is different from the old one. I will turn to my opponent's points now: The main problem he pointed out was the assumption that the fear of feminism stems from a latent patriarchy within feminism. First of all, this is a claim that is not very well justified and he himself later refutes. His only argument is the idea that men receive "a benefit of the doubt" by claiming to be feminists and getting away with it. This can be countered by the analysis of this very statement: "Making a point of a sexist joke in order to highlight the fact that you're a feminist says something about your priorities." Since the original sentence (including the gender marker) is subjective, arguing that "making a point of a sexist joke" is subjective too. Both feminists and conservatives believe that it is wrong to make a point of a sexist joke. Those who make a point of a sexist joke are trying to express a strong opinion regarding their own values, which would imply that their values are important to them. They would not want to be accused of being a sexist because they might be doing it consciously. Of course, the point of "highlighting the fact" is also subjective, but I don't see how the claim that feminism should be progressive can be refuted by this point (the claim that men receive a benefit of the doubt). The argument my opponent uses later can be refuted easily as well. He says that feminists are insisting on equality and ignoring inequality, which is obviously not a valid analysis of the situation. I should mention here that I believe that some feminists do have a personal agenda. Some women do want to have more power in society. They want to achieve equality and want to have the possibility of becoming powerful. However, those who want to, can decide to do so. Here is where my opponent talks about men-hating feminists. In an effort to refute the assumption that feminists hate men, he uses the example of one woman whose hate for men was heavily reinforced during her youth, as opposed to a number of other feminists that have a somewhat optimistic view about men. Using an exceptional case in order to discredit a normative statement is a fallacy. It is also important to clarify that the insistence on equality does not in any way mean that we are living in a gender-neutral society. On the contrary, feminism does believe in giving women a voice and offering women the opportunities that have always been available to men. As summarized above, feminism is about equal opportunities. The claim that women are the weaker gender is not a goal of feminism (as was the case in the past), but the assumption that women are "different from men" is not completely irrelevant. They are not independent of each other. My opponent's next argument (and it was actually his rebuttal's most solid one) is the reason why I don't believe that feminism is sexist. I agree with everything he says here, but I don't think it refutes the case that feminism is sexist. My opponent agrees that feminism defines itself as the advocacy of women's rights. That being said, my opponent says that "if you use the words advocating and equal rights to describe feminism, the term'sexist' is not in appropriate, especially since the name itself indicates that feminism seeks equality of rights." My opponent here makes a claim that if I say I am a woman advocating for women's rights, I am not being sexist. I would say that many people who identify themselves as feminists are not sexist. That being said, feminism as such IS sexist and sexism is a premise upon which modern feminism is based. When they say they "stand for women", they stand for women against men, they stand for women against men. What I tried to accomplish with this rebuttal was to show that feminism does not subscribe to the assumption that women are oppressed by men. However, the old feminism can be viewed as a struggle for women's equal rights in society and that was a valid reason for its existence. I stated earlier that civil rights feminism has been criticized by those who claim that feminism was not about equality. My opponent here tries to disprove this statement by arguing that modern feminists do not insist on a specific type of social equality, "according to
170	 We are still in Iraq and all my points were about feminism. If we are still in Iraq tomorrow I stand by everything I said. You confuse equal rights with feminism. Equal rights isn't a political movement in itself, whereas feminism is a political movement. Think of it this way; a black kid wants to be respected for being black but also wants to play and be friends with white kids. You have equal rights to black kids but that doesn't make you a black kid. This is why I'm not a proponent of feminism. In conclusion, I'm not saying we shouldn't help girls but you need to stop using your feminism card when you can't defend your positions. I disproved all of Con's arguments because they are all based on lies and made by people who have no idea what they are talking about. I still need to somehow explain how fighting for equal rights is not feminism but we'll worry about that later.
171	 First to answer the attack on Observation One: Pro's response to this was that we are not in Iraq. This piece of evidence was from 2010, and since then nothing has changed as we still have people supporting feminism. During the Iraq war, it was true that they were more likely to be raped than shot. If we were in Iraq today it would still stand. Next he said he was never talking about pornography, however it can be inferred from his opener. The reason a lot of men are attracted to pornography is because it shows dominant men over women. Also note that Con concurred that pro was pro feminism in the last round.

This means that feminism, by its very definition means equal rights to women. Pro admitted they are pro equal rights, so therefore, by the very definition of feminism, they are pro feminism. Additionally, note Observation 2 and Advantages 1 and 2 were untouched in the last round, which is reason alone to vote for con. In conclusion, by the definition of feminism, pro conceded that feminism is good, as well as not denying that feminism is bad by not attacking my advantages of feminism.

175	 First off, I did some searching, and the Marriam-Webster dictionary is made in liberal Massachusetts. They clearly bended the definition to serve their needs. I don't agree with that definition. You see, if a said a was a "masculinist", people would say that I'm male supremacist, but if I called myself a feminist, I would be called a "champion of rights". So, since "masculinism" is male supremacy, then feminism is female supremacy. I consider myself an "equalist". Feminism today is so twisted and hypocritical today, that it is best to abandon it. I am for the rights of men AND women, not JUST women, and not ONLY men.
