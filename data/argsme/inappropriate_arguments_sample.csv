climate change,"Global Warming (or climate change in the hot way) is the thing. It is a win or lose election debate topic. It is also very contested in the public field (media). The IPCC states that it exists and that it is human induced. State intervention is often motivated by climate change concerns. However there are many scientists, people and companies that contest climate change or human induced climate change. They have interesting arguments. I believe that they are mistaken. I define human global warming as the abnormal and significant increase of mean global temperatures caused (in part) by human activity. I expect to win if i can show that 1 climate change (in the sense of global warming) exists 2 it is caused in a significant degree by human activity I consider that my opponent wins if he/she is able to negate either of the above. I will affirm 3 arguments to sustain my position: science cvasi-consensus, observable events in the world around us, mental experiment. At this moment there is near consensus between scientists that global warming exists and is human induced[1]. The scientific model is quite simple to understand and makes sense. It is clear that the weather is influenced by many factors, and some are more powerful than others. The greenhouse effect is a powerful factor as shown by the super greenhouse effect on Venus. [2] Green house gases have increased at the highest level in the last 650 000 years after the industrial revolution. [3] To bring the scientific argument down to the human level and to avoid an authority argument i will point out that ice caps are already melting, the first drowned polar bears were found, more violent weather is happening etc. What is more, the arctic ice shows an increase in carbon concentration and temperature.[4] The mental experiment part is more complex in the sense that it involves the concept of positive feed-back. The oceans trap carbon while they are cold, when they heat up they release carbon. This a positive feed-back loop and it means that things will only get worse.[5] . Humans have reached a level where they can affect the climate. Acid rains and other city related weather are examples of humans influencing weather. In conclusion, from the scientific, factual and mental experiment arguments I conclude that global warming exists and it is human induced. Looking forward for a good debate.

climate change,"A study by the biology cabinet shows no relationship between CO2 and temperature [1]. ""On this assessment, the evidence points to a current natural climate change which happens sequentially in two main climate periods, icehouse and warmhouse."" Another study was found on the Vostok ice cores, which show temperature records going back over 400,000 years. Data from the ice cores reveal an 800 year lag of CO2 behind temperature [2], meaning CO2 changes came AFTER temperature. If climate change was man made, then temperature would lag behind CO2, but the opposite happens, which proves that CO2 cannot influence temperature. The ice cores also show that the temperature rose to about the same level whenever it rose significantly, which shows that it is a constant cycle and not affected by human activities. The same can be said about the CO2 levels. Manipulation and False Activism Pollutes the Climate Change Debate One of the biggest science scandals, Climategate, occurred in 2009. Hackers stole emails from scientists at the East Angelia Climatic Research Unit, and statements from the emails contradict anthropogenic climate change. [3]. ""The fact is that we can't account for the lack of warming at the moment and it is a travesty that we can't... Our observing system is inadequate"" [4]. ""I've just completed Mike's Nature trick of adding in the real temps to each series for the last 20 years (ie from 1981 onwards) and from 1961 for Keith's to hide the decline."" [4]. The government as well as a variety of foundations donate billions of dollars to scientists to prove global warming is man made and to groups that put a megaphone to the global warming agenda. [5] ""the U.S. Government spent more than $32.5 billion on climate studies between 1989 and 2009. This doesn't count about $79 billion more spent for related climate change technology research, foreign aid and tax breaks for green energy.""- Forbes A report by the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works shows a ""billionaire's club"" that directs funding to leftist environmental activism groups and policy makers, while also getting grants from the government. [5] ""Under President Obama, EPA has given more than $27 million in taxpayer-funded grants to major environmental groups. Notably, the Natural Resources Defense Council and Environmental Defense Fund "" two key activists groups with significant ties to senior EPA officials "" have collected more than $1 million in funding each."" Finally, Former Vice President Al Gore made a famous movie called ""An Inconvenient Truth"" about the theory of man made global warming and its effects. However, there were eleven significant errors in his movie, coming from Gore trying to exaggerate in attempt to scare people into believing his political agenda. So what could be the cause of the global warming? I believe the sun is the one responsible, as correlations between the sun and the Earth's temperature have been found when studying temperature and sun levels from 1880-1980 [11], and 1980-2006 [12]. This could also explain why other planets in our solar system are warming, as all the planets rely on the Sun. But at the end of the day, the warming is NOT caused by CO2.

[6] ""The fossil fuel industry risks losing $33 trillion in revenue over the next 25 years as global warming may drive companies to leave oil, natural gas and coal in the ground, according to a Barclays Plc energy analyst. Government regulations and other efforts to cut carbon emissions will inevitably slash demand for fossil fuels, jeopardizing traditional energy producers, Mark Lewis, Barclays’s head of European utilities equity research, said Monday during a panel discussion in New York on financial risks from climate change. His comments are part of a growing chorus calling for more transparency from oil and gas companies about how their balance sheets may be affected by the global shift away from fossil fuels. As governments adopt stricter environmental policies, there’s increasing risk that companies’ untapped deposits of oil, gas and coal may go unused, turning valuable reserves into stranded assets of questionable value. “There will be lower demand for fossil fuels in the future, and by definition that means lower prices” Lewis said.""

climate change,There is an overwhelming scientific consensus climate change presents a serious risk to the future of the Earth and to mankind. Many of the threats we face due to climate change are insidious and while with others the connection may not be noticed by the deniers. But they are real and serious.

climate change,"The theory that CO2 is the dominant cause of global warming is based upon computer models that were derived under errant assumptions. The models have completely failed to predict the observed changes in climate. If CO2 was a significant cause of global warming, and CO2 theorists were correct that nothing else is presently affecting climate, then the predictions should have inescapably fallen into line. Over a period when the earth was supposed to warm by 5 degrees, it actually cooled by 3 degrees. In the history of the earth, the climate has warmed and cooled with apparent complete independence of CO2 levels. There was an ice age when CO2 levels were twelve times higher than at present. In the period of the Holocene Optimum, about 3,000 to 5,000 years ago, temperatures were warmer than CO2 models predict the earth will become in the future, but there was no human-produced CO2 to be blamed. The Holocene optimum was a time of human prosperity, and the polar bears paddled through it quite nicely. I presented scientific references in support of every one of these claims. Pro has not rebutted a single one of these assertions. He completely ignored most of them. Instead he focused on (1) asserting that the existence of the IPCC report proves a consensus among scientists, and that a consensus established scientific fact. He also (2) impugned the integrity of scientists who did not accept CO2 theory, claiming that the had all been bought off by the oil companies. Finally, he argued (3) that the climate on Venus proved that CO2 was a significant determinant of climate on present day earth. The IPCC Report The IPCC Report exists, however there is no evidence that it represents a consensus among climate scientists, or, more importantly that it represents the overwhelming consensus that Pro claims. I claimed that the IPCC was a political organization with only 30% of the members being actual climate scientists, that the report conclusions were written by a small number of people who required authors of individual sections to support their conclusions, that report was not subject to peer review, and that the contributing scientists were not allowed to vote on the accuracy of the report. Pro did not rebut a single one my claims; he only claimed that those criticisms were inconclusive. I provided reference to the book by Michaels on the IPCC process, the statements of John Christy (a lead author of the IPCC report), and the statement of Landsea, the hurricane expert who resigned in protest when the IPCC central committee changed his conclusion that hurricane activity was unrelated to CO2. Pro provided no contrary evidence. Climate change was recently debated by William Schlesinger and John Christy, both qualified climate scientists. http://www.johnlocke.org... Schlesinger claimed the IPCC report showed the kind of consensus Pro also claimed. Christy told the audience that as a lead author he knew it was political. After the debate, a question from the audience asked Schlesinger what percentage of the IPCC was composed of climate scientists. Schlesinger replied that there were many aspects to the science and that he didn't know for sure, but that ""perhaps 20% had something to do with climate."" This from a strong proponent of the theory. (Debate fans might find the whole debate worth watching. I think Christy won handily, and so did the audience.) The Integrity of Dissent Pro made the claim that the oil industry sponsored most of the research contradicting CO2 theory. I pointed out that NASA alone poured more that a hundred times Exxon's measly $1.6 million in the quest to prove CO2 theory. Counting all the sponsorship on both sides, the weight of sponsorship is undoubtedly many hundreds of times in favor of supporting CO2 theory. So I asked how it could be that opponents were easily corrupted, while proponents were immune. Pro did not respond beyond the implication that oil companies were evil. Beyond that I challenged Pro to explain how the peer review process for scientific journals allowed what Pro claimed to be bogus research to be published. Pro ignored my challenge and failed to provide any explanation as to how the peer review process was somehow corrupted. I think that scientists are subject to group think like others in society, but that the peer review process is fundamentally honest. Dissenting papers are published because they present data and analysis that stands up to scrutiny. Pro has no explanation that supports his theory of bogus science. The peer review process means that it makes no difference who sponsors research, the results stand on their own. Is Earth Like Venus? Pro originated the discussion of Venus, claiming that the temperature on Venus proved Earth's climate was sensitive to small changes in CO2 levels. I pointed out that 3500 times as much CO2 only produced a 150 degree rise, so it certainly didn't prove climate was sensitive to CO2. Pro responded that even though it wasn't sensitive overall, it might be sensitive at low levels. Yes, it might be, but is it? I presented a scientific paper that provided the physical basis for CO2 effects on earth, and then fit the actual data from the 20th century to the curve shape. The result showed that doubling CO2 on earth would produce less than a two degree temperature rise. In the detailed analysis, the curve on Venus would be different because (1) unlike Venus the dominant greenhouse gas on earth is water vapor, and (2) the atmosphere on Venus is about 100 times as dense. One might expect Pro to respond with a scientific paper on the CO2 theory as applied to earth's atmosphere that derives a different result. He did not. Pro simply asserted he was correct. I have looked for such a paper and never found one either. This is consistent with my assertion that CO2 theory does not derive from any simple physical theory, but rather from tweaking multiplier coefficients in computer models. I also referenced climate scientists (Spencer et al) that tweaking is how CO2 theory is derived. Throughout the debate, Pro referenced dubious Wikipedia articles, blog posts, and popular press articles instead of articles written by climate scientists. I challenged Pro several time to reference scientists and to point out exactly where in his references I could find support for his claims. He did not respond to any challenge. --- Pro's asserts CO2 is ""significant"" if it justifies enacting cap and trade legislation. Since past warm periods like the Medieval Warm Period and the much warmer Holocene Optimum were prosperous times for humanity, by that criteria the resolution fails even if CO2 causes global warming in the amounts postulated by the latest IPCC report. Besides, cap and trade does not lower CO2 levels, so it is never justified. I would allow a lesser criteria for ""significant,"" perhaps if half of global warming were due to CO2. If it were only half, that would be a devastating blow to the theory, since advocates claim there is no other source of climate change at present. If one looks at the observed climate data, it is unlikely that more than 10 percent is due to CO2. CO2 is increasing slowly and smoothly, but world temperatures are moving largely independently, with the last decade showing if anything a slight downward trend. If CO2 were to account for as much as half of climate change, the past decade would have shown a significant increase. The irradiance (heat output) of the sun also fails to explain climate change. Right now the best bet is that it changes in the sun's magnetosphere that drives climate. That tracks well with past and present climate. The Little Ice Age, for example, corresponded to a period of no sunspots. However, if that is not the significant factor in climate, then something unknown other than CO2, is. The resolution is negated.",CON,This from a strong proponent of the theory. ... The resolution is negated.,10
climate change,"The first most obvious mistake my opponent made in their argument was a cherry-picking fallacy. A cherry-picking fallacy is defined as ""When only select evidence is presented in order to persuade the audience to accept a position, and evidence that would go against the position is withheld. The stronger the withheld evidence, the more fallacious the argument."" [8] As you can see, my opponent, in round 2, only offered evidence which suggests anthropogenic climate change is real, and did not offer any evidence that suggests climate change is due to some other reason. A scientific consensus exists on the reality of anthropogenic climate change. -Stupidape This argument is fallacious because it doesn't take into account direct evidence, and only is about the opinions of climate scientists, who are not infallible. I already pointed this out in my main arguments, but that wasn't meant to be a direct response to my opponent, but a rebuttal on the general claim. In addition, there is room for doubt as long as there is not 100% of climate scientists who agree on this matter, which is not the case. ""Man-made climate change has already claimed human lives and continues to do so..."" -Stupidape This appears to be a Non Sequitur fallacy. This is ""when the conclusion does not follow from the premises. In more informal reasoning, it can be when what is presented as evidence or reason is irrelevant or adds very little to support to the conclusion."" [9] The amount of deaths happened from a heat wave in France. Sudden hot weather in one country doesn't prove that there is global climate change, let alone that it is anthropogenic. In addition, the heat-related deaths in the United States since 2000 has been going down[10], which is odd if supposedly there is significant amounts of warming. But yes, if you look at the graph provided by the EPA there, each of the three spikes in deaths, one in 2000, one soon after 2005, and one soon after 2010, are each going down over time. If you were to draw a straight line representing the average, it would also be going down.

The earth has been warming at the rate of about 0.19 deg/decade since the end of the Little Ice Age in the early 1800s, well before human-produced CO2 could have been the cause. Climate change is the norm. The prior Medieval Warm Period, when Greenland was declared green, was about as warm as the present. Before that, the Holocene Optimum, about 3-5000 years ago was not only warmer than now, it was warmer than the dire global warming predictions forecast. [2a] Polar bears survived. I deny the contention that human-produced CO2 is a significant factor, although I allow that it may be a marginal contributor. The alleged scientific consensus is not meaningful, because the the consensus is largely determined by non-scientists and by scientists whose expertise is outside of fields relevant to climatology. The IPCC conclusions are determined by a dozen or so political zealots who write the conclusions and then force the scientists in charge of individual chapters to rewrite to support the conclusion the elite has reached. Only about 30% of the IPCC are scientists, the rest are government bureaucrats. The IPCC report is not subject to peer review and the scientists who contribute are not allowed to vote on whether it is reflects the consensus view or not. http://nzclimatescience.net... http://thewashingtonpest.blogspot.com... The professional societies operate in much the same fashion. The AAAS has only a few climate scientists, and the endorsement of climate change is done by the political elite, not by the climate scientists. Not too many years ago, the consensus of relevant mental health professionals was that homosexuality was a form of mental illness, and the learned societies officially endorsed that view. It was wrong. Similarly, the Steady State Theory of the universe was once the strong consensus view; that consensus didn't last. Recently, DOE Secretary Stephen Chu was asked by a Democrat if it was possible if global warming could possibly be ""a hoax."" Of course it isn't a hoax, because the people who believe in it are sincere. Chu himself endorses CO2 theory. Nonetheless, Chu was properly circumspect. He said (paraphrasing), ""In science we most honor the dissenters who disprove the consensus."" The highly publicized consensus in 1970 was that the earth was on the brink of a new ice age. The best estimates of the level of consensus I've seen are from Patrick Michaels, who worked on the IPCC reports, which can be combined with limited polling data. it's probably about 40% pro-CO2, 30% anti, and the rest ""maybe."" CO2 is a greenhouse gas, as Pro supposes. So if CO2 increases, say, 10%, then we ought to get something like 10% warming, right? No, that is not the way it works. A little bit of the CO2 in the atmosphere causes a relatively large amount of global warming, but as more is added the relative effect decreases dramatically. A straightforward physical model of the CO2 in the atmosphere shows that the increases in CO2 in the twentieth century would have a negligible direct effect on climate. To make the increases in CO2 have a significant effect, there has to be a multiplier that somehow magnifies the effect. There are many candidates for such a multiplier. For example, if somehow average cloud cover where reduced by a mere 2%, we would expect as much global warming as has been observed. It's no problem for guys with computers and hundreds of variables to tweak them to make the answer come out any way they want it to. The test as to whether they have it right is whether the models accurately predict what is observed. They do not. http://www.drroyspencer.com... There was a spike in temperatures in the mid to late 1990's. The models predicted a continual exponential rise in temperature. El Nino went away and temperatures subsided. Temperatures for the past decade have been about stable. If anything, they have decreased. http://www.drroyspencer.com... Atmospheric particulates were modeled to cause temperatures to decrease from 1930 to 1970, but that is no longer available to explain why temperatures are not increasing. Perhaps most telling, CO2 theory makes a strong prediction about the relative temperature rise in the lower, middle, and upper atmosphere and from pole to pole. The observations show the predictions to be wrong. [1a] Past climate change was probably due to solar activity, because there was insignificant human-produced CO2. Observations of the last few hundred years show solar effects correlate well with climate change. Unfortunately, solar activity turns out to need a multiplier just like CO2 theory. One explanation is that cosmic rays cause increased cloud formation, and the small changes in cloud formation produce the climate effects. This theory is not established, but there is a major test being conducted by CERN. Pro points to a feedback effect from CO2 being released from the ocean as the ocean is heated. This puts more CO2 in the air, which in turn causes more heating. The regenerative effect is such that once global warming starts, the world is guaranteed to end. But actually, there have been many instances of warming greater than the present, and the world did not end. The climate reversed and became colder despite the high CO2 levels. That means that whatever the contribution of CO2 to warming, there was something far greater that controlled climate, driving temperatures down despite CO2's best efforts to keep them up. The likely culprit is the Sun dominating climate. CO2 levels lag the rise and fall of temperatures by about 800 years. That implies that if multiplying effects of CO2 were significant, the earth could not have had temperature significant temperature changes in less than 800 years. Think in terms of an auto that has a 80 second lag in the accelerator. You floor the accelerator, and 80 seconds later you are up to 25 mph. With that kind of car, it isn't possible to get to 50 in just a few seconds. However, there are instances of dramatic climate change in around 50 years. The theory is therefore wrong. The Arctic Ice cap appears and disappears in roughly 60 year cycles. http://www.drroyspencer.com... The 60 year cycles track solar activity. Ships sailed across the Arctic Ocean in 1939, the last time the ice disappeared. Last winter was one of the coldest Arctic winters on record, with about a third of the ice refreezing. It appears the cycle has peaked and it heading colder. There is no sound evidence that weather is getting more violent due to global warming. [1c] In the last IPCC report, the executive committee demanded that the scientist in charge of the section on hurricanes attribute increase in hurricane activity to global warming. He refused and resigned in protest. http://sciencepolicy.colorado.edu... The scientific evidence now points to solar activity as the cause of present global warming as well as past global warming. There are multiple solar effects, including direct solar irradiance, cosmic ray effect induced by changes in the Sun's magnetosphere, and long term variations in the earth tilt and orbit. There are seven or more solar cycles that correlate well with past and present climate change. CO2 theory claims that CO2 now dominates climate, but in fact temperatures have been stable for a decade despite CO2 rise. 1. Michaels, P. J., Shattered Consensus (a) p246-51 2.

climate change,"Acknowledgement of opposing evidence I shall first bring up some evidence in favor of anthropogenic climate change. One may wonder why I would do this when I am arguing against anthropogenic climate change, but it’s really simple: I do this in order to provide the opposing side some representation and then I will present my side to refute that side’s argument. That is the most logical way of debating, and if you ignore evidence when it is available to you, that is a cherry-picking fallacy. The main evidence of anthropogenic climate change, is the increased levels of CO2 emissions within the past couple of centuries. It is believed that irreversible effects are occurring now and into the future due to increased CO2 emissions, and that this CO2 emission increase is due to primarily human activity [1]. In fact, in this study, it is shown that if humans were to cut all CO2 emissions the CO2 in the atmosphere would linger still and still cause more warming even if it were all put to an end. [1] There are of course plenty of other studies that show this as well. Refuting the scientific consensus There is often stated that 97% of climate scientists agree that anthropogenic climate change is real[2]. However, it is a fallacy to trust the words of authorities on the matter without considering the evidence. In a study conducted by John Cook et al, the same source that my opponent has cited, it was found that majority(66.7%) of studies in relation to anthropogenic climate change were either neutral or inconclusive.[3] One must wonder why 97% of climate scientists are of the opinion anthropogenic climate change is real when the majority of evidence out there is inconclusive and there is some scientific evidence(.7% of studies out there) that anthropogenic climate change is not real, which I shall point out later. In science, something needs to be tested over and over again and achieve the same results in order to conclude something off of it. The fact that U32; of anthropogenic climate change studies come up with inconclusive or neutral results indicates that we actually don’t understand the effects humans have on climate change, and the scientists are assuming we do by taking the 32% of times that it proved anthropogenic climate change as fact, when majority of the time there is no conclusion to be made. Therefore, 97% of climate scientists, are, in fact, acting unscientifically in this case. Reiterating previous debate points In a previous debate with the same user, it was established that 3.225% of all CO2 emissions are caused from humans by unnatural causes. [4] In addition, the global temperature for over the past 136 years has only gone up by about 1 degree fahrenheit[1]. These two facts suggest that if humans have had impact on the climate, it is hardly anything to be worried about at all. Problems with CO2 emissions claims Since there may be an increase in natural CO2 emissions, it is hard to conclude that the CO2 emissions by humans is what is causing the warming specifically. All variables need to be taken into account, which the study in my second paragraph under “Acknowledging opposing evidence” that claims anthropogenic climate change happens from CO2 emissions by humans, doesn’t take into account the natural CO2 emissions, the activity of the sun, or anything else that could be leading to warming of the earth. In addition, it has been found in one study by Willie Soon et al, that CO2 emissions rising often follows temperature rise, and not always the other way around [5]. If it was as simple as CO2 rises, and therefore temperature rises due to it, then the reverse should not be happening where temperature rises and then CO2 rises. It was also found that CO2 forcing effects on seasonal temperature to be inconclusive, particularly since CO2 emissions cause warming at first, but the warming causes more evaporation of water and thus more clouds and humidity, which lead to a cooling effect, the net effect is not much change in the overall temperature [5] Next, another study performed by G. V Chilingar et al found that “Even significant releases of the anthropogenic carbon dioxide into the atmosphere do not change average parameters of the Earth’s heat regime and the atmospheric greenhouse effect. Moreover, CO2 concentration increase in the atmosphere results in rising agricultural productivity and improves the conditions for reforestation. Thus, accumulation of small additional amounts of carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere as a result of anthropogenic activities has practically no effect on the Earth’s climate.” In another comprehensive study on global temperature rises by Patrick J. Michaels et al, it was concluded from “observations of atmospheric CO2 buildup and global CO2 emissions... that lead to exponential warming... is not based upon the reality of recent decades.” Many of the models scientists have come out with to show that CO2 rises cause exponential warming, are not reflective of what has actually been happening in the world, and the warming in the world is much more linear. Problems in general with anthropogenic climate change While I could continue to talk about all of the evidence against anthropogenic climate change, I shall instead provide a link to over 90 peer-reviewed scientific articles that show problems with anthropogenic climate change; there are many and various problems with it ranging from how CO2 doesn’t actually affect temperature in the long-term since it balances out when water is evaporated by the initial warming, to problems with climate models, to what should have been expected to result from anthropogenic climate change not actually happening. [7] Due to all of these issues listed above in this category and the previous 3, it is difficult to believe the climate scientists who claim anthropogenic climate change is a reality, when, as far as I’m aware, they have not addressed the above issues outlined. Inconclusive results and the default position Because as mentioned before, that majority of the studies done into anthropogenic climate change resulted in inconclusive or neutral results, the default position should be that anthropogenic climate change does not exist. Just as believing a god doesn’t exist is the default position when there is not conclusive evidence for or against a god, or majority of the evidence is inconclusive or neutral, so would then the position on anthropogenic climate change have the default position of not believing in it.

climate change,"While what you state is true, this is a red herring. As seen from your same source, the consensuses holds. ""4. Discussion Of note is the large proportion of abstracts that state no position on AGW. This result is expected in consensus situ- ations where scientists â€˜ . . . generally focus their discussions on questions that are still disputed or unanswered rather than on matters about which everyone agrees â€™ (Oreskes 2007, p 72)."" [6] -stupidape However, not about everyone does agree with this. Several problems were found with each of the studies that declared 97% of climate scientists agree that anthropogenic climate change occurs. For example, one such study was found to have only included 5% of respondents as climate scientists[11]. Then the very same study we are looking at above, used only the evidence that takes a position on anthropogenic climate change(for or against) and declared that 97% of climate scientists agree on it, when actually, that's only 97% of climate scientists who take a position, and doesn't take into account that some may believe it is inconclusive. It was found, in fact, that about 15% of climate scientists, when asked to rank 1-7 where 1 is not convinced at all, and 7 is very much convinced that anthropogenic climate change is occuring, ranked from 1-4. Which is a significant amount of scientists who doubt it or are unsure(where 4 would be unsure).[12] Just because majority of climate scientists agree, doesn't mean we can just immediately dismiss the evidence and opinions that suggest climate change is not real. ""False, as shown above, the 97% censuses is true. "" -stupidape Well, as shown above, it's actually 85% who believe somewhat or more in anthropogenic climate change, and only 34.59% are absolutely sure[12] which means, technically, a majority have some doubts lingering in their minds otherwise they would have ranked it as 7. .6 degrees Celsius to be exact. That is significant considering the rate of change. Ego systems do not have the ability to adjust to such rapid change. Also, the majority of the temperature change is happening in the last few decades. [7] As for the Co2, being a small amount this is another red herring. Due to positive feedback cycles the amount is increased dramatically. You can see that in the previous debate. Finally, natural Co2 is cycled naturally, unnatural Co2 accumulates as a greenhouse gas. [12] -Stupidape There are a number of problems with global climate models(GCM's) though, which is what this claim that the earth is warming is based off of. There is the general coldness problem, which indicates that the real temperature is actually colder than what the GCM's indicate. [13] Since we don't have a completely reliable way of measuring the global temperature, it can't be concluded that there even is warming. ""Natural Co2 emissions counterbalance themselves, [12] sun activity is at a low. [13] Other variables have been accounted for. [10]"" -Stupidape However, it's been proven that the Earth's position in orbit and rotational axis is changing, to the point where it's getting slightly closer to the sun. This also would result in warming, which is not mentioned at all in the tenth article you linked, so it hasn't been accounted for. [13] ""Compared to the thousands of peer reviewed scientific articles that do support climate change."" -stupidape There are likely more studies than just those 90, I doubt skeptical science put up every single study that goes against anthropogenic climate change. Also, just because there is a smaller amount of studies, doesn't mean they can somehow be dismissed as easily as you have. You need to analyze them and compare them to the studies claiming anthropogenic climate change is real. Then you determine which ones have the more valid claims. Since you have not done this, most likely, it is too soon to claim anthropogenic climate change is real, thus there is room for doubt. ""As for the incorect climate models, only one model can be correct. Therefore the majority will be incorrect. It would be a waste to make redunant correct models."" -stupidape This doesn't provide anything substantive since you didn't claim to know which one is correct, so again, how do we know the entire globe is even warming if we aren't sure we have the correct climage model?

climate change,"The theory that CO2 drives climate rose to prominence in the 1980s. The earth had been cooling from the 30s into the 70s, and by the early 70s the threat of an approaching ice age was the consensus of scientists and was hyped in the press. CO2 theory was derived by tweaking computer models under the assumption that the sun was inactive, and climate was being driven by CO2. The models predicted that the earth would be, by last summer, eight degrees warmer than was actually observed. The models also fail to predict the distribution of temperatures from the surface upwards, and fail to predict the distribution from pole to pole. CO2 has continued to rise, but temperatures over the last decade have been stable or slightly declining. In the history of the earth, there have been ice ages when there was 12 times as much CO2 in the atmosphere; it has never dominated climate. It's possible that CO2 makes a small contribution to climate cahnge, but clearly it's not the significant factor. If it were a key component, the CO2 models would have been proved right, rather than proved wrong. The magnetosphere of the sun has probably been driving climate change. CO2 theorists take the irradiance of the sun into account, but not the magnetosphere. Basically, solar magnetic activity moderates cosmic rays on earth, and the cosmic rays cause a cloud seeding effect which in turn affects cloud cover by the roughly 3% required to dominate climate. Historically, we know that a period of the Little Ice Age was characterize by there being virtually no sunspots. Cosmic ray theory is still unproved, but what is clear at this point is that something other than CO2 is in control of climate. The allegation is that Exxon-Mobile provides about $1.6 million per year to support non-CO2 research on global warming. Perhaps 40% of climate scientists dissent from CO2 theory, so Pro supposes that 40% of climate scientists can be bought for $1.6 million. In the current year, the US Congress alone ""has provided over $2,000,000,000 in resources to address the reality of global warming climate change and its effect on Earth's environments, ... [including] $400,000,000 for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, of which more than $200,000,000 is to enhance climate change research and regional assessments"" http://www.climatesciencewatch.org.... This does not count the money poured in by private foundations and foreign governments. Al Gore alone has made $100 million from global warming advocacy, with his unscientific movie winning him a Nobel Prize and an Oscar. An example of Gores ""science"" is that the IPCC says the worst case rise in sea level in the next hundred years is half a meter, but Gore shows New York being inundated. Gore regularly testifies before Congress in the role of an expert on global warming. In a BBC documentary, a researcher in the UK put it this way (paraphrasing): ""If I apply for a government research grant to study, 'The food storage habits of squirrels in Sussex' I'll have a small chance of getting funding. But if I propose to study, 'The effects of global warming on the food storage habits of squirrels in Sussex,' my chances are much improved."" http://www.amazon.com... Horner describes the outrageous bias shown in favor of CO2 theory and against opponents in his book: Red Hot Lies: How Global Warming Alarmists Use Threats, Fraud, and Deception to Keep You Misinformed So Pro is contending that Exxon's measly $1.6 million completely invalidates any opposition research, but the billions paid in tribute to CO2 theory simply do not count. If anything, it validates the opposition as willing to carry on based upon dedication to science despite inadequate funding. In science, there is the peer review process by which publications are reviewed by fellow scientists. The peer review committees are likely to have majorities favoring CO2 theory. So how is it that opposing papers, which Pro dismisses as worthless because of their sponsorship, get past peer review? There is no question that hundreds of such papers are published; hundreds are listed on the co2science.org web site. My explanation is that most scientists are fundamentally honest, and most papers don't make global pronouncements, they chip away at parts of the problem. The peer review process isn't perfect, but it works well enough to filter out bogus papers. So how does Pro's theory of scientists being easily corrupted by small money ($1.6 million spread among thousands of scientists) explain the opposition papers passing peer review? Pro originally claimed that high temperatures on Venus proved that climate was sensitive to small changes in CO2. The fact is that 3500 times the CO2 produces 150 degrees of warming, so clearly it is insensitive. Pro then introduced an imaginary unlabeled curve to show that even though it was insensitive overall, it could be sensitive at our present low levels. That's a different argument. It could be, but is it? Pro offered nothing but an imaginary curve. I then referenced the curve shape computed from physical theory fitted to the data from the 20th century, showing that doubling the CO2 levels on earth would raise temperatures here by less than 2 degrees. Pro then responded that the curve does not work for Venus. True, it doesn't work for Venus. One reason is that CO2 is not the dominant greenhouse gas on earth, but it is the dominant greenhouse gas on Venus. On earth it is water vapor. A second reason is that the atmosphere on Venus is nearly a hundred times as dense as that of earth, and most of the greenhouse effect occurs relatively near the surface. This was explained in detail in the references I gave. This makes the calculation for Venus considerably different that from that for earth. Pro has not rebutted the calculations done for earth under the assumptions appropriate for earth, where water vapor dominates, the atmosphere is relatively thin, and we have actual data for the 20th century. Pro claims, ""Con stated that temperatures have been stable for the past decade. I have proven this wrong and Con did not respond to this statement and the proof presented."" I did in fact respond to Pro's claim. I pointed out that Pro's claimed reference did not show the temperatures for the past decade. I then provided a reference that does show the temperatures, and clearly the temperatures have not been increasing as Pro claims. My exact words were, ""The second graph in http://wattsupwiththat.com... compares actual temperature with climate model prediction. Temperature have been level for the past decade, and August 2008 was 3 C below June 1988, rather than projected 5 C above."" Pro claims that I cannot logically attack both the existence of large consensus and the validity of the consensus. There is nothing illogical about attacking both. How many scientists believe something and whether it is correct or not are loosely coupled. Consensus on the shape of the earth or the 99.86% consensus on the theory of evolution are pretty convincing, but a 60/40 or 50/50 split is not a basis for claiming a reliable conclusion. CO2 theory has been taking severe hits as it continually fails to predict climate, and I'm not sure even if there is a consensus any more. Pro's only argument that there is a consensus is that the IPCC report exists. even though the IPCC is 70% non-scientists, the conclusions are dictated by a small elite, there is no peer review of the report, and scientists don't get to vote on it. The evidence is that CO2 is not a significant factor in recent climate change, and the variations in past climate cannot be attributed to CO2.

climate change,"But there is a scientific consensus on the reality of anthropogenic climate change. Climate scientists have repeatedly tried to make this clear. It is time for the rest of us to listen"" -Stupidape This argument that a consensus proves anything is preposterous, for a multitude of reasons. Number one, the consensus cited. This consensus reviewed 928 abstracts published in scientific journals. 928 is a somewhat large number, but not large enough to make a point off of, considering that there are hundreds of thousands of scientists in this field in the U.S alone [1]. Number two, consensuses are not reliable arguments, especially in the world of science. Scientists had consensuses on many things that turned out to be wrong, such as that saccharin led to cancer, and that the Sun's energy was a requirement for life. This consensus on climate change could be wrong as well. ""Man-made climate change has already claimed human lives and continues to do so."" - Stupidape Yes, weather related deaths are happening. And they are declining. According to an article by a Department of the Interior Science and Technology policy analyst Indur M. Goklany, global death rates from weather-related disasters are declining [2]. ""Death rates for the different categories of extreme events were generally lower in the 1990s and early to mid-2000s than in previous decades."". ""The World Health Organisation estimates that the warming and precipitation trends due to anthropogenic climate change of the past 30 years already claim over 150,000 lives annually. Many prevalent human diseases are linked to climate fluctuations, from cardiovascular mortality and respiratory illnesses due to heatwaves, to altered the transmission of infectious diseases and malnutrition from crop failures.""- Stupidape In the report I just showed about death rates from weather-related disasters, Indur M. Goklany goes into that exact study, and debunks it, saying that, ""Notably, the contribution of extreme events to the mortality burden for accidental causes of death is also small (at 0.4 percent)."" Saying that we need to double down on climate change because it is .4% of the reason for accidental deaths (Not even a full percentage) is quite ridiculous. Goklany also says that, ""Although the review paper""s estimates for non-flood related deaths are problematic, if one accepts them as valid, that means that climate change currently accounts for less than 0.3 percent of all global deaths. Accordingly, based on current contributions to the global mortality burden, other public health issues outrank climate change."" This furthers the point that cracking down on global warming for something so small is preposterous. But even putting the argument aside, it doesn't even fit in with what is supposed to be debated. ""I will contend that anthropogenic climate change exists. The contender will contend that anthropogenic climate change is non-existent.""-Stupidape Arguing that ""anthropogenic climate change"" is to blame for weather-related deaths doesn't prove it exists; it is simply an effect. An effect that wasn't supposed to be debated in the first place. ""The consensus that humans are causing recent global warming is shared by 90%""100% of publishing climate scientists according to six independent studies by co-authors of this paper. Those results are consistent with the 97% consensus reported by Cook et al.""- Stupidape The consensus cited is one example of how scientists manipulate data to push an agenda. Cook reviewed 11,914 abstracts, but only used 4,014 in his sample size because they expressed an opinion on global warming [3]. And from there, he got his 97% consensus, which is cherry picking, since he excluded the papers that did not give an opinion. But even THIS subset can't be relied on, as Former Director of the Center for Climatic Research at the University of Georgia and professor at the university Dr. David Legates and his colleagues reviewed Cook's consensus. Legates and his team found that, ""Only 41 out of the 11,944 published climate papers Cook examined explicitly stated that Man caused most of the warming since 1950. Cook himself had flagged just 64 papers as explicitly supporting that consensus, but 23 of the 64 had not, in fact, supported it."" [4]. Popular Technology reached out to scientists whose articles were in Cook's consensus. They said their papers were falsely classified or not included if they didn't endorse man-made climate change. ""[Interviewer] Dr. Carlin, your paper A Multidisciplinary, Science-Based Approach to the Economics of Climate Change is categorized by Cook et al. (2013) as; 'Explicitly endorses AGW but does not quantify or minimize'. Is this an accurate representation of your paper? Carlin: No, if Cook et al's paper classifies my paper, A Multidisciplinary, Science-Based Approach to the Economics of Climate Change' as ""explicitly endorses AGW but does not quantify or minimize,"" nothing could be further from either my intent or the contents of my paper.

The paper is strongly against AGW, and documents its absence in the sea level observational facts. Also, it invalidates the mode of sea level handling by the IPCC."" ""The fossil fuel industry risks losing $33 trillion in revenue over the next 25 years as global warming may drive companies to leave oil, natural gas and coal in the ground, according to a Barclays Plc energy analyst.""- Stupidape Yes, because of the regulations being put on the fossil fuel industry by the government in an attempt to stop something that is naturally occurring. So this isn't a fault of the industry- it's the government that's implementing the regulations that would drive the industry to the ground. Like the article itself said, ""Government regulations and other efforts to cut carbon emissions will inevitably slash demand for fossil fuels, jeopardizing traditional energy producers, Mark Lewis, Barclays""s head of European utilities equity research, said Monday during a panel discussion in New York on financial risks from climate change."" Again, this has NOTHING to do with what is supposed to be discussed. It doesn't prove that global warming is man made, so it shouldn't have been brought up in the first place. ""The Koch Brothers have sent at least $88,810,770 directly to 80 groups denying climate change science since 1997. One of the world""s most prominent climate researchers publishing scientific papers that doubt humanity""s role in climate change has received at least $1.2 million from the fossil fuel industry to fund his research and salary, according to documents revealed this weekend.""- Stupidape. First off, it is unknown if the Koch Brothers' donations led to any biases in research. As for the scientist who is claimed to be biased, his research is supported by data looking at the sun activity and temperature over the last 100 years [6], like I presented in my Round 2 argument. And if you're bringing up funding biases, you might as well bring up the fact that the government participates in the same thing. ""The US government has provided over $79 billion since 1989 on policies related to climate change, including science and technology research, foreign aid, and tax breaks."" [7]. ""Right now, we have an energy policy that is rigged to boost the profits of big oil companies like Exxon, BP, and Shell at the expense of average Americans. CEO""s are raking in record profits while climate change ravages our planet and our people "" all because the wealthiest industry in the history of our planet has bribed politicians into complacency in the face of climate change."" - Stupidape Our energy policy is not rigged to help the oil industries.

climate change,"Round four defense ""The first most obvious mistake my opponent made in their argument was a cherry-picking fallacy. A cherry-picking fallacy is defined as ""When only select evidence is presented in order to persuade the audience to accept a position, and evidence that would go against the position is withheld. The stronger the withheld evidence, the more fallacious the argument."" [8] As you can see, my opponent, in round 2, only offered evidence which suggests anthropogenic climate change is real, and did not offer any evidence that suggests climate change is due to some other reason. "" Capitalistslave First, there would have to be counter evidence to withhold. I do not perceive that I withheld any evidence, any my opponent has not shown any counter evidence. My opponent has failed to meet his/her burden of proof by showing that there is evidence to withhold. Second, if any evidence is withheld it is weak, thus the fallacious of the argument is small. Third, there is the fallacy fallacy. ""Form: Argument A for the conclusion C is fallacious. Therefore, C is false. Exposition: Like anything else, the concept of logical fallacy can be misunderstood and misused, and can even become a source of fallacious reasoning. To say that an argument is fallacious is, among other things, to claim that there is not a sufficiently strong logical connection between the premisses and the conclusion. This says nothing about the truth or falsity of the conclusion, so it is unwarranted to conclude that it's false simply because some argument for it is fallacious. "" [15] Even if I did withhold strong evidence, it doesn't mean Anthropogenic climate change is false, all it means is my argument is fallacious. ""A scientific consensus exists on the reality of anthropogenic climate change. -Stupidape This argument is fallacious because it doesn't take into account direct evidence, and only is about the opinions of climate scientists, who are not infallible. I already pointed this out in my main arguments, but that wasn't meant to be a direct response to my opponent, but a rebuttal on the general claim. In addition, there is room for doubt as long as there is not 100% of climate scientists who agree on this matter, which is not the case."" Capitalistslave True, climate change scientists are not infallible, but considering the scientific scholarly peer reviewed sources, the percentage of climate change scientist who support versus opposing man-made climate change, and the burden of proof is to be shared equally, I have more than met my burden of proof for showing the existence of man-made climate change. An alternative explanation is the USA court system. We do not require 100% proof to convict someone, instead we require a reasonable doubt in criminal cases, and preponderance of the evidence in civil. I have shown in my round two argument that we can believe beyond a reasonable doubt that man-made climate change exists. Finally, considering the scope of the entire world and global climate change, any direct evidence can be considered non-sequitur because it would add too little to support the claim. I would literally have to type 30,000 some characters to provide enough direct evidence to prove anthropgenic climate change. """"Man-made climate change has already claimed human lives and continues to do so..."" -Stupidape This appears to be a Non Sequitur fallacy. This is ""when the conclusion does not follow from the premises. In more informal reasoning, it can be when what is presented as evidence or reason is irrelevant or adds very little to support to the conclusion."" [9] The amount of deaths happened from a heat wave in France. Sudden hot weather in one country doesn't prove that there is global climate change, let alone that it is anthropogenic."" Capitalistslave The evidence may add very little and could qualify as non-sequitur. Yet, remember the fallacy fallacy. [15] More importantly, the scope of the entire planet is very large, so practically any argument I make giving specific examples could qualify as the last part of the non-sequitur fallacy. ""adds very little to support to the conclusion."" For example, the glaciers melting are just one small part of the entire world's ecosystem. Therefore, this could be considered a non-sequitur fallacy. Yet, evidence is cumulative. Individually the glaciers melting and the heatwaves might be non-sequitur, but together with a several more events and these would be significant enough to no longer qualify as non-sequitur and instead be a fully functional argument. Think of a bunch of straws in a haystack. Each straw could be considered non-sequitur taken individually, yet enough straws form a haystack. A person wouldn't dismiss the entire haystack as non-sequitur just because each individual straw adds little evidence for the conclusion, the existence of a haystack. Just as a person shouldn't dismiss small evidence that supports the conclusion, as long as there enough other straws to make a full argument. Now if my entire argument was just the heat waves, yes this would be non-sequitur, but considering the other evidence available that accumulates with the heat-waves, the heat waves cannot be dismissed. ""In addition, the heat-related deaths in the United States since 2000 has been going down[10], which is odd if supposedly there is significant amounts of warming. But yes, if you look at the graph provided by the EPA there, each of the three spikes in deaths, one in 2000, one soon after 2005, and one soon after 2010, are each going down over time. If you were to draw a straight line representing the average, it would also be going down. "" Captalistslave There is many alternative explanations for this. One is that awareness of global climate change has increased, and thus governments and their people are more prepared to deal with such events. Another, is that technology has increased and therefore weather stations are better able to warn residents of the danger. ""This is still a non sequitur for the same reasons I said before for the other one. Claiming deaths are a result from anthropogenic climate change doesn't prove anthropogenic climate change is occuring. "" Captalistslave If I wanted to prove that an invisible gas like carbon monoxide existed, showing the amount of people that died from carbon monoxide annually would be an effective method. As humans we do not take lightly the deaths of our fellow human beings. People want explanations. I contend that showing that 150,000 people die annually from man-made global climate change is an excellent indicator of whether or not anthropogenic climate change exists or not. My opponent seems to have divided my argument into two charactories. Indirect evidence and direct small non-sequitor evidence. Dismissing the indirect evidence for not being direct, the 97% consensus, and the direct evidence for being too insignificant to prove man-made climate change. The direct and indirect evidence for anthropgenic climate change is massive. Just because, I did not directly show this massive evidence, does not mean I was incorrect. I decided it was best to give a brief argument from high quality sources. Knowing that the information is avaliable and nobody wants to read an extremely long debate.

Repcon There are some scholarly peer reviewed studies that claim man made global climate change doesn't exist but they are in the vast minority. ""The 928 papers were divided into six categories: explicit endorsement of the consensus position, evaluation of impacts, mitigation proposals, methods, paleoclimate analysis, and rejection of the consensus position. Of all the papers, 75% fell into the first three categories, either explicitly or implicitly accepting the consensus view; 25% dealt with methods or paleoclimate, taking no position on current anthropogenic climate change. Remarkably, none of the papers disagreed with the consensus position."" [1] The 800 year lag is a misunderstanding of the Milankovitch cycle. ""The outgassing of CO2 from the ocean has several effects. The increased CO2 in the atmosphere amplifies the original warming.

However, the amplifying effect of CO2 is consistent with the observed warming.""

""Conclusion The empirical evidence isn't conclusive on whether global warming is happening on Mars. However, to answer the question on whether the sun is causing Earth's global warming, there is plentiful data on solar activity and Earth's climate. Many papers have examined this data, concluding the correlation between sun and climate ended in the 70's when the modern global warming trend began. So the argument that Martian warming disproves anthropogenic global warming fails on two points - there is little empirical evidence that Mars is warming and Mars' climate is primarily driven by dust and albedo, not solar variations.""[16] Solar activity from the Sun is at a low.

climate change,"Greetings and welcome to the debate. In this round, I will present my key reasons for believing that climate change is indeed real, And not a hoax, As certain political leaders have said. But first, We must define climate change. The official definition of climate change is: a change in global or regional climate patterns, In particular a change apparent from the mid to late 20th century onwards and attributed largely to the increased levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide produced by the use of fossil fuels. My first reason is that we have seen a huge increase in COS22; levels in the atmosphere, And this can be correlated with human industrial activity. In fact, Atmospheric COS22; levels are directly proportionate to human industrial activity. And, Increasing COS22; levels lead to a predictable rise in temperature. You may say that climates change anyway, And COS22; levels will fluctuate naturally, But it is no coincidence that it starts changing rapidly the moment humans figure out how to mine coal and burn fossil fuels. My second reason is that the Earth's temperature has risen by approximately 1""C since 1969. This might not seem like much, But in comparison to previous climate changes, It is vastly significant. Ocean temperatures have also risen by 0. 7""F, Killing a statistically significant proportion of the Great Barrier Reef. My final reason is that Arctic sea ice is shrinking, And polar bears may see the first iceless summer by 2050. So, We can conclude that climate change is indeed real, And not a hoax. I await my opponent's argument!",PRO,"The official definition of climate change is: a change in global or regional climate patterns, In particular a change apparent from the mid to late 20th century onwards and attributed largely to the increased levels of",21

climate change,"""Since 2000, CO2 has risen by 54% with no increase in global temperatures""? Putting aside that ten years is only three percent of our three-century discussion, the decade from 2000-2010 actually experienced the highest average temperature anomaly of any decade since before 1900. [5] This is why the fifth IPCC report's ""Summary for Policy Makers""[7] boldly stated that ""each of the last three decades has been successively warmer at the Earth’s surface than any preceding decade since 1850,"" and could also be why CON provides no source for his claim that the years 2000 through 2010 have ""experienced no increase in global temperatures."" Hans Von Storch told the House of Representatives in 2006 that ""Based on the scientific evidence, I am convinced that we are facing anthropogenic climate change brought about by the emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.""[8] CON has attempted to represent Hans Van Storch as follows: ""As described in [8], Von Storch systematically ran all the IPCC computer models of the climate, and found that the actual temperatures for the last 17 years fell outside the model predictions."" Von Storch is not an author of CON's eighth source. The source has fifteen authors, but none are named Von Storch. These fifteen authors summarize their own work as follows: ""We demonstrate that considerable ambiguity exists in the choice of parameters, and present and compare three alternatively tuned, yet plausible configurations of the climate model. The impacts of parameter tuning on climate sensitivity was less than anticipated."" At no point do they imply that ""the actual temperatures for the last seventeen years fell outside model predictions."" Sunspot activity should affect climate, and if we examine the blue shades of the following ""climate change anomalies"" chart [7], we see sunspots match the evidence provided by CON in relation to both sunspots and Pacific Decadal Oscillation, with the dip in temperatures at or near the center of the 20th century. [5] The blue shading represents models that only account for ""natural forcings"" such as Solar Sunspot Activity and Pacific Decadal Oscillation. The pink shading represents models that account for ""both natural and anthropogenic forcings."" This chart demonstrates the sharp contrast in these competing models, showing that sunspots and other natural forcings should provide a near-flat average global temperature (with curves similar to CON's first round 3 image in North America, Europe, and Africa) while anthropogenic forcings should show a sharp rise. Observations are given by the black lines, and appear to agree more with the ""anthropogenic & natural"" models than with the ""natural"" models alone. It appears that anthropogenic forcings have sharper relevance than sunspots. Con narrates his round 2 and my round 3 as follows: ""I pointed to reconstructions of climate for the distant past and the for the past 2000 years to show that climate has varied more than in recent years, and without any apparent relation to atmospheric CO2 levels. Pro argues that past climate doesn't count because we are only discussing the past century and the next century."" It would be a drastic mistake to argue that ""past climate doesn't count,"" and I thank CON for bringing this potential misunderstanding to my attention. I argued that ""The Nature article quoted by Con demonstrates that solar insulation changed the Earth's climate more in 2,000 years than the human race has in 250 years."" That is to say, the rate at which solar insulation changed the Earth's climate was more than (250 / 2000 = 0.125 ) 12.5% of our current rate of Climate change. Consistent change matters more to larger time frames, rate of change matters more to smaller time frames. This is not because the laws of physics change, in fact this is demonstrable in physics and mathematics. Because force = mass * acceleration, a constant net force of one Newton can accelerate a 1,000 kilogram car to 299,792,458 meters per second (speed of light) in 83 hours, 12 minutes [299,792,458 ms^2 / (1,000 kg * 60 s * 60 min) = 83.2 hr], but in the first hour will only bring the speed of the car to 3.6 meters per second [(60 s * 60 m) / 1,000 kg), or just over eight miles an hour. The longer the time measurement, the more relevant the ""rate of change"" or the ""rate of rate of change"" or the ""value of the exponent,"" while the shorter the timespan, the more relevant the ""application of force"" or the ""constant"" or the ""variable"" or the ""coefficient."" The laws of physics and mathematics all but guarantee that the dominant force of climate change in a 300 year timespan is different from the dominant force of climate change in a 100,000,000 year timespan. The last 50 years of climate anomalies demonstrate that the next 200 years of climate anomalies will be dominantly anthropogenic, [5] while CON's arguments are founded on a combination of 1) the last 600 million years of climate change and 2) the specific decade of 2000-2010. Does he somehow mean that solar, volcanic, botanic, and other natural factors will accelerate their rate of influence by 100,000 times over for the first time in over 600,000,000 years? CO2 follows temperature increase in ice sheets with a lag of a few hundred years when assessing a timespan of 20,000 years, which is why CON's fifteenth source numbers its X-axis in units of 1000 years before 1950. [CON-15. http://wattsupwiththat.files.wordpress.com...;] The CO2 level of an ice sheet is measured by the CO2 level, while the temperature of the ice sheet is measured by the deuterium level. Scientists aren't sure exactly how long it takes for deuterium differences to show up in ice caps, which is why CON's fifteenth source states ""Our analyses of ice cores from the ice sheet in Antarctica shows that the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere follows the rise in Antarctic temperatures very closely and is staggered by a few hundred years at most,"" rather than asserting that they have reversed the Greenhouse Effect. Their overall point is that the two measurements correllate. The 2013 IPCC report states that ""Climate change models have improved since the AR4. Models reproduce observed continental-scale surface temperature patterns and trends over many decades, including the more rapid warming since the mid-20th century and the cooling immediately following large volcanic eruptions (very high confidence).""[7] I think we can all agree that Michael Mann was wrong ten years ago, and that the graph of climate anomalies is not shaped like a hockey stick, especially since that's not the topic of the debate I instigated, of the points I have argued, or of the sources I have cited. ""Total Sea Ice is at a High""? Which is more relevant to ""total sea ice"" - area, or volume? CON made an argument about area, I made arguments about 1) volume and 2) temperature. Melting the ice caps reduces the volume, but the ice flows down and refreezes, which both warms the temperature and expands the area. Temperature is more closely linked to this debate than volume OR area. It has nothing to do with Al Gore, and the PDO is a mere blip on climate anomaly grids. ""Future CO2 levels are unknown""? ""Once they heat to a certain point, the oceans are expected to start releasing CO2 back into the atmosphere, which may include massive reserves that have been down there for millions of years."" - Me, round 1, CON has yet to respond. A technological breakthrough will not allow sunspots to catch up with Anthropogenic Climate Change before 2200. It will take them tens of thousands or even millions of years. ""Most aspects of climate change will persist for many centuries even if emissions of CO2 are stopped. This represents a substantial multi-century climate change commitment created by past, present and future emissions of CO2.""

climate change,"R3 Rebuttals ""In a study conducted by John Cook et al, the same source that my opponent has cited, it was found that majority(66.7%) of studies in relation to anthropogenic climate change were either neutral or inconclusive.[3] One must wonder why 97% of climate scientists are of the opinion anthropogenic climate change is real when the majority of evidence out there is inconclusive and there is some scientific evidence(.7% of studies out there) that anthropogenic climate change is not real, which I shall point out later. "" Capitalistslave While what you state is true, this is a red herring. As seen from your same source, the consensuses holds. ""4. Discussion Of note is the large proportion of abstracts that state no position on AGW. This result is expected in consensus situ- ations where scientists â€˜ . . . generally focus their discussions on questions that are still disputed or unanswered rather than on matters about which everyone agrees â€™ (Oreskes 2007, p 72)."" [6] The reason so many articles have no stance is due to focusing on the unanswered questions as opposed to the answered questions. ""In science, something needs to be tested over and over again and achieve the same results in order to conclude something off of it."" Capitalistslave There are false positives and negatives. The same results do not need to be achieved with 100% accuracy. ""The fact that U32; of anthropogenic climate change studies come up with inconclusive or neutral results indicates that we actually donâ€™t understand the effects humans have on climate change, and the scientists are assuming we do by taking the 32% of times that it proved anthropogenic climate change as fact, when majority of the time there is no conclusion to be made. Therefore, 97% of climate scientists, are, in fact, acting unscientifically in this case. "" Capitalistslave False, as shown above, the 97% censuses is true. ""In addition, the global temperature for over the past 136 years has only gone up by about 1 degree fahrenheit[1]. These two facts suggest that if humans have had impact on the climate, it is hardly anything to be worried about at all. "" Capitalistslave .6 degrees Celsius to be exact. That is significant considering the rate of change. Ego systems do not have the ability to adjust to such rapid change. Also, the majority of the temperature change is happening in the last few decades. [7] As for the Co2, being a small amount this is another red herring. Due to positive feedback cycles the amount is increased dramatically. You can see that in the previous debate. Finally, natural Co2 is cycled naturally, unnatural Co2 accumulates as a greenhouse gas. [12] """"The temparture has rose by 0.6 degrees in the past 120 years, 0.005 degrees annually. "" RonPaulConservative"" ""Problems with CO2 emissions claims Since there may be an increase in natural CO2 emissions, it is hard to conclude that the CO2 emissions by humans is what is causing the warming specifically. All variables need to be taken into account, which the study in my second paragraph under â€œAcknowledging opposing evidenceâ€"" that claims anthropogenic climate change happens from CO2 emissions by humans, doesnâ€™t take into account the natural CO2 emissions, the activity of the sun, or anything else that could be leading to warming of the earth. "" Capitalistslave Natural Co2 emissions counterbalance themselves, [12] sun activity is at a low. [13] Other variables have been accounted for. [10] ""In addition, it has been found in one study by Willie Soon et al, that CO2 emissions rising often follows temperature rise, and not always the other way around [5]. "" Capitalistslave The vast majority of the time, Co2 leads. This can be seen from the glacier evidence. The Earth tilts, rising the temperature, causing the oceans to release Co2. The release of Co2 into the atmosphere causes temperatures to rise further. We know this isn't happening now due to ocean acidification and more Co2 going into the ocean than out. "" Marine National Monument, finds that sea-level rise, ocean acidification, ocean warming, and other climate-related changes are expected to significantly affect the monument.""[8] ""Problems in general with anthropogenic climate change While I could continue to talk about all of the evidence against anthropogenic climate change, I shall instead provide a link to over 90 peer-reviewed scientific articles"" Capitalistslave Compared to the thousands of peer reviewed scientific articles that do support climate change. ""11 944 climate abstracts from 1991â€""2011 matching the topics â€˜global climate changeâ€™ or â€˜global warmingâ€™. We find that 66.4% of abstracts expressed no position on AGW, 32.6% endorsed AGW,"" [6] 32.6% of 11,944 is roughly 3,000 scientific peer reviewed articles that support climate change. ""there are many and various problems with it ranging from how CO2 doesnâ€™t actually affect temperature in the long-term since it balances out when water is evaporated by the initial warming"" Captialistslave Yes, there are negative feedback cycles too, like water evaporating, yet the positive is greater than the negative, meaning Co2 has an amplification effect. I will now reinforce that Co2 leads, natural Co2 cycles, and ocean acidification. ""CO2 dissolves in waterto form carbonic acid. (It is worth noting that carbonic acid is what eats out limestone caves from our mountains.) In the oceans, carbonic acid releases hydrogen ions (H ), reducing pH, and bicarbonate ions (HCO3-). "" [9] As you can read, Co2 in the ocean must be increasing due to acidification of the oceans. [10] This further proves the Co2 increase is man-made. Milankovitch Cycles proves that Co2 leads. ""As the Southern Ocean warms, the solubility of CO2 in water falls (Martin 2005). This causes the oceans to give up more CO2, emitting it into the atmosphere. The exact mechanism of how the deep ocean gives up its CO2 is not fully understood but believed to be related to vertical ocean mixing (Toggweiler 1999). The outgassing of CO2 from the ocean has several effects. The increased CO2 in the atmosphere amplifies the original warming. The relatively weak forcing from Milankovitch cycles is insufficient to cause the dramatic temperature change taking our climate out of an ice age (this period is called a deglaciation). However, the amplifying effect of CO2 is consistent with the observed warming."" [11] This also shows the positive feedback cycle of increased Co2. Despite being only a small percentage of the atmosphere. ""In the last 35 years of global warming, the sun has shown a slight cooling trend. Sun and climate have been going in opposite directions. In the past century, the Sun can explain some of the increase in global temperatures, but a relatively small amount."" [13] As for the incorect climate models, only one model can be correct. Therefore the majority will be incorrect. It would be a waste to make redunant correct models. Finally, I will end with the amplification effect. ""The authors derive a likely range for the feedback strength of 1.7-21.4 p.p.m.v. CO2 per degree Celsius, with a median value of 7.7."" [14] This shows there is greater postive feedback than negative. Although, the exact strength of the amplificaon effect is still debated.

climate change,"Main point - Every major science academy in the west supports it, 97%-98% of scientist support it. 1. 75% of the 20th century increase in the atmospheric greenhouse gas CO2 is directly caused by human actions like burning fossil fuels. CO2 levels were 389ppm (parts per million) as of Apr. 2010 - the highest they have been in the past 650,000 years. This increase in CO2 was a substantial contributor to the 1""F to 1.4""F warming over the 20th century. 2. Human-produced CO2 is warming the earth, not natural CO2 released from the ocean and other ""carbon sinks."" CO2 from fossil fuel combustion has a specific isotopic ratio that is different from CO2 released by natural ""carbon sinks."" 20th century measurements of CO2 isotope ratios in the atmosphere confirm that the rise results from human activities, not natural processes. 3. Human produced greenhouse gases will continue to accumulate in the atmosphere causing climate change because the earth's forests, oceans, and other ""carbon sinks"" cannot adequately absorb them all. As of 2009, these carbon sinks were only absorbing about 50% of human-produced CO2. The other 50% is accumulating in the atmosphere. 4. Human greenhouse gas emissions, not changes in the sun's radiation, are causing global climate change. Measurements in the upper atmosphere from 1979 - 2009, show the sun's energy has gone up and down in cycles, with no net increase. While warming is occurring in the troposphere (lower atmosphere), the stratosphere (upper atmosphere) is cooling. If the sun was driving the temperature change there would be warming in the stratosphere also, not cooling. 5. Computer models show that increased levels of human produced greenhouse gases will cause global warming and other climate changes. Although these climate models are uncertain about how much future warming will occur and how it will affect the climate, they all agree that, to some degree, these changes will happen. The reality of climate change is not contradicted by this uncertainty. 6. Although the amount of human-produced greenhouse gases may seem small to some people, their warming potential is amplified by the water vapor positive feedback loop , allowing them to cause significant warming and climate change. As greenhouse gases heat the planet, increased humidity (water vapor in the atmosphere) results. Since water vapor is itself a greenhouse gas, it can double the warming effect of greenhouse gases such as CO2. 7. Human greenhouse gas emissions are heating the planet, and climate models consistently show that this warming causes an increase in the frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones. The fact that 1975-1989 had 171 category 4 and 5 hurricanes while 1990-2004 had 269 [51] of them (a 57% increase) validates these climate models and the reality of human-induced climate change. 8. Human-produced CO2 is changing the climate of the world's oceans. As excess CO2 is absorbed, oceanic acidity levels increase. Oceans have absorbed 48% of the total CO2 released by human activities and acidity levels are 25-30% higher than prior to human fossil fuel use. 9. An 8"" rise in the ocean level has occured (1961-2003) due to human-induced global warming. Global sea levels rose an average of 1.8 mm (.07 in) per year between 1961 and 2003 and at an average rate of about 3.1 mm (.1 in) per year from 1993 to 2003. [3] This sea level rise is the result of warming waters and the melting of glaciers, ice caps, and polar ice sheets. From 1870-2004, a ""significant acceleration"" of sea-level rise occured, an important confirmation of climate change models. 10. Warming caused by human-produced greenhouse gases is changing the earth's hydrologic climate. Rainfall is increasing in many areas due to increased evaporation stemming from global warming. Higher temperatures are also causing some mountainous areas to receive rain rather than snow. According to researchers at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, up to 60% of the changes in river flow, winter air temperature, and snow pack in the western US (1950-1999) were human-induced. 11. Warming caused by human-produced greenhouse gases is changing the rate of glacial melt and altering the local climate of many regions. Since 1850, records show a ""strong increase"" in the rate of glacial retreat. From 1961-2004 glaciers retreated about .5mm per year in sea level equivalent. According to the World Glacier Monitoring Service, since 1980, glaciers worldwide have lost nearly 40 feet (12 meters) in average thickness (measured in average mass balance in water equivalent). 12. Warming caused by human-produced greenhouse gases and soot (black carbon) produced from burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, is reducing the size of the Arctic ice cap. A smaller ice cap reflects less of the sun's energy away from the earth. This energy is absorbed instead, causing air and water temperatures to rise. From 1953""2006, Arctic sea ice declined 7.8% per decade. Between 1979 and 2006, the decline was 9.1% each decade. Climate models predict that Arctic sea ice will continue to retreat through the 21st century further disrupting the global climate. [15] 13. Many organizations believe that human activity is a substantial cause of global climate change. These groups include: the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the InterAcademy Council, the Network of African Science Academies, the European Science Foundation (ESF), the European Space Agency (ESA), the Royal Society (UK national academy of science), the US National Academies of Science, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 14. Nearly all climate change studies show humans as the main cause, and studies which contradict this claim are often funded by petroleum companies, making their conclusions suspect given the obvious conflict of interest. From 2004-2005, ExxonMobil gave $2.2 million in grants for climate change research to organizations that deny human caused climate change. In 2006 US Senators Olympia Snowe (R-ME), and Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) chastised ExxonMobil for providing more than $19 million in funding to over 29 ""climate change denial front groups.""",PRO,"The reality of climate change is not contradicted by this uncertainty. ...

climate change,"The task at hand is to ""...contend that anthropogenic climate change is non-existent."" From a common definition anthropogenic means relating to, or resulting from the influence of human beings on nature. Then, from common usage ""climate change"" means a harmful rise in global temperature. This could be a difficult task. The earth's atmosphere is 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, 0.9% argon, and 0.1% trace gases including CO2.[1] Assume (for this paragraph only) that the small trace gas of CO2 (.04%) is the cause of global warming. The focus here will be upon sources of CO2 emissions both natural and manmade. The source emissions of CO2 would by a most rational people would be the cause of global warming. According to the IPCC 800 gigatons of CO2 is emitted into the atmosphere from nature and man, annually.[2] Most rational people would consider a source that is most than 51% to be the cause of a problem. Some irrational people might try to argue that 33% would be a threshold for cause. Only, crazy people would state that something that is less than 5% could be consider the cause. That brings us to the percent of total CO2 emissions from mankind. That percent of CO2 emissions is 3.62% (29 from man of 800 total gigatons)! [2] This 3.62% can not be the cause of global warming. Now, questioning if CO2 is the cause of global warming. The alarmist side uses thresholds in parts per million (PPM). 400 PPM sounds scary and 0.04% is at an insanely small amount, both numbers are the same. Imagine, how quick the alarmists arguments would be dismissed if they said that 0.04% of atmospheric gases drove global climate. Then if combined with only 3.6% of annual CO2 emissions is from man, this is an incredibly small number that man is responsible for. Using just common sense methods, it becomes very hard to believe claims made by alarmists. Anyone attempting to say 3.6% is the cause of a problem would be laughed at. Especially, when the gas in question is exhaled by each one of us. The real reasons for climate change to be anthropogenic is political and financial. Just federal grants for climate change related projects is greater than $10 billion.[3] Scientists are just as financially motivated as anyone else. A climate scientist that is outside of the mainstream will not be funded. This creates incentives to stay in agreement with those in political power. Anthropogenic climate change as a political is prefect for oppressive progressive politicians. The solutions to this false issue are more governmental control over the daily lives of harmless people. The politicians have scientist by the purse strings, this ensures compliance. This debate is about causes not effects, thus positive and negative impacts will not be addressed. 1. http://climate.ncsu.edu... 2. http://www.climatechange2013.org... 3. http://www.gao.gov...",CON,"This could be a difficult task. ...

climate change,"This is as close as the opponent comes to making an argument about cause: ""A scientific consensus exists on the reality of anthropogenic climate change. ' But there is a scientific consensus on the reality of anthropogenic climate change. Climate scientists have repeatedly tried to make this clear. It is time for the rest of us to listen.'[0]"" That is the only statement that is close to an argument about cause. Then the source basically states, science does not know, but what if. Then appeals to emotion by asking people to think about their grandchildren, thus action to reduce CO2 must be taken, you know just in case. The question could also be asked, what if the consensus is wrong? The alarmists are advocating for billions of people to reduce their living standards to keep the planet from maybe warming a few degrees. Looking at the analogy mostly used to explain green house effect, which is a green house. A few years ago I was in an empty plastic sheet green house on a sunny but very cold day. The very thin sheet of clear plastic raised the inside temperature significantly, but the owner was planning on disassembling within a few days. My question to the owner was ""would a second sheet of plastic make the green house warmer for longer?"" The owner looked at me and said ""it does not work that way"". There would be an insulation effect if there is a gap between the two sheets of plastic. Yet, this false consensus is asking us to believe that more CO2 equals higher global temperatures. From an idea that more plastic does not make a green house warmer to a question would more CO2 make the Earth warmer. There is research that suggests once there is enough CO2 to have a green house effect more will not cause higher temperatures[1]. This is outside the narrative and must be stopped. Government's need a reason for people to be scared so that controls can be forced on everyone. In summary, consensus is not science! Climate change has become like a religion for those that believe. Western civilization learned centuries ago that state and religion is best separated. Thus, policy changes based on climate change consensus should not be enacted by governments. 1. http://hockeyschtick.blogspot.com...",CON,"Then the source basically states, science does not know, but what if. ...

climate change,"I still can't tell if you are claiming that the climate is not changing at all or if you believe it is changing but for natural reasons rather than anthropogenic. Could you please clarify this in your next argument so I know what I am arguing against going forward? Now, To your arguments: 1. The 97% number may not be exactly on-the-nose, But it is around that. The study by Cook et al. (2013) which is commonly cited as the source of this number examined thousands of scientific studies on climate change and found that 97% of papers which declared a stance on the question of whether humans contribute to climate change took the side that we do. Later analysis by Cook and his colleagues of his study and others determined the consensus was probably between 90 and 100%, According to Forbes. Critics, Like the one in the video you referred to, Have attacked Cook for excluding studies which did not explicitly endorse anthropogenic climate change, Saying they should be counted as ""uncertain"" or rejecting the idea. However, Another study hilariously applied this logic to hundreds of recent geology papers and found that 0% explicitly endorsed the theory of plate tectonics, Which there is a scientific consensus on. That's because you don't have to declare that you support a theory, Like climate change, When it is no longer in doubt. Other studies besides Cook's which found similar results include Oreskes 2004, Doran and Zimmerman 2009, Anderegg et al. 2010 and Carlton et al. 2015. 2. The mass of humans vs. The mass of Earth does not mean we cannot effect the Earth. We humans have made enough nuclear weapons to kill every living organism on Earth depsite our mass being less than that of the world's termites. What matters, In this context, Is the physical properties of greenhouse gases. Gases like carbon dioxide, Methane and water vapor are penetrable to shortwave radiation (visible light from the sun) but not to longwave radiation (thermal energy; heat). This is not a property which can be faked, Or else it would easily be found out by independent investigation. So when sunlight converts to longwave radiation, The heat gets trapped by the greenhouse effect. 3. Atmospheric CO2 has no true saturation point; people who claim this based on data have usually misapplied a linear scale to CO2 concentration. The severity of CO2's greenhouse effect scales logarithmically, And if concentration is scaled by logarithm, A constant increase in the greenhouse effect is apparent, As in this graph: http://gallery. Myff. Org/gallery/171547/modtran-rad-bal. GIF 4. The corruption of a single public figure does not negate the science. Maurice Strong was an oil tycoon, Not a scientist. Anthropogenic climate change was actually discovered by environmental scientists working for Exxon in the 1970s and 80s, But just like now, The oil companies didn't want to give up their ticket to riches, So instead of switching their focus away from fossil fuels and toward renewables, They started a massive denialism campaign to convince people that climate change was not anthropogenic. The science, However, Says otherwise. Here is just a sampling of studies which support the notion of anthropogenic climate change: Karl and Trenberth 2003 Allen et al. 2006 Cayan et al. 2010 Barnett et al. 1999 Berliner, Levine and Shea 2000 (links removed because it was not letting me post with them in) 5. Tree rings are not the only proxy used to estimate historic and prehistoric climate trends--dating back even farther are the proxies of isotopic ratios in ice core samples and mineral/rock composition of particular strata--but when used, They are very effective. The trunk of a tree is actually made of secondary xylem, A type of vascular tissue which conducts water. Temperature and precipitation can both effect the width of the xylem tubes, Called tracheids, And how densely packed they are. A seasoned naturalist can identify these differences in samples bored from living trees. By observing patterns in xylem from recent years, When temperature and precipitation were measured precisely by human instruments, One can reach a point where one can correctly describe the known weather conditions from an area for a given year just by looking at a sample from a tree.

climate change,"I will present my position, and then I will state the things upon me and Con agree, then I will react to the arguments brought up by Con. My position I have stated that humans ""drive"" global warming in a significant degree. Significant is the key word here. Nobody is so naive to consider that global climate is driven only or even mostly by humans. That would be an absurd position and a probatio diabolica for Pro taking into account things like solar activity, ocean currents or vulcanic activity. I have chosen the more sane position that human activity is an important or significant factor of global warming. By this I understand that what we do with regard to greenhouse gases has consequences on the climate and ultimately on us. Consensus I agree with Con that this is a broad topic. However even from the second round there are things upon we have already agreed effectively narrowing the topic. The first agreed fact is that the climate is warming. This is an smart choice from Con, as it would have been more difficult to argue that the climate is not warming. Also, Con admits that humans have a marginal effect. I say that this effect is important. We also agree that we are talking only about greenhouse gases even if this reduces the examples that Pro can bring up. In addition I want to point out the contradiction between the second paragraph and the last paragraph of Con. In the first paragraph he admits that there is global warming and in the last paragraph he talks about cO2 increase not explaining ""stable"" recent temperatures. I want a clarification on this position as I can not counterargument both these statements without contradicting myself. I now ask Con if we can agree upon a criterion or standard that can determine what important means for this debate? A good criterion could be the answer to the question: IS IT IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO DO SOMETHING (green energy, trade caps etc.) ABOUT IT? This standard/criterion can be refined but I think it is a good start. Disensus Con states that IPCC is biased, incompetent or has a secret agenda determined by bureaucrats. In the evidence presented [1] a scientist resigned from IPCC because he feared that IPCC MAY depart from scientific objectivity. He resigned because he considers that climate change science must remain politically neutral. Furthermore no one ""imposed"" any ideas on the scientist. I demand proof that there are imposed views on such a huge number of scientists. On the other hand it would be foolish for us to think that the discoveries of climate scientists have no political meaning. Besides the science there is an also a political battle. For the sake of our debate the two must be understood separately. Bearing this in mind I must point out that Con has pointed no secret agenda or motives for the IPCC to be biased. On the other hand I can point out a clear secret agenda (from the political perspective. There are people (like Con) that deny GW for the sake of finding the truth). One example is the editing of climate change reports by the White House [2]. The other two are the founding of The Marshal Institute by Exxon Mobile (the books quoted by Con are edited by the Marshal Institute) [3] and the relentless effort by the industry to promote climate change denial [4]. Their effort is nevertheless futile: first they argued that there is no GW, then that humans have no influence, than that the influence is insignificant etc. When comparing the ""secret agenda"" of IPCC and the quite obvious agenda of companies like Exxon it is clear who has more interest to mix politics and science and to misinform. Regarding the science arguments presented by Con, I will first point out that Con did not talk about anything about the super greenhouse effect on Venus that I have previously mentioned. This example shows that greenhouse gasses can produce quite dramatic effects. So from this perspective I consider that things are clear. With regards to many of the other arguments of Con, I must point out that his strategy is flawed. He will never win by pointing out a huge number of other causes that drive the climate even if they are more powerful than Co2. I clearly stated that I will prove that Co2 has a significant effect on GW. To make things more clear (bearing in mind the simplifications), let's consider t= f (sun, volcanoes, cosmic rays, clouds, particles, Co2 etc.) + e. Con can win if he shows that: the system is not sensible to Co2 variations; Co2 variations cause a smaller temperature increase than the noise (e); Co2 receives a negative feed-back that counters its effect. By analogy, if there is a heart stroke risk of x because of eating to much fat you can't prove that this risk is smaller by showing that drinking also has a y hart stroke risk. Furthermore, in the first round I pointed out a positive feedback of Co2. Con dismissed this feedback saying that temperatures increased in the past and there was ""something"" that stopped this vicious circle. This is wrong because, as I showed in my proof, these are the highest levels of Co2 reached in 650 000 years [5]. Also, when there was warmer weather in the past there also was more vegetation to absorb the Co2. Now we have more Co2, warmer weather and less vegetation so the Co2 is not absorbed by anything at the rate by which it is produced. There is proof of this happening in the Carboniferous Era 300 million years ago [6]. Unfortunately we do not have giant forests to gather the solar heat and the Co2. The proof that shows that nowadays the Co2 levels are at a record level also dismisses the ""all this happened before and it will happen again"" argument made by Con. Con alleges that Co2 variations must have a multiplier. This is not true. It is enough for Co2 to create a 0.5 C increase for every 40% to have significant effects. Furthermore Con states that if climate would be a car than the Co2 would be an acceleration pedal. To be more exact we should consider climate a car with multiple pedals (sun, volcanoes, etc.). Some pedals accelerate the car faster (sun), others accelerate the car slower (Co2). The fact that climate changed in less than 800 years simply shows that another more violent factor was involved not that Co2 theory is wrong. Further more the lag between temperature increase and Co2 has no significance. There will be a day of reckoning since Co2 is produced at a higher rate than it is absorbed in an ever increasing temperature that prevents Co2 absorption by oceans. Furthermore, the proof presented by Con itself acknowledges that there is some (although small) correlation between Co2 and temperature. From the fact that I reestablished the credibility of the IPCC reports, I have pointed out the clear bias of the two books presented by Con, I have pointed out the contradictions between the beginning and the end of his answer, I have showed that on Venus the greenhouse effect is really powerful, I have proven that Co2 rise is steady and has no negative feed-back, I conclude that my first position stands and that GW is man-made in a significant degree.

Can science 100% proven man-made climate change? No, but neither can scientists 100% proven humans or reality exists. [10] Scientists work in probability. The best science can offer is that humans and reality probably exist. Just as man-made climate change probably exists. Humans desire there is a 100% chance of x happening and a 0% chance of y happening. Yet, as humans we don't have the luxury of omniscience.

It's important to note that sometimes a logically coherent argument may inspire emotion or have an emotional aspect, but the problem and fallacy occurs when emotion is used instead of a logical argument, or to obscure the fact that no compelling rational reason exists for one's position. "" [11] My opponent makes a strange analogy between plastic blankets and greenhouse gases. First I've already explained that Venus has a higher concentration of Co2 and is warmer. Second, my opponent using an appeal to authority fallacy, using the owner of a greenhouse as the authority figure. My opponent never adequately explains why a second sheet of plastic wouldn't make the green house warmer for longer. In fact, an insulation effect would most likely cause the greenhouse to become warmer for longer. Think wearing multiple sweaters in winter. More insulation in a house makes the house stay warmer for longer. As for a scientific consensus equaling religion, my opponent's argument seems to misunderstand what a scientific consensus is. ""So a consensus in science is different from a political one. There is no vote. Scientists just give up arguing because the sheer weight of consistent evidence is too compelling, the tide too strong to swim against any longer."" [12] In summary, the weight of evidence for science change is so overwhelming that scientists are no longer arguing and thus at a consensus. I thank my opponent for a difficult and respectful debate.

climate change,"Round two arguments Outline. I. Scientific consensus. II. Co2 is the main driver. III. The Co2 is from humans in lieu of natural. IV. Other supporting evidence V. Sources I. Scientific consensus. Claim: A scientific consensus exists for anthropogenic climate change existence. Warrant: ""Multiple studies published in peer-reviewed scientific journals1 show that 97 percent or more of actively publishing climate scientists agree: Climate-warming trends over the past century are extremely likely due to human activities. In addition, most of the leading scientific organizations worldwide have issued public statements endorsing this position. The following is a partial list of these organizations, along with links to their published statements and a selection of related resources."" [0] Impact: A scientific consensus is an agreement upon experts in the field. Think of one hundred heart surgeons agreeing upon a heart surgery technique. Heart surgeons would have more credibility than brain surgeons, dentists, and dermatologist. Even though all four are doctors, only the heart surgeons are most qualified on the subject of heart surgery. The same is true for climate scientists. A geologist, a physicist, and a biologist are all scientists. Yet, only climate scientists are the top notch for qualifications. These are the experts of experts in the field of climate science. There is nobody more qualified then this group of people. The fact that they came to a consensus based upon multiple lines of empirical evidence, used social calibration to determine what qualified as evidence, and social diversity, from many different parts of the world gives an enormous impact. The reason why social diversity is important is to avoid groupthink which can taint the consensus. ""What Is Groupthink? Groupthink occurs when a group values harmony and coherance over accurate analysis and critical evaluation. It causes individual members of the group to unquestioningly follow the word of the leader and it strongly discourages any disagreement with the concensus.

This animation shows a molecule of CO2 absorbing an incoming infrared photon (yellow arrows). The energy from the photon causes the CO2 molecule to vibrate.

climate change,"""There are some scholarly peer reviewed studies that claim man made global climate change doesn't exist but they are in the vast minority. 'The 928 papers were divided into six categories: explicit endorsement of the consensus position, evaluation of impacts, mitigation proposals, methods, paleoclimate analysis, and rejection of the consensus position. Of all the papers, 75% fell into the first three categories, either explicitly or implicitly accepting the consensus view; 25% dealt with methods or paleoclimate, taking no position on current anthropogenic climate change. Remarkably, none of the papers disagreed with the consensus position.' [1]"" - Stupidape As I had stated in my Round 3 argument, those consensuses are unreliable as they focus on a small amount of climate scientists and not all of the climate scientists as it is claimed. So you can't say 97% of climate scientists agree because 97% of people in a consensus believe in anthropogenic climate change. ""The 800 year lag is a misunderstanding of the Milankovitch cycle. 'The outgassing of CO2 from the ocean has several effects. The increased CO2 in the atmosphere amplifies the original warming. The relatively weak forcing from Milankovitch cycles is insufficient to cause the dramatic temperature change taking our climate out of an ice age (this period is called a deglaciation). However, the amplifying effect of CO2 is consistent with the observed warming.' [13]""- Stupidape The lag isn't a misunderstanding; it's evident. If you look at the graph, you can clearly see the lag of CO2 behind temperature [1]. And there have been times where CO2 and temperature went in opposite directions, which contradicts the theory of CO2 affecting temperature. ""'Though some of the CRU emails can sound damning when quoted out of context, several inquiries have cleared the scientists. The Independent Climate Change Email Review put the emails into context by investigating the main allegations.

The CRU emails do not negate the mountain of evidence for AGW.' [14]"" - Stupidape If you look at the emails in full context, you can see that the scientists manipulated data to prove their research, and knew that global warming wasn't man made [2]. ""The scientists were honest, the quotes were out of context. As for your quote from nationalreview, nationalreview is very bias.""- Stupidape Actually, according to the website you sourced, National Review has a high rating of factual reporting [3] . ""Has a right wing bias in reporting, but is well sourced and mostly factual with news."" And it's also hippocritical of you to call me out on bias sources, as your arguments are chock FULL of them. Greenpeace, one of your sources, was categgorized under ""Conspiracy-Psudoscience"", which is for sources that ""publish false information that cannot be validated or are related to pseudoscience. The information on these sites is speculation that is not supported by evidence. These are the most untrustworthy sources in media."" [4], noting on Greenpeace that it is a ""Left wing environmental activist group. Strays from science on a few issues, otherwise not too bad."" Next is Thinkprogress, which has a large liberal bias. Here's what the media fact checking website said about them: ""ThinkProgress is an American political news blog. It is a project of the Center for American Progress, a progressive public policy research and advocacy organization. Has a left wing bias in story selection and has failed some fact checks including these from Snopes.""[5]. Here you are critisizing me for using a source with a right wing bias, yet you're using a source that actually FAILED factchecks. And finally, there's skeptical science. A website started by and managed by scientist John Cook, famous for, as I pointed out, manipulated information to push his political agenda. ""However, inspection of a claim by Cook et al. (Environ Res Lett 8:024024, 2013) of 97.1 % consensus, heavily relied upon by Bedford and Cook, shows just 0.3 % endorsement of the standard definition of consensus: that most warming since 1950 is anthropogenic. Agnotology, then, is a two-edged sword since either side in a debate may claim that general ignorance arises from misinformation allegedly circulated by the other. Significant questions about anthropogenic influences on climate remain. Therefore, Legates et al. appropriately asserted that partisan presentations of controversies stifle debate and have no place in education.""[6]. As for my argument about Mars, we know enough to say that it isn't the CO2 levels. So with that in mind, and the fact that it is the closest planet to Earth, it throws the argument of man made climate change into question, for if CO2 doesn't raise Mars' temperature, then it can't raise Earth's.

climate change,"What a disappointing debate. The instigator did not provide one thoughtful argument that mankind is causing climate change, only a source that sates 97% of government funded scientists want more funding to study the issue of CO2 causing climate change. Since, scientists just don't know what the cause it requires more study. Yet, alarmist activists want every human on the planet to reduce their living standards based on possible impacts. While, the respondent to this debate provided a simple common sense discussion about the small amounts of CO2 mankind produces compared with nature. Man's less than 4% annual contributions to CO2 emissions would be considered a measurement error in a science lab. If a scientist ran multiple experiments and only had a 4% difference between results it would be considered a success. Yet, alarmists are using this tiny amount as the basis of their argument. In any other context this would be laughed at. Most people that live in cities look around only noticing the tiny part of the planet that men have modified for their comfort. With mankind's continued fight against nature, it would take back the urban areas very quickly. Nature is a robust and complex system. The planet Earth has taken a beating in the past and will in the future. Life will survive, as well as mankind. For a person to state that nature can not handle a 4% increase of CO2 in a complex system is simply naive. The instigators responses were at best weak. The accusation of a cherry picking fallacy is fallacious at best. The total CO2 emissions were included to demonstrate the extremely small amount that mankind was responsible for. Thus, bring in nature's capacity to absorb large amounts of CO2 was not necessary. A 4% error in nature's absorbing capacity and all of mankind's CO2 has be removed from the system. Looking at the IPCC's numbers nature absorbs more than it produces. Using the alarmist's logic, if mankind was not producing excess CO2 the earth would be on the verge of global cooling. There is very few alarmist out there that would be calling for mankind to increase CO2 emissions in this case. Anthropogenic climate change on Venus is a tough sell but I'm sure welfare scientists have requests for funding in at this time. Mankind does not understand planet Earth, and have a geographic advantage. Any attempt at understand Venus' climate is a pretense of knowledge. It could be there is a lot of CO2 due to heat, instead of the opposite.

climate change,"Thank you for clarifying that for me! The reason I asked is because often times people who deny that humans cause climate change also deny that the globe is getting warmer. I knew you denied anthropogenic climate change, But I didn't know if that was because you thought the climate was currently stable. Now I know going forward that you accept that the globe is getting warmer, But not that humans cause it. So let's address your objections: 1. The fact that something is widely accepted as true does not mean it cannot be questioned. However, It is more reasonable to question things which do not have evidence supporting them. I am sorry I could not link the studies I mentioned above; it was not letting me post with all the links in it. I was also unable to post with the link to the 2013 study by Cook included, But you can find it at iopscience. Iop. Org (and other websites) if you search, With quotation marks, ""Quantifying the consensus on anthropogenic global warming"" on Google Scholar. This should bring you to the 2013 study by Cook which you have ridiculed. Scroll down to Table 3, And you will see that 10, 188 of the studies expressed support for the notion of anthropogenic climate change, Which is 98. 4% of those with a declared position and 34. 8% of all studies examined. The reason 66. 4% of studies expressed no position is the same reason 0% of geology studies examined in a separate study expressed a position on the theory of plate tectonics--it's not controversial. There has been so much evidence gathered that there is a consensus. Just like how physicists don't say ""gravity is real"" in every study they do. 2. As I explained, The human species has created enough nuclear weapons to wipe out all life on Earth even though we are a relatively small portion of the total mass. Viruses and bacteria are microscopic but can cause big effects (including death) in us. So being small does not mean you can have no effect. Note also that the mere fact that humans exist has not caused the globe to warm--it's the fact that we burn so many fossil fuels. In your analogy, You said, ""It doesn't matter how much heat that those 3 grains of sand can produce. [T]hey are never going to effect the temperature of a 100 mile beach of sand. "" Well, If humans are the grains of sand, That's actually a faulty analogy because humans don't release the heat that warms the globe. That comes from the sun, Which has a mass over 300, 000 times that of the Earth. 3. As I said, The greenhouse effect of atmospheric CO2 scales logarithmically, So of course there are going to be diminishing returns in the greenhouse effect. That's not the same as a saturation point because the heat trapped is still increasing, Just more slowly. I linked a graph in my last argument showing a clear linear increase on a graph with a logarithmic scale for CO2 concentration. Note also that the most potent greenhouse gas is water. Even though the warming effect of CO2 decreases as its concentration increases, The slight increase in temperature is enough to evaporate more water into the atmosphere. That warms the globe even more, Leading to greater evaporation of water and creating a positive feedback loop which exacerbates the warming. 4. The claim that every climate scientist is corrupt is so sweeping as to be completely unfounded. There are thousands of climate scientists all over the world; you can't expect every one of them to be bankrolled by special interests or be lying about their science to the public. You might, However, Expect a small minority to be corrupt, Which is what we see in the few who claim anthropogenic climate change is not happening, Who are often funded by fossil fuels or not scientists qualified in the fields they are discussing. 5. In regards to your claim about tree rings, Precipitation is easiest climate trend to measure with them, But temperature can also be estimated based on observed patterns. I don't think I can post more than one link, So I'll just refer you to NOAA's article ""How tree rings tell time and climate history. "" Inverting graphs is not a proxy--a proxy is a something which occurs in nature which provides information about the past, Like ice cores and geological formations. An inverted graph is an example of fraud--and one which can easily be caught by the process of peer review to stop such a study from ever making it into a reputable journal.

climate change,"Correlation plus a theory is not proof CO2 dominates climate My opponent noted temperature generally rising since 1900 and CO2 rising since 1900, and claims that because CO2 is a greenhouse gas, it must be responsible for the rise. The error in that logic is that we do not know how much of the rise is due to CO2 and how much is due to other factors affecting climate. We could plot increasing consumption of charcoal in backyard barbecues, noted that burning charcoal heats the atmosphere, and then concluded that barbecuing causes global warming. The barbecue theory is defeated by showing that there isn't enough heat generated by the volume of charcoal consumed to have a significant warming effect. Similarly, Pro offers no analysis that shows CO2 to be even a significant cause. Pro has the burden to prove not only that CO2 dominated climate in the last century, but that it will dominate the next century despite all unknown factors affecting climate. Here is a reconstruction of CO2 and climate over the past 650 million years. [1. http://www.geocraft.com...] http://www.debate.org... Over geological time, clearly climate has been dominated by factors other than CO2. On the geological time scale, we are currently in an unusual period of low temperatures and low CO2. It a very complicated picture, proving that climate is far more than just CO2. Pro shows the CO2 data for the past 650,000 years.Temperature follows the same pattern, only CO2 follows temperature. The graphs are here [2. http://www.geocraft.com...] If the graphs are time aligned, the result is not that CO2 causes warming. Quite the opposite, CO2 rises about 800 years after temperature rises. Warming causes CO2 because warmer oceans cannot dissolve as much CO2. In 2013 the prestigious journal Nature published an up to date scientific reconstruction of climate for the past 2050 years. [3. http://www.nature.com...] It shows that over the period climate varied by about as much as the present warming, with both the Roman Period and the Medieval Warm Period warmer. It remains possible that CO2 is contributing significantly to current warming, but the natural variations are so large that CO2 might be inconsequential. Current climate science has no explanation for the major climate variations of the past 2000 years. That's why the discredited global warming hockey stick attempted to prove there were no past variations. Pro has the burden to prove CO2 dominates. I say it's unlikely CO2 dominates, but no one really knows. http://www.debate.org... Total sea ice is at record levels and CO2 can't explain why Pro argues that arctic ice is melting, that proves CO2 is the cause. Historically, Arctic ice melts when Antarctic ice increases in a cycle of 40 to 60 years called the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). The PDO pattern fits the cooling period from the 40s to the 70s that CO2 cannot explain. [4. http://www.drroyspencer.com...] The Arctic was last clear around 1940. Global warming alarmist scientists warned that this time the Antarctic was melting as well, and they made the confident prediction in 2010 was that the Antarctic would be ice free by 2013. What actually happened is that the Antarctic reached record high levels of ice: “The Antarctic surge is so big that overall, although Arctic ice has decreased, the frozen area around both poles is one million square kilometres more than the long-term average.” [5. http://www.dailymail.co.uk...] If CO2 warming dominates climate, it cannot be that it is overwhelmed by other factors like the PDO. But it is. CO2 theory cannot explain the pause in warming To accurately predict future climate, computer models must be proved to be reliable. We know the models did not predict ice formation in the Antarctic nor pre-1900 climate variations. In addition, global warming has essentially ceased since 1997, [6. http://wattsupwiththat.com...] so a check on the accuracy of climate models is how well this pause is predicted. Sscientists predicting CO2 crisis use many variations of computer models. The collections are called CMIP3 and CMIP5, with CMIP5 the very latest. ... Climate models cannot simulate past surface temperatures, precipitation or sea ice area. Those are basic components of Earth’s climate. … The concern about the latest slowdown in warming was addressed by a recent scientific study by Von Storch, et al. (2013) “ Can Climate Models Explain the Recent Stagnation in Global Warming? ” The one-word answer to the title question of their paper is, “No”. They stated: However, for the 15-year trend interval corresponding to the latest observation period 1998-2012, only 2% of the 62 CMIP5 and less than 1% of the 189 CMIP3 trend computations are as low as or lower than the observed trend. Applying the standard 5% statistical critical value, we conclude that the model projections are inconsistent with the recent observed global warming over the period 1998- 2012. [7. Tisdale, Bob (2013-09-23). Climate Models Fail (Kindle Locations 276-291)] The Von Storch paper is available free in draft format [8. http://www.mpimet.mpg.de...] There are a number of ocean oscillations in addition to the PDO. These are not accurately modelled in the computer simulations and likely account for the rapid warming before the current pause. The Medieval Warm Period and the following Little Ice Age correlate extremely well with sunspot activity, but no physical cause of the warming and cooling has been definitively linked to sunspots so there is nothing in the computer models representing the effects. It is not direct change in the solar radiation, because that varies too little to explain the large effect. Danish scientist Svensmark has proposed that changes in cosmic rays linked to variations in sunspots affect cloud cover by a cloud seeding mechanism, but CO2 scientists discount that, so nothing is in the computer models. [9. http://wattsupwiththat.com...] All of the climate change in the past century could be accounted for by less than a 3% change in cloud cover, but even with satellites cloud cover measurement is difficult. The cloud height is important as well as the density. We don't know future CO2 levels Everyone, crisis advocates and skeptics alike, agrees that whatever the CO2 sensitivity it is logarithmic. So if doubling CO2 produces a one degree rise, which is about the theoretical rise if there is nothing in the climate that magnifies the effect, then doubling it again would produce another degree of warming. An exponential rise in CO2 produces a linear rise in temperature. If we had a perfect model of CO2 effects on climate, we would still need to know how much CO2 is left to be produced and at what rate. Everyone agrees oil and coal are running out, but no one is sure how fast. But as supplies get scarce, prices rise and alternatives become economically viable. A technological breakthrough like a cheap, efficient battery would drop carbon consumption dramatically. It's another major unknown. A clarification of the resolution was agreed to in the debate comments so Pro must show that CO2 dominates climate in the past and future century. Pro has not made a convincing case that CO2 accounts for past climate change, nor that either computer models or carbon consumption assumptions are reliable enough to predict the future. He has the burden of proof.",CON,"I say it's unlikely CO2 dominates, but no one really knows. ... He has the burden of proof.",50
climate change,"Round four defense ""This argument that a consensus proves anything is preposterous, for a multitude of reasons. Number one, the consensus cited. This consensus reviewed 928 abstracts published in scientific journals. 928 is a somewhat large number, but not large enough to make a point off of, considering that there are hundreds of thousands of scientists in this field in the U.S alone [1]. Number two, consensuses are not reliable arguments, especially in the world of science. Scientists had consensuses on many things that turned out to be wrong, such as that saccharin led to cancer, and that the Sun's energy was a requirement for life. This consensus on climate change could be wrong as well."" Repcon First my opponent states there are hundreds of thousands of scientists within this field. That may be true, but considering each journal interviews has multiple scientist opinions changes the numbers. Furthermore, science magazine was not the only source I used. Finally, my opponent links to a long article in his/her source #1. My opponent has not met his/her burden of proof by quoting the relevant information. Having me proof a negative, that the information is not within the source would put an unfair burden on me. ""he consensus that humans are causing recent global warming is shared by 90%–100% of publishing climate scientists according to six independent studies by co-authors of this paper. Those results are consistent with the 97% consensus reported by Cook et al (Environ. Res. Lett. 8 024024) based on 11 944 abstracts of research papers"" [5] As seen here there are 11,944 abstracts reviewed in this article. As for the consensus changing, my opponent is correct, that science does come to incorrect conclusions and theories are changed to meet the new information. Despite this, this not a coin flip situation. The probability is very high that the scientists are correct in their current assessment. That man-made global climate change is real. ""In the report I just showed about death rates from weather-related disasters, Indur M. Goklany goes into that exact study, and debunks it, saying that, ""Notably, the contribution of extreme events to the mortality burden for accidental causes of death is also small (at 0.4 percent)."" Saying that we need to double down on climate change because it is .4% of the reason for accidental deaths (Not even a full percentage) is quite ridiculous. Goklany also says that, ""Although the review paper""s estimates for non-flood related deaths are problematic, if one accepts them as valid, that means that climate change currently accounts for less than 0.3 percent of all global deaths. Accordingly, based on current contributions to the global mortality burden, other public health issues outrank climate change."" This furthers the point that cracking down on global warming for something so small is preposterous. But even putting the argument aside, it doesn't even fit in with what is supposed to be debated."" Repcon Even .2% of all global deaths would be a lot. Considering ""5.9 million children under age five died in 2015, 16 000 every day "" [17] .2% of 5.9 million might not seem like a lot percentage wise, yet the absolute number of 11, 800 children under five annually is still high. An analogy would be that homicides involving guns don't make up even the top ten list of all cause mortality. Still, people tend to get upset about these deaths. Furthermore, showing people died from a cause is a good way to show that cause exists. Humans care about each other. My opponent then delves into whether not a scientific consensus occurred. I find this part of the argument confusing and difficult to follow. The fact that my opponent used pastebin only further complicates the matter. My opponent claims that the true consensus number is .3% as opposed to 97.1%. I doubt science magazine missed up by such a large error or any of the other scholarly peer reviewed articles. ""Yes, because of the regulations being put on the fossil fuel industry by the government in an attempt to stop something that is naturally occurring. So this isn't a fault of the industry- it's the government that's implementing the regulations that would drive the industry to the ground. Like the article itself said,"" Repcon I can understand the fossil fuel industries objections, but the fossil fuel industry appears to spreading misinformation. Most likely you are in denial about man-made global climate change is due to this misinformation campaign. ""Again, this has NOTHING to do with what is supposed to be discussed. It doesn't prove that global warming is man made, so it shouldn't have been brought up in the first place."" Repcon I've already proven global climate change exists, I'm only showing why there are still deniers. ""First off, it is unknown if the Koch Brothers' donations led to any biases in research. As for the scientist who is claimed to be biased, his research is supported by data looking at the sun activity and temperature over the last 100 years [6], like I presented in my Round 2 argument. And if you're bringing up funding biases, you might as well bring up the fact that the government participates in the same thing."" Repcon Yes, but independent studies have also verified government research. ""An independent study of global temperature records has reaffirmed previous conclusions by climate scientists that global warming is real."" [19] ""Our energy policy is not rigged to help the oil industries. If anything, it's rigged AGAINST the fossil fuel industry. We have regulations that, as stated before, will destroy the fossil fuel industry,"" Repcon The oil industry seems to be just fine. Just the fact that they could lose 33 trililon dollars shows their wealth and influence. ""First off, there are no crimes committed, and you haven't provided a source to back it up. Second off, jailing climate deniers is unconstitutional. One reason is known as the first amendment, which grants freedom of speech [8]. Another reason is that the U.S. isn't a facist government, and pretty much goes against facism, so good luck trying to get deniers arrested. Nice try, though."" Repcon The climate change deniers are selling false information. They are committing fraud just for starters. ""Fraud must be proved by showing that the defendant's actions involved five separate elements: (1) a false statement of a material fact,(2) knowledge on the part of the defendant that the statement is untrue, (3) intent on the part of the defendant to deceive the alleged victim, (4) justifiable reliance by the alleged victim on the statement, and (5) injury to the alleged victim as a result."" [20] Number five, injury to the alleged victim as a result, many people die annually from anthropogenic climate change. This is fraud that results in the death of the victim. This is immoral. The first amendment does not protect criminals from commiting fraud. If anyone is the fascist here it is the fossil fuel industry. The poor get hit the hardest, minorities tend to be poorer. This could be seen as the mass murder of minorities on the fossil fuel industries part.

climate change,"Final round. No new arguments and no new proof. In this round we will try to conclude and to balance the arguments presented. The debate crystallized around 2 central issues: credibility/significance of authority and interpretation of available data. With regard to the first point it became clear that the debate shifted from the credibility of scientists supporting human induced GW to the credibility of scientists and groups negating GW. This was only natural since there is more to attack and defend on the side of people negating human induced GW. Con managed to show that there was suspicion about interference in science on the side of IPCC (and IPCC only). I proved that not only all the proof presented by Con is financed by oil industry (Exxon is only one example, it didn't have to pay for all the research negating GW), but also that oil industry edited a science report which was wrote by independent scientists. Con made no reference to this Machiavellian strategy in his speech. Con also conceded that GW scientists have no secret agenda. My proof showed that people that negate GW have a vested interest in the outcome of this debate. Given the excellent record of oil companies in seeking the truth and helping their communities the reader can judge for himself/herself if the science provided by their scientists reflects the truth. In the end it is more probable that independent scientists are right and scientists financed by good willing oil companies are biased. It is hard to convince somebody of the truth if he is paid to ignore it. In the second part of the debate the reader can surely see that Con is very good at constantly changing his strategy to respond to my arguments. First he ignores the Venus example (round 1), then he does some calculations that I show to prove the Co2 sensitivity of climate (round 2&3), then he says that Venus is not actually relevant even if he agreed to use it as a case study (round 4). As his argument and his source don't explain why Venus is not appropriate for the debate, it should be taken into consideration when evaluating the outcome of this debate. I Venus is taken into consideration and correlated with the data provided by Con in the 2nd and 3rd round and the graph I have provided for illustrative purposes, then it shows that initial increases can lead to significant effects in warming the climate. This proves the topic I am advocating for. The proof showing an increase of mean temperatures and the argument regarding the balance of input and output were never clearly attacked by Con. Instead Con pointed out different causes that drive climate. When it was clear that it was not enough to prove alternate causes Con tried to redefine the ""significant"" word so that I would have to prove that Co2 drives climate change. As this is a straw man strategy I did not engage in this discussion. Instead I proved a significant effect. Also Con used a double standard with regard to the issue presented. The Co2 Theory must exactly predict everything while alternate causes don't have to. If we apply the same principle on Con causes they don't stand careful analysis. With regard to the quote from a ""BBC documentary"" [sic] I refrain from listing all the false data provided by the movie (""The Great Global Warming Swindle"") as this would be new proof. I will only point out something that already appeared in the debate and on which both me and Con agree. The movie states that there is no financing of denial (sic!) of human induced GW. This is only one among numerous errors of the movie. It is good that I didn't have to defend An Inconvenient Truth. In the end I won credibility and I won Venus. The reader can either vote for Pro or wait to see if the Co2 theory is wrong. http://xkcd.com...

climate change,"First of all, let me apologize for not making it clear what I meant by ""climate change."" Global warming is actually an outdated term when it comes to climate change, and most scientists and climate activists prefer to now call it ""climate change."" Although overall temperatures are gradually getting higher, many people try to argue against the existence of climate change by referencing years when temperatures have been lower than normal. This winter has been a perfect example of this. Therefore, when I speak of ""climate change"" I am talking about the overall shift in global temperature, weather patterns, and other climate factors that we are already seeing today. Sorry for not making that clear. Because the evidence for actual climate change is unequivocal, with 97% of global scientists supporting it, I will not take most of this argument to show the evidence. The big thing we're debating is whether or not it is caused by humans. To start with evidence that climate change is happening, let me just list a few. First of all, ocean levels have been rising for the past century, with a total rise of about 6.7 inches (which may not sound like much, but globally has large implications, especially if it continues.) In addition, the rate of rising has doubled in the last decade compared with the last century, showing that temperatures are rising, and rising fast. Second, temperatures have been rising since 1880, and the most warming has happened since the 1970s, with the twenty hottest years having been since then. Third, the extent and thickness of Arctic sea ice has been declining rapidly over the past several decades. Fourth, since 1950, the number of record high temperatures has been increasing, while the number of record low temperatures has been decreasing. Fifth, since the Industrial Revolution, the acidity of the oceans has increased by about 30 percent! I will stop listing evidence here, so I can move on to why climate change is caused by humans, but I would end by reminding Con, as I said before, the 97 PERCENT OF ALL SCIENTISTS AGREE WITH THIS THEORY. Does that not mean anything? Now for some rebuttals against why Con said before. First of all to respond to what you said about how much CO2 humans release into the atmosphere compared to the amount released by the rest of the planet. It sounds like your saying that we have released 0.00022 percent of all CO2 ever released by the earth's mantle. This number doesn't have much relevance, and I will use a different one to respond. Humans currently release about 30 GT (giga-tons) of carbon each year, while the earth emits about 780 GT a year. While this may seem to show that humans aren't the problem, it actually shows that we are. Before we began emitting so much CO2, the system was in balance, with the earth and ocean absorbing the 780 GT that it emitted. This kept the CO2 level in the atmosphere between 180 and 280 parts per million for 800,000 years. With the added human carbon emission, the CO2 level is at 400 parts per million and still rising. For another rebuttal, I would respond to what you say about how significant climactic changes have happened throughout geologic time. This is true, but this does not make the climate change happening right now any less relevant. These changes in climate you speak of are called ""Milankovitch cycles"", which have to do with the periodic oscillation of the earth's tilt, the precession of the tilt, and changes in earth's elliptical orbit. During each of these warming cycles, CO2 and temperature levels have risen and fallen TOGETHER. Also, the whole sun theory you mention at the end of your argument was supported not by ""a large body of scientific research"", but by one man, Wei-Hock Soon, who got $1.2 million funding from fossil-fuel companies. I will end with this: climate change is an extremely important and urgent topic that needs to be addressed by the world. People like you (and I mean no offense) need to stop arguing, using the tiniest facts to try and disprove something that is so unanimously agreed upon by scientists worldwide. If you don't believe in science, then that is a whole different matter, but if you do, I cannot fathom why you don't understand this.

climate change,"I propose that Global warming is indeed a real and existential threat to our planet. As you may have heard before there were periods in our planet's timeline called ""the ice age"" however most of the proof we have was amassed in the last few thousands of years which helps us graph what life was like millions of years ago using geological evidence, Fossils, Ice cores and even trees (which can date back a few thousand years) and other clues to help us understand our planet's past. From this paragraph I lay my claim that atmosphere and the crest of the planet are subjectable to human influence. based statistics and chart data from climate. Gov that Carbon dioxide's ppm has had about a 1/3 increase and the annual green house gas index has had a 45% percent increase since 1990 (relative to 1990) 1.

Sea level rising; this if it happens is predicted to displace 143 million people not to mention disrupt international trading, Food production, Land animal/plants ecosystem and living space and the planetary absorption/reflection of the sun's rays 2. Ecosystem collapse; as you might have read many animals, And plants alike are sensitive to ecosystem change causing species to die out or become reduced which could potentially allow an invasive species to come in or a chain reaction of species dying out which will decrease the earth's biodiversity and overall planetary sustainability. 3. Carbon and other particles have been rising in ppm for the most part these last few centuries, This could have a impact on the overall health and quality of life the atmosphere could provide to us by exposing us all to an unhealthy amount of particles that might impede our body's ability to function 4. As I said before currently our planet's ecosystem is strained, You might have heard about banana farms being killed off, Or species going extinct, Perhaps the killer wasp stories or the invasive species stories. Ecosystems have long evolved in such a way to even create breeds of the same species just so it thrives and contributes to a healthy ecosystem, When species' die it leaves the local area without its overall stability and vulnerable to intrusion and entropy of the ecosystem. A shoddy comparison is the free market, Where the businesses have specialized in their niche to be the best in that field that is what life has done to thrive in their ecosystems, But if you change variables suddenly some can't change fast enough and will go under. That is what happens in both the free market and in ecosystems. https://www. Climate. Gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-atmospheric-carbon-dioxide https://www. Earthobservatory.

climate change,"First my opponent says that I should have asked questions about the structure earlier in the debate but ignores the fact that, in the comment section, I did ask about the order of the debate and explain what I thought it meant. Therefore, I did alert my opponent to my confusion and my opponent either chose to ignore it or did not see it but either way I made my confusion known. Therefore, my opponent did break their own rules. My opponent then says, ""if you are so sure you are correct and there are so many climate change deniers, why don't you publish your r2-3 arguments in a peer reviewed journal?"" My response to this is that: 1. There are not many climate change skeptics. This is because people choose not to be skeptical because believing in man made global warming is how you get grants. 2. I don't publish my findings in a peer reviewed journal because they would not get published. This is because the people who choose what to publish in the journals most likely believe in man made global warming and are therefore biased against me. Another reason a journal would not publish a skeptical article about man made global warming is that if they did, then they would be accused of being funded by fossil fuel companies and would be ridiculed. Other scientists have already tried to publish their findings and it is always rejected so why should I try? What people don't realize is that by attacking anyone who has a skeptical view of man made climate change you are preventing research into that area and therefore creating a huge bias in the experiments done and articles published. In conclusion, my opponent has not rebutted even one of my claims, instead they focus on the accusations of rule breaking. Due to this absence of rebuttals, my arguments stand and therefore, based on this debate, I have proven how climate change is not much of a threat, and that global warming is not caused by man. While my opponent may of used abstracts from peer reviewed articles (as they love pointing out) I have won the debate. I have given 11 points to why climate change is not due to Co2 and given countless examples of natural disaster frequency staying constant. All of the arguments I have made in this debate go uncontested and therefore prove that climate change is not man made and that the threat is exaggerated. Due to this, all voters are mandated to vote Con under more convincing arguments and conduct. Thank you for reading this debate.",CON,"Therefore, my opponent did break their own rules. ...

climate change,"Studies Contradict Man Made Warming Anthropogenic climate change is not real. Yes, the climate changes, but humans aren't the cause of it. A study by the biology cabinet shows no relationship between CO2 and temperature [1]. ""On this assessment, the evidence points to a current natural climate change which happens sequentially in two main climate periods, icehouse and warmhouse."" Another study was found on the Vostok ice cores, which show temperature records going back over 400,000 years. Data from the ice cores reveal an 800 year lag of CO2 behind temperature [2], meaning CO2 changes came AFTER temperature. If climate change was man made, then temperature would lag behind CO2, but the opposite happens, which proves that CO2 cannot influence temperature. The ice cores also show that the temperature rose to about the same level whenever it rose significantly, which shows that it is a constant cycle and not affected by human activities. The same can be said about the CO2 levels. Manipulation by Scientists and Bribing by the Government One of the biggest science scandals, Climategate, occurred in 2009. Hackers stole emails from scientists at the East Angelia Climatic Research Unit, and statements from the emails contradict anthropogenic climate change. [3]. ""The fact is that we can't account for the lack of warming at the moment and it is a travesty that we can't... Our observing system is inadequate"" [4]. ""I've just completed Mike's Nature trick of adding in the real temps to each series for the last 20 years (ie from 1981 onwards) and from 1961 for Keith's to hide the decline."" [4]. The government as well as a variety of foundations donate billions of dollars to scientists to prove global warming is man made and to groups that put a megaphone to the global warming agenda. [5] This bias completely destroys the point of researching issues like climate change. Research isn't supposed to be ""Let's try to prove our political agenda."". It's supposed to be a non partisan look into an issue affecting our lives. How can we accept something as a fact if the people researching the issue are lying to us. The Evidence Outside our Planet One interesting thing about the warming is that it doesn't just affect Earth. Mars, Triton (Neptune's moon), Pluto, and Jupiter are all experiencing warming. But I want to focus more on Mars, since in our solar system, Mars is the most similar planet to Earth. Both have roughly the same length of day and rotation axis [6]. Its atmosphere consists of 95% CO2 [7], and is seen to be warming. In fact, Mars warmed .65 degrees Celsius in 20 years (1975-1995) [8], whereas Earth took 32 years to warm .65 degrees Celsius (from 1975 to 2007) [9]. Even though Mars' atmosphere is 95% CO2, it is still less than the amount on Earth. Environment scientist at Wright State University Jim Milks showed how the math plays out [10]. ""The total mass of CO2 in the Martian atmosphere is 95.32% volume x (44.0095/43.34) = 96.79% by mass CO2 96.79% mass x 2.5 x 1016 kg = 2.383 x 10^16 kg CO2 The equivalent calculation for Earth is Earth: Total atmosphere mass: 5.1 x 1018 kg Mean molecular mass of atmosphere: 28.97 g/mole % volume CO2: 0.04% 0.04% volume x (44.0095/28.97) = 0.0608% mass CO2 0.0608% mass x 5.1 x 1018 kg = 3.101 x 10^17 kg CO2 Last time I checked, 3.101 x 1017 kg is larger than 2.383 x 1016 kg by over 13x."" So what could be the cause of the global warming? I believe the sun is the one responsible, as correlations between the sun and the Earth's temperature have been found when studying temperature and sun levels from 1880-1980 [11], and 1980-2006 [12]. This could also explain why other planets in our solar system are warming, as all the planets rely on the Sun. But at the end of the day, the warming is NOT caused by CO2.

climate change,"Well, We've made it to the final round. Let's take one last look at your objections: 1. You said, Quote, ""The science profession is a very frivolous profession and is one that the community doesn't need most of the time. "" You say this while typing on an electronic device built by science, Probably in a building which was designed by engineers using science. If you drive a car, That car was built by science. If you ever need an operation or an artificial limb or some other medical treatment, It will be science-based. Science does not need to ""invent"" disasters to be useful. You'd be hard-pressed to find a problem can't at least try to solve. The solution to overpopulation may be to colonize other planets. The solution to plastic pollution may be to find biodegradable alternatives. Science works, And you rely on it everyday. As far as your claim that science is a sort of Illuminati dictatorship, I see no evidence this is the case. Anyone can go to college, Get a degree in science and pursue a career in the field. 2. I did not say nuclear weapons could warm the Earth the way global warming does; I said they could lead to the extinction of all life on Earth. Even though this is not climate change, It still debunks your claim that humans cannot affect the environment because the world is so much bigger than us. We can destroy life with nuclear fallout, And we can warm the globe with greenhouse gases. 3. Since it's not the topic of the debate, I won't spend too much time on your coronavirus hoax claim, But I will note that your notion of all disease being caused by a bad diet cannot account for contagion. If you spend time with someone who is sick, You are more likely to get sick yourself. That doesn't work if your diet is what makes you sick. It also doesn't explain why some people test positive for viruses like COVID-19 while others test negative, Or why doctors require patients to be tested for the virus before major operations. (I had an operation recently and was required to be tested before I could receive it. ) 4. You seem to be under the false impression that there can only be one cause of climate change and causes cannot be interdependent. You also don't seem to have considered that some causes are direct while others are indirect. You're right to say that without the sun, There would be no global warming. (There would be no life at all, But we'll ignore that detail for now and assume humans could still emit greenhouse gases. ) However, You are not correct to say that because the energy which heats the Earth comes from the sun, Humans have no effect on HOW MUCH of that energy stays on Earth. Let's examine the greenhouse effect: The sun emits shortwave radiation, Which the atmosphere is transparent to, Including greenhouse gases. Upon reaching the Earth, That energy's wavelength decreases to change from visible light to heat. At this point, The sun has NO EFFECT on what happens to this energy. The greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, However, Do. CO2, Methane and water all absorb the shortwave radiation in their particles, Which have a high energy storage capacity, Before reradiating it in all directions, Most of which lead back to Earth. 5. Yes, Clouds can make a hot day cooler. However, Clouds are not made of water vapor but rather liquid water droplets attached to airborne dust and particulates. This means the clouds do not allow shortwave radiation to pass through like water vapor. Regardless, Clouds cooling off a hot day is an example of weather, Not climate, Being affected. Weather refers to conditions at a specific moment in time. Climate is a long-term pattern, Usually spanning at least 30 years. Whatever light passes through the clouds will convert to heat and be absorbed by the water in the atmosphere when it reradiates. Closing statement: The evidence that climate change is real is overwhelming. Among the numerous attribution studies which have been done, Perhaps the most exhaustive was by the IPCC. They examined the effect of multiple factors which could contribute to the recent warming period, Both natural (volcanoes, Solar radiation, Milankovitch variations in Earth's orbit and tilt) and anthropogenic (aerosols, Changes in land use affecting the albedo (reflectivity of Earth's surface), Human-emitted greenhouse gases). It was found that the only factor which came close to explaining the recent warming trend was greenhouse gas emissions; without factoring their effect in, The climate should be effectively stable right now and perhaps even getting cooler. In fact, The contribution of greenhouse gases is so strong that it could effectively explain the recent warming trend on its own, With NO other factors considered (although this would predict a slightly more rapid warming that we see because, Again, The other factors lead to a net cooling). Therefore, Climate change is definitely real, And humans definitely contribute to it. We have it in our power to find solutions to it, But this debate is not about which ones we should or should not employ. It's just about the objective fact that it is happening.

feminism,"Greetings! Thank you for this debate, this should be fun! In accepting this debate I do not pretend to stand for all of feminism seeing as there are many different sects of the movement. I also do not claim to know everything about feminism. I will use sources from the internet as well as books to support my argument. First, we must define Feminism. There are many different types of feminism. For example: Antiporn feminism, Cultural Feminism, Hip Hop feminism, Lesbian Feminism, Queer feminism, and Radical feminism. The feminism it seems you disagree with is the one that is prevalent in the Pink Hat movement. But my stance will be from the Antiporn and Cultural Feminist movements. These movements advocate the reality: Women are more nurturing, cooperative, and communicative. Instead of measuring themselves against men, women should make their own activities more visible and valued. Want to do away with the dehumanization of women in pornography You say that feminism has ""gone too far,"" but before we can continue, give me more to chew on.",PRO,"Instead of measuring themselves against men, women should make their own activities more visible and valued. ...

feminism,"Con stated that that the Merriam-Webster dictionary is unreliable because it is biased. Con's reasoning for this was that the dictionary was made in ""liberal"" Massachusetts. Con has provided no evidence to support that it is made in Massachusetts, or how the location of the dictionary company proves that it is unreliable. Until Con proves this connection, my definition of Feminism still stands. Yet I will make it even more difficult for Con. Here are many more authoritative definitions of Feminism: Oxford Dictionary - ""The advocacy of women's rights on the ground of equality of the sexes"" [3] Cambridge Dictionary - ""The belief that women should be allowed the same rights, power, and opportunities as men"" [4] Macmillan Dictionary - ""The belief that women should have the same rights and opportunities as men"" [5] Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English - ""The belief that women should have the same rights and opportunities as men"" [6] Collins English Dictionary - ""A doctrine or movement that advocates equal rights for women"" [7] Dictionary.com - ""The doctrine advocating social, political, and all other rights of women equal to those of men"" [8] For Con to prove that the definition of Feminism is not about equality, Con must prove that each and every one of the dictionaries above is an unreliable source. If Con cannot, then this debate must concede that Feminism is about equality between men and women by definition. I suggest an alternative viewpoint: A) Feminism is about the equality between men and women, as defined in all the sources above. B) Anyone seeking to gain more than equality is not practicing Feminism (as per the definition) C) There are people who falsely use the Feminism banner to attempt to gain more than equality D) Those who falsely use the Feminism banner should be condemned E) True Feminism (gender equality) is an ideal and should be supported As I mentioned in Round 2, I support equality between men and women.

Feminism is the doctrine advocating social, political, and all other rights of women equal to those of men[1]"". Now, you admit that this is something you are for, so I guess you have problems with how feminists go about this? Really, I think your entire argument stems from a complete misunderstanding of the movement. So, what is feminism? This is a difficult question because, much like religion, feminism is different for each feminist. The mission statement of the movement is equal rights between the sexes, which you agree is good. By this definition, you are a feminist. If you could indicate how you aren't a feminist, that'd be appreciated. Maybe you disagree that there is a systematic discrimination against women, the patriarchy. Is there a patriarchy? Well, as it commonly seems to be the case, I must define ""the patriarchy"". Basically, it means a system where men are valued over women[2]. This can be shown in the wage gap[3], rape culture[4] (though men can be victims of rape, rape culture usually targets women), and gender roles[5]. Rebuttals: What you are saying here is very dangerous. Stating that feminism promotes false rape accusations is an example of rape culture. 60% of victims report abuse, and 97% of abusers will not see jail[6]. Only 1.5-8% of rape reports are fake[7], so Puh-LEASE do not try and say that considerable amount of rape reports are fake and that we should cast doubt on those few that come forward. If we are going of the definition of feminism I stated earlier, then feminists aren't trying to put men as stereotypically bad. We are trying to make men and women equal. If you think that trying to remove the bias towards men is trying to say they are bad, then I am going to have to ask you go to timeout because that idea is downright childish. In the end there you say something about ""calling the police about something ridiculous is obscure"". I think you mean absurd, but if you didn't then I'm not sure what that would mean. If it is obscure, then false rape accusations don't happen often and thus shouldn't be a problem. If you meant absurd, then I would agree that false rape accusations are deplorable, but again I would say that ""false rape reports"" is not a tenant of feminism nor is it a likely to occur.",PRO,"You claim that feminism encourages false rape accusations and stereotyping men as bad.

feminism,"As per the rules of the debate as set by my opponent, this will be my final argument. Since my opponent has failed to formulate a response, I see little need to elaborate much on my previous post. I will merely offer a brief summary of my arguments and this debate as a whole.

My opponent has offered nothing but an unsupported opinion regarding what he believes is feminism; a term of which he seems to lack a full understanding. There were no parameters set for this debate in terms of a place in which we were arguing, yet my opponent seems to have focused his argument purely on feminism in the United States. In fact, he basically concedes the debate by stating ""in 1st world countries such as the USA, there should be no such thing as a feminist. The same can not be said for 3rd world countries, where women rights have not been established and women often have to be near a man to go anywhere in the city."" Had we focused this debate on USA or first world countries alone, that statement would not be considered a concession, but the fact that we did not specify those terms shows that my opponent agrees that feminism is at least necessary in some places. Now let's ignore the fact that Con conceded the debate already and pretend we were just addressing first world countries. Con offers no sources to show that equality now fully exists, nor does he provide and decent explanation as to why feminism should disappear once success has been found. The fact of the matter is, inequality between the sexes still exists, as I showed in my previous round, and even once equality is reached here, feminism will still be important to help maintain that equality and to help spread the ideology throughout the countries where help is needed. Finally, if my arguments and sources are not enough to convince the reader, the fact that Con has only provided one poorly written paragraph backed by no sources, merely opinions, followed by a forfeited round, should be enough to win me this debate.

Radical feminism is a movement whose main focus and objective is to challenge oppressive systems within society. This is incredibly important, as this revolutionary idea is what the United States government is based upon.

I think feminism was the belief that men and women should be equal, but I proved that this is no longer the case in third wave feminism. I also reject your premise, because I stated in my first argument that MODERN feminism is harmful. My opponent has implied that it is the fault of men today that women weren't allowed to vote in some states until 1919. It was wrong that this happened, but taking revenge on men won't solve anything. In fact, it will cause embitterment between both sexes.

feminism,"Hello Ilan. I look forward to a productive exchange of ideas. I do apologize, but my response for this round won't be as elaborate since I wasn't able to respond sooner and I now have less than 15 minutes to answer lol The argument I present is that being egalitarian does not exclude you from being feminist. In fact, I argue that being feminist is a necessary condition for being egalitarian. ""feminism is merely about getting equality for women whereas egalitarianism is equality for absolutely everybody."" If egalitarianism means equality for absolutely everybody, as you stated, then it must include equality for women and therefore, feminism.

feminism,"Hi everyone I'm Ilan and I am not a feminist. Immediately alarm bells may be ringing in your mind that maybe this guy is a ""sexist"" or ""a rape apologist"" or anything of the such so just to clarify I am none of these things. I firmly believe that in the idea that everyone should be equal no if ands and or buts. And now you might be thinking why is this guy not a feminist then? Well, the answer to that question is that feminism does not have a monopoly on equality; if you believe in equality you are not automatically a feminist as many feminists like to state. I am in fact an egalitarian. The difference between the two is that feminism is merely about getting equality for women whereas egalitarianism is equality for absolutely everybody. The dictionary definition of egalitarian is ""believing in or based on the principle that all people are equal and deserve equal rights and opportunities."" and that for feminism is ""the advocacy of women's rights on the ground of the equality of the sexes."". Now that we have established some ground I can really start to get into why I am not a feminist. First of all, I am a man. And I am not trying to say that men cannot be feminists, be whatever the hell that you want, but as a man, I feel that I should campaign for my sex and as we have already established feminism is not about gaining equality for all but helping just Women to achieve equality. Even feminists that say that men and other groups are included in feminist issues still do not really campaign for our problems. One major issue that men face is prostate cancer. Prostate cancer kills just as many people as breast cancer does but receives merely half the funding towards research and cures. I have never in my life met a feminist that has agreed with the statement ""Prostate cancer is a feminist issue"" because quite frankly it is not. Many feminists also like to say that MRAs (Men's Rights Activists) are the ones that should be campaigning for male problems but if it really is for everyone then why does feminism not cover everybody's problems. Here I have merely scratched the surface of male problems that feminism does not address such as the fact that 4 times more men commit suicide than women or that 70% of homeless people are estimated to be men or the significantly less jail time for female rapists than men.

Now that I start to think about it, I don't really have a BoP, since my opponent is the one claiming that something (feminism) has a particular characteristic (sexist). Nonetheless, I will do my best to provide good reasons to reject the assertion that feminism is sexist. Reminder: Definition of feminism as stated by my opponent: '[Feminism is] The advocacy [or support thereof] of women’s rights on the ground of the equality of the sexes"" Definition of sexism as stated by my opponent: ""[Sexism is] Prejudice, stereotyping, or discrimination, typically against women, on the basis of sex."" The definition of sexism contains three important words: Prejudice, stereotyping and discrimination. I will address them one by one. Prejudice: Definition: 'Preconceived opinion that is not based on reason or actual experience' http://www.oxforddictionaries.com... Does feminism advocate prejudice on the basis of sex? According to the definition of feminism, it does not; feminism advocates equal rights between men and women. Experience (as well as reason) as thought us that a society in which everyone possesses equal rights is better of than one where that isn't the case. Therefore, one can not say that feminism advocates prejudice on the basis of sex. Stereotype: Definition: 'A widely held but fixed and oversimplified image or idea of a particular type of person or thing' http://www.oxforddictionaries.com... Does feminism use stereotypes on the basis of sex? According to the definition of feminism, it does not; advocating equality between men and women is actually a good way to ELIMINATE stereotypes, which historically have been mostly directed at women (a few examples: http://www.businessinsider.com...). Therefore, one can not say that feminism is using stereotypes on the basis of sex. Discrimination: Definition: 'The unjust or prejudicial treatment of different categories of people, especially on the grounds of race, age, or sex' http://www.oxforddictionaries.com... Does feminism advocate the use of discrimination on the basis of sex? Again, according to the definition of feminism, it does not; advocating equal rights is a good way to make sure that we live in a JUST system. Feminism actually seeks to eliminate the idea that men and women are 'different categories of people'. (I have already covered prejudice). Therefore, one can not say that feminism advocates the use of discrimination on the basis of sex.

feminism,"I realised I have joined a pitched battle. The google search ""Arguments supporting feminism"" has actually turned up only pages of arguments against feminism. I'm not even joking, You can see for yourself. And I must say, Even though this will look bad in the voting period, ALL MY OPPONENT'S ARGUMENTS ARE VALID Because of this, I will have to make my own arguments. Feminism is a complicated subject. The base idea of equality and possibly superiority has picked up many supporters that are toxic human beings in general. The confusion ensuing from less smart people joining a once-noble movement has muddied the waters greatly. But, Even though a large chunk of feminists are hypocritical, Discriminating, Patriarchy-screaming people, They are not all bad. There are some feminists that directly argue an egalitarian agenda, Even though they don't proclaim themselves as egalitarian. Sure, A lot of women don't want to be bricklayers or plumbers or fast food workers, But do men really want that either? Do you grow up as a kid thinking: I want to work at a sewage plant for half my life! You don't. But if an egalitarian agenda is fought for in the name of equality for women, Then the people who screw up and need to work an undesirable job would become equal. And that is true equality. In some areas, Feminism has overreached in ways of red herrings or kind politeness. (Looking at you Amy Schumer) However, In some ways, It hasn't gotten far enough. While it is possible to sue a sperm donor for child support and win, It is also possible to have a president with 21 sexual misconduct allegations including a teen beauty pageant. While rape jokes are frowned upon by most people, When the roles are reversed they become funny again. The concept of the 'perfect girl' is still a thing focused upon by too many girls in my school, Middle aged mothers, And recently graduated college students. Women's ability to vote was just the beginning. Another recent event that has come in the name of equality is the 'me too' movement. Allegations should always be taken seriously, But if they are false, The victim has to own up to his or her lies, And the bad news around the blamed person should be cleared up. In a perfect world, That's how it would be. But it isn't a perfect world. It's a world with greedy, Misaligned people who falsely accuse or suppress true accusations. People who, Up until very recently had no troubles with that underground gas line. In conclusion of this paragraph, Feminism pushes a good point under this topic. In an egalitarian movement, Everyone has the right to express whoever they want to be. This is not something I see in my school. There are about 50-150 girls in my school that if you put them side by side, You would have trouble telling the differences. I have talked with my ex as well as other girls about this standard, And they always shut down the idea of embracing their ideals as if they were scared of the concept. (As you may be able to tell, I'm not the average teenage boy) The feminist movement pushes strong, If not necessarily equal women. A mixture of feminism (as in girls being strong too) and egalitarianism (Everyone having equal advantages and disadvantages) Would be the best way to go. So, You may not be wrong in some points of your argument, But you are incorrect in your stance against ALL forms of feminism. Some responses: Quote: ""Women's suffrage is not 'feminist, ' and it was the result of a shift in culture and subsequent advances a result of the introduction of birth control and other scientific advancements. "" Was it right and just that women got to vote or no? Quote: ""should be treated equally to men. "" What about the double standards? Should girls be treated like they shouldn't cry and need to compete in sports? Should men be forced to cook and tend the babies for women who have higher income than them? Thank you for your recommendation, But I will stick to what I said. Yes, We are different, But we are still equal. We are all intelligent to a degree and had the same ancestors. So, Women should be exactly equal to men. There is a difference between equality and equity. Equality is where everyone gets treated the same no matter what, Equity is where everyone gets exactly what they need to come out equal in the end. Quote: ""And that makes them angry"" This is both a micro-aggression and stereotyping. Do all feminists or even all contemporaries become angry at the concept of a person not being fooled by a lie? A look at ""The New Yorker"" reveals that feminism itself recently shattered. With one side becoming ""so soft they're becoming useless"" and one side becoming ""too strict an ideology. "" And you can't argue against both. You argue against the contemporary movement, Which is more women>men, But you fail to realize there are two more pieces of the shattered movement. The contemporary movement is the biggest, And the loudest, And the most hateful, So it is the one plastered on all the news sites. But the original movement still stands. Brave women who want to be soldiers, Who want to feel equally safe, Who want to compete, Who want to preform physical labor, Who want to live their life to the fullest in co-existence with everyone. They fight for the concept that women=men. In conclusion, Some feminism is bad, As with every group in existence, But some of it is good too.

""they are not subject to daily acts of microaggression"" I learned the term and definition of microaggresion from South Park, So take that with a grain of salt, But the point still stands. Second, My opponent is changing their definition of feminism to fit their own arguments, Calling points of equality strived for by many ""Not feminist"" I never claimed my opponent was arguing against the people. I claimed that he is arguing against ""all forms of the idea"" of which even the smaller forms need to be taken into account. Yes, People prefer to make fun of the postmodern movement, But what about movements of the past? Equal pay, Equal opportunity, Equal rights. Those were in the name of feminism. An argument for equality of outcome is exactly what we need, No? Outcome being how people are treated and respected on the streets. Outcome on where we end up when we start to die. Similar to giving people glasses so that they can see as well as any other person. If female biology means that they need a little bit more help to have quality-of-life equal to men, Give them that help. "" There is no reason for a false-victim to own up to her lips as she's a victim of the patriarchy. "" There is every reason for a false victim to own up to lies. Accusations destroy lives almost as much as the assaults themselves. Being a minority does not excuse you from ruining someone's life because you feel like it. Switching the roles, If a man were to accuse a powerful woman of something she didn't do, And ruin her image in the process, He would receive so much hate he would basically need to go into witness progression to escape it, Especially if it was false. The argument presented was seeing the accusation from the POV of only the postmodern feminists. Maybe not all women want to be held equally accountable for their actions, But surely some don't like the fact that exposing themselves to a police officer might get them out of a ticket. Surely some feminists want equal responsibility for their gender. And if some want it, Then not all of feminism is wrong. "" they're emulating a perceived ideal"" That ideal is what is wrong. If a girl wants to be like that, Nobody is stopping them. But if the girl wants to be different or wants to stand out, The fear of being looked down upon by guys or friends scares them into conforming. One is normal, Two is a coincidence, More is a trend, But doesn't it get to a point where it seems unnatural? Does it not seem like some of the girls may not want to be the polite little princesses they are? Sure, It is a societal norm, But that doesn't mean that the ""strong woman"" portrait of feminism won't help them be themselves a little more. I argue a focused point and make it broad, But that is basically the standing ground of my argument. I argue to prove that not all feminism is bad, And if any parts of feminism are truly good, Then your argument against all forms will lose. Some say the good of a few outweighs the bad of the many. I say the good points of feminism can eventually be seen past the dyed hair, Self-centered screeching of the individuals that stole the spotlight and cast a negative shadow.",PRO,"Being a minority does not excuse you from ruining someone's life because you feel like it. ...

feminism,"I accept this debate. My goal is to provide evidence that feminism is a logical and correct argument. Feminism can be defined as ""a collection of movements and ideologies aimed at defining, establishing, and defending equal political, economic, cultural, and social rights for women. This includes seeking to establish equal opportunities for women in education and employment. A feminist advocates or supports the rights and equality of women."" [1] In a society where both men and women are required to reproduce life and keep our species existing, it should only be logical to think that both genders should be granted equal rights. Of course there are biological differences that result in certain inequalities, but having different biological make up should not be grounds for unequal rights. Throughout human history, males have maintained a level of dominance over females more often than not. This is largely due to the biological make up. Men have a higher rate of basal metabolism than women, meaning they have a greater capacity to expend energy. Men are also 50% stronger than women in terms of brute strength and the lung capacity for women is 30% less than that of men [2]. All of these biological traits helped lead to men being more dominant in societies where physical strength and ability was the key to survival; when hunting for food and fighting in hand to hand combat were necessary for survival. But the female biology, while very different, should not be viewed as subordinate. Though a female body generally posses less brute force than a male, it serves other functions that males cannot; functions necessary for the continuation of our species. Thus it should be logical that both sexes deserve to have equal rights in a society, even if they serve different roles at times. Also, as our societies continue to experience technological advancements in various fields, certain factors that used to cause a greater division between the sexes, such as child birth, are becoming less significant. As we understand more about pregnancy and child birth, the risks involved with child birth have decreased and doctors understand far more about what the female body goes through during the process, so they are far more capable of aiding in the recovery following birth than in the past [3]. This all boils down to the fact that equal rights for the sexes is the logical way. This does not mean that we should not acknowledge or celebrate the differences between the sexes, but in terms of political, economic, social and cultural rights, both sexes should be on equal footing, since both sexes are required for us to continue existing on this planet. Finally, I just want to clarify that we are dealing with Feminism here, which is as I defined in my opening statement, and not radical feminism. Many see feminism as a group of man-hating women who want to take the power away from men and have the women as the dominant group. ""Radical feminism aims to challenge and overthrow patriarchy by opposing standard gender roles and oppression of women and calls for a radical reordering of society"" [4]. Too often people think of this when they think of feminism, but such is not the case in the same sense that Muslim extremists who commit international acts of terror do not represent the entirety of the Islamic faith. The bottom line is that females should have every right to vote, they should be paid based on their professional skills and they should be given equal opportunity to work a job, so long as they are qualified to do so. I believe that equality in gender rights is the logical and correct path. I await my opponent's opening arguments. Thank you. [1]http://en.wikipedia.org... [2]http://www.drjamesdobson.org...

Rape has nothing to do with the rights of women. Rape is simply an action performed by an ignorant human. Women can rape too.

feminism,"From the time the Constitution was signed in 1776 to today, I'm pretty sure everyone can all agree that feminism has caused some major changes in American history. Because of feminism, women have gone from having no place in the workforce to complete legal equality to men. Just a century ago, women could not even vote. Look at us now. It is possible that a woman will be the President of the United States in just a few short months. Despite what your opinion of Hillary Clinton is, you must admit this could be a major step for American history. Unfortunately though, women in certain other countries do not have equality to their male counterparts. Many middle eastern countries with Sharia-based laws are no where near the gender equality level of America. In some regards to marriage, women have much less of a say on who they can and cannot marry than men. Sharia law basically restricts a Muslim woman from marrying a non-Muslim man. This does not apply to Muslim men. Under Sharia law, if a women wants a divorce from her husband, his consent is required. However, if a man wishes to divorce his wife, he simply has to say ""talaq"" (I divorce you) three times. Above all else, in my opinion, one of the most sickening parts of Sharia law has to do with restrictions on a woman who has been sexually assaulted. If a man rapes a woman, under Sharia law, she could be forced to marry him. All these reasons and many more are why feminism is still needed today. It may not be needed to enforce legal equality in America anymore, but it is so desperately needed in the middle eastern countries that follow Sharia law.

However, I do not feel that this is truly what the feminist community holds to. In my experience, I have found that much of feminism has been about the ""patriarchy"" (I wont get into that) and seems to paint men as evil, and the reason behind the evil in our society. While it could easily be said that this has all been from the extremists, I have yet to run into a feminist who isn't an ""extremist."" Before I get incredibly off topic, I would like to thank my former adversary for breaking down feminism without an argument riddled with fallacies. That was the first time I've truly heard a legitimate counter argument to my points that wasn't riddled with red herrings, emotional appeal, straw men, and just overall ridiculous claims. I still do not agree with feminism, simply because I believe that instead of individual groups that focus on the rights of a certain gender, race, nationality, ect... we would be much stronger if we all united and fought for all human rights, where ever we are needed.

feminism,"I thank my opponent for his second round of rebuttal. I would like to start by addressing my opponent's complaint that I neglected the 'women's right' part of the definition of feminism. While I grant that I did not downright say the words 'women's right' everytime I talked about equality, I thought that it was obviously implied. I do not see how someone can talk about equality in society without obviously referring to equal rights; the only things that society can actually change are human rights. So, to me, that was obvious, but I apologize to my opponent for the misunderstanding. Most of my opponent's arguments seem to be focused on convincing me that that the laws he presented (VAWA and Selective Service) are sexist, but my arguments had nothing to do with that. So, for the remainder of this debate, let's work under the assumption that I grant that these law are indeed sexist. Now, my arguments were focusing on the association that my opponent makes between these laws and feminism. My opponent claims that, since these laws treat women differently than men, they must be feminist in nature and therefore feminism must be sexist. As I said earlier, that is an unsupported association. According to the definition of feminism, a law could be considered feminist if it supports equal rights between men and women, not if it supports women in general. Does my opponent thinks that the VAWA and the Selective Service support the latter? If so, then they are not feminist. Therefore, pointing to these laws as a justification for claiming that feminism is sexist is unjustified. 'I agree that we are addressing the IDEA of feminism, however, rather than argue that the focus of Feminism on women's rights specifically is sexist, i chose to argue that the laws that are supported in order to give women equal rights in America is sexist.' The problem is that the laws my opponent has presented are not promoting EQUAL rights and therefore cannot be associated with feminism. My opponent then completely misunderstands my analogy, focusing on what atheism and feminism are rather than actually addressing my point which was basically that you cannot judge an ideology by its abuse and misuse (because then you are judging people, not the ideology), which is what my opponent seems to be doing with feminism. It has nothing to do with what atheism is. 'PRO tries rebuts my arguments by attempting to argue that since Feminism does not support the VAWA, it cannot be sexist' No... what I'm saying is that since feminism is not the support of the VAWA, one cannot point to this law to accuse feminism of being sexist. My opponent then tries to explain why he associates the VAWA with feminism, claiming that they both support women's rights. But my opponent is doing exactly what he accused me of doing; he is leaving out part of the definition of feminism, focusing on the 'women's rights' aspect and leaving out the 'equality of the sexes' aspect. Then my opponent goes on to explain how Selective Service is sexist which is, as I have said, irrelevant. 'The argument is not for prevention of the law, the argument is against misapplication of rights' I would ask my opponent to clarify what he means by 'misapplication of rights' so that I can answer this point. The analogy with taxes seems rather pointless. The conclusion I draw from this round is pretty similar to the one I drew for the last round; once again, my opponent is confusing the idea of feminism with some aspects of society that favor women.

feminism,"The Case against Feminism There are many reasons to stand in opposition to Feminism, I will outline 5 below. 1. Anti-Egalitarian Misandry Often these two words get confused (Feminism and Egalitarianism). Feminism is not, And has never, Been about universal equal-treatment. In fact, There are many cases feminists will stand in opposition to male rights in order to bolster their own. This is especially evident in their vehement opposition and mischaracterization of the Men's Rights Movement. 2. Self-centred A wise, Blue-haired, Shrieking harpy-demon once told me: ""Why is it always women that are expected to center everyone else""s issues in their movement? "" Truly, I've never heard something so profound in it's implication. One may argue that since the feminist movement juxtaposes women against men, They do not care who they must step over to achieve a perceived state of ""equality. "" In other words - the leaders of the movement want power, And are willing to sacrifice empathy to obtain it. 3. Deconstructionism This is more a jab at the contemporary feminist movement. I'm going to use Nietzsche here, Because the postmodernists like him so much. Read: [1][2] In the same way a weakling may rationalize his weakness, The postmodernist rationalizes the failure of socialism. A smart man could never be fooled by such a rationalization, And this makes them angry. The truth is that American culture has always been gynocentric, And the postmodern feminists know this. This thought burns them deeply resulting in seething anger. The feminists regularly gleefully attack the foundational values to our society gleefully and use ""sexism, "" or ""misogyny"" as an excuse. This is the equivalent of saying: ""I could never create something to rival your traditions, So I will attack what they value most. "" 4. Hypocritical I'm not going to spend much time here as it's quite self-explanatory. A feminist expects us to respect them and their actions while behaving in obscene manners and disrespecting us. I will not respect you because of your genitalia - I will respect anyone unless given a reason to do otherwise. 5. Counterproductive As it turns out, The majority of women do not want to be soldiers, Firefighters, Bricklayers, Or scientists. In attempting to achieve equal representation they are stomping upon the ideals of females who have chosen to be caring mothers, Nurses, Or poets. When treated equally, Gender differences in choice widen. [3] A brief response Quote: ""Also, For clarification, ""In all forms"" do you mean including women's suffrage? "" Women's suffrage is not 'feminist, ' and it was the result of a shift in culture and subsequent advances a result of the introduction of birth control and other scientific advancements. Quote: ""Women should be exactly equal to men. "" No, They shouldn't because we aren't equal in many regards. I'll recommend in the next round you rephrase this to: ""should be treated equally to men. "" Quote: ""I am against some feminism, Primarily the radicals, The 'victims' and the idiots. "" I would say feminism in it's current state IS radical, And the majority of women aren't feminists.

feminism,"Sorry about my argument for the last round, apologies to Mr. Wanless for having his account closed. I will now present an argument in the hopes that Charlie_Danger's account is reopened. Feminism: a doctrine that advocates equal rights for women. [1] Pointless : [2] 1 : devoid of meaning : 2 : devoid of effectiveness The current idea of Feminism is pointless. In the 60s or 70s, Feminism did have a point, it did work to make voting rights for women etc., however Feminism as it is today, is pointless. The idea of Feminism defeats itself. Feminism is what women want to make sure they are treated equally as everyone else, however, they use Feminism as a tool to provide them with certain rights that no one else can have. These include inflated pay, etc., [3]. With this new breed of Feminism we have just created a group of misogynistic women who prefer double standards to men. In addition to this, there are some women who face unnecessary backlash from Feminists. These women are those who would prefer to stay at home with their children, who like being subservient to their husbands and who enjoy doing domestic work. Feminism is a doctrine that advocates equal rights for women. It no longer advocates equal rights for women but more tries to create a double standard and give them more of an ""edge"". Therefore it is devoid of its original point, therefore it is pointless. I don't really care one way or another about Feminism, I just found it an interesting topic.

feminism,"I thank my opponent for instigating this debate. Definition(s): 1. Feminism: ""Feminism is a collection of movements and ideologies aimed at defining, establishing, and defending equal political, economic, cultural, and social rights for women.""[1][2] Premise: There has been, and still is, a prejudice against certain people. These prejudices have resulted in much abuse, but the female sex has been abused, and mistreated more than many others. It was not until 1919 until women were allowed to vote, and were considered equal in the eyes of the law[3], it was only in 1993 that the United Nations first passed a resolution for the protection of women rights[4], and despite this even today women are abused, beaten, and have to face glass ceilings.[5] Stance: I will be advocating for Feminism as a positive philosophy where feminism is the belief that women, and men should be treated equally in all formal respects such as law, merit of job, education, et cetera. I will attempt to show that my opponent has a misguided understanding of feminism, and has no basis nor proof of the statistics he cites. I shall be presenting two positive line of arguments. 1. All Are Born Equal 2. Women Are Yet Mistreated LOA1: All Are Born Equal ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."" -Declaration of Independence Even here the word ""man"" is used. This may seem to be a ""free doctrine"" when in fact here ""man"" is not gender neutral, and does not apply to dark skinned men, or women. In fact this only applied to white men. Even in one of the greatest documents of history, one finds prejudice. Though the document does get one thing right: that each person is born with inalienable rights, and all are equal. Including women, girls, or members of the femine gender. Women are also sentient creatures, and possess the same cognitive abilities, reasoning capacities, as men. Thus we asert that women are in fact equal to men, and it would be much perverted of our opponent to disagree and state that women are in any view ""inferior"" At this point we have won this debate. For so long as the belief that women and men are equal is prevalent the philosophy that they should be treated equally is naturally acceptable. That is truly what feminism is, not a doctrine which states that women are superior to men, or exactly the same (after all there are biological differences), but rather that women have the right to be treated equally in formal matters. They should be entitled to the same court benefits, the right to vote, the same education, the same salary, and the same treatment as men of equal caliber.

feminism,"I thank my opponent for his rebuttal. My rebuttal will address both Round 2 and Round 3. My opponent started his rebuttal by accusing me of basing my argument on the definition of feminism... I plead guilty as charged, but I fail to see how this is a problem. My opponent then clarifies by saying that I excluded how feminism is applied in the real world. Let met be clear about something: if the topic of the debate was 'Sexism is sometimes used by people who consider themselves feminists', then I would have sided with Pro and there would be no debate. But the topic addresses the IDEA of feminism. Let me make an analogy to express this: Let's say the topic was 'Atheism is a violent ideology' and that I argued that atheism has nothing to do violence. Then my opponent's response would have been something like 'Well look at the Soviet Union who killed millions of people in the name of atheism'... The fact that someone used atheism as an excuse to do violent things does not mean that atheism is a violent ideology, in the same sense that people using feminism in a sexist way does not make feminism sexist. Now let's see what my opponent means when he says that feminism is sexist. In both Round 2 and Round 3 my opponent points to the VAWA to illustrate how feminism is sexist. Even if I was to concede that the VAWA is sexist, it is absolutely irrelevant to the topic of the debate; feminism is not 'the support of VAWA', pointing to a so-called sexist law (I would have to do more research to find out if it is actually sexist) does not make feminism sexist any way. In Round 2, my opponent accuses feminism of 'allowing the Draft and Selective Service to only affect men'. That is a pretty weak argument; saying that feminism is sexist because it did not do anything to prevent a certain law would make basically any ideology who did not say anything about it sexist as well. Atheism is not against that law either, is atheism sexist? 'Why do I bring up the Draft and Selective Service? I bring it up because Feminism is supposedly a movement to support gender equality, but it chooses to only support those things that benefit women (voting), over those things that would harm them (compulsory public service). While i would not suggest women should be conscripted when the need arises, I am arguing that there should be a similar system by which women must buy their right to vote.' I am really having trouble understanding what my opponent means, is he saying that women should invent a useless law just to make sure that they have something to do before they can vote? 'PRO also argues that feminism is the key to eliminating stereotypes. I am not convinced. Even basic stereotypes against women carry a corollary stereotype against men.' I agree with the last part, but how is that an argument in favor of my opponent? Wouldn't getting rid of stereotypes against women also rid us of some stereotypes against men? In a nut shell, Con's argument is that since there are some aspects in society that favor women, feminism must be sexist. That is a non-sequitur and an unfair association. I hope that my opponent can provide me with adequate evidence that supports the assertion that feminism is sexist.",PRO,Then my opponent's response would have been something like 'Well look at the Soviet Union who killed millions of people in the name of atheism'... ...

feminism,"That is not only sexist, but also wrong. We still live in a world where women are not paid as much as men. We still live in a world where women are victims of rape. Not a few of them, not tens or hundreds of them, but thousands upon thousands. We still live in a world where single mothers are denied jobs and looked down upon, and when they do find a way to support their children, they are still judged by the society they are members of. So what do you want women to do? Stop fighting for what we deserve? Equal pay, respect, safety, the ability to live our lives the way we want to? There are countless examples of instances, laws, and events that still undermine women's rights in the present. Women deserve to live as equals to men and feminism is how that equality is created. Feminism is not poisoning the minds of women, hostility and fear are poisoning the minds of people like you. Being a feminist does not mean hating men, or using violence and hatred to break those who are not feminists apart. Being a feminist is simple; it is actively advocating for the rights of women. Feminism is what allowed for people like Malala Yousafzai to liberate herself from oppression and not only receive an education, but a voice that affected millions of young girls worldwide. Feminism allowed Oprah Winfrey to become one of the most successful American entrepreneurs in history and create an empire that charitable and ethical. For crying out loud, simply google famous feminists and you will find not only some of the most impressive women in history, but some of the most ridiculous obstacles placed in their way. Modern feminism is just as important as feminism of, say, the suffrage era. When will we ever be truly equal if people can say things like ""Good is good enough, the wage gap isn't that big"" or when politicians can make blatantly offensive comments directed at the female gender and not be held accountable? It may seem like there is no need for the fight to continue, and that women are where they want to be, but that is false. That is one of the reasons I imagine you would begin this debate; because you do not believe it is necessary. The second reason is that you possibly have had a bad experience with a feminist. With every philosophical group, especially groups related to theology, there are always sub groups referred to as extremists. The most notable example being Islamic extremists such as ISIS, who aren't even correctly identified seeing as they do not practice that faith in it's essence. The point is, not every Muslim is a terrorist in the same way not every feminist is a male hating, propaganda spewing monster that many men claim them to be. There will always be people who mis represent the groups they are associated with, but if we continue to react violently and curse what the group stands for on the basis of a fraction of their supporters, we will all lose. The third and final reason I would guess this turned into a debate is that you are sexist, and I really hope this is not the case. Because I know for a fact you have or have had a woman in your life; a mother at least, possibly a sister, aunt, cousin, friend, girlfriend, whoever. And I know that you probably love this (or these) women and would hate to see them trampled on by the community they live in. So what I'm really saying is, if you believe like I do that they deserve to be treated and seen as the beautiful, strong, and independent people they are by the rest of the world, then you too are a feminist.",PRO,"There will always be people who mis represent the groups they are associated with, but if we continue to react violently and curse what the group stands for on the basis of a fraction of their supporters, we will all lose. ...

feminism,"I would like to thank my opponent for his last round. My opponent starts by saying that the definition of feminism assumes that 'women have rights that are not equal to men's, and given this, it is necessary to advocate for them'. I agree with my opponent AND with the assumption. He then points out the fact that presume that 'women's right' are the same as 'human rights'... once again I plead guilty as charged and I hope I'm not the only one who does; in my opinion women ARE human and therefore women's right ARE human rights. I'm surprised that this is even an issue and that is why I didn't consider it important to provide an explanation. Then my opponent goes on to say that since feminism focuses on women's right, it necessarily follows that it is sexist. Well, according to the definition of sexism provided by CON, it does not follow. Focusing one's efforts on making sure that women have equal rights is neither prejudicial nor stereotyping. One may be tempted to say that it is slightly discriminating, but it isn't either; feminism does not strive to eradicate or diminish men's right, it strives to make women equal to men in terms of rights. My opponent then reiterates his explanation for connecting the laws he presented with feminism: ""The reason why this is crucial to my arguments, and truly this whole debate, is that it leads to the support of laws that are made to support women's rights. Such things as protection under the law and voting are some rights that can be, and have been, advocated for. As such, they fall into the realm of 'feminism'..."" Yes, fighting for the right to vote is feminist because men had the right to vote when women didn't. But this has nothing to do with the laws he presented. 'PRO's attempt to argue that a law is only feminist if it supports the equal rights of men and women is flawed, as the only mention of equal rights of the sexes is in reference to justification for the advocacy of women's rights.' Yes, I argue that a law is only feminist if it falls into the definition of feminism, which I think is a pretty good way to assess it: if a law doesn't advocate women's right on the ground of the equality of sexes, then it isn't feminist. He then restates his explanation regarding the supposed weakness of my analogy, making the exact same mistake once more: he is comparing what atheism is with what feminism is, which was not all what I was trying to do. The analogy with taxes IS pointless for a reason that I have already addressed: pointing to sexist events or aspects of society (a non-existent one in this case) and associating them with feminism only because they favor women is purely a non-sequitur. In conclusion, my opponent's argument is basically that since there are laws that favor women over men, feminism must be sexist. He associates feminism with any law that favor women, disregarding the definition of feminism. As I have previously said, most of my opponent's arguments would have been great in a debate where the topic was 'Sexism is often used by people who claim to be feminist', but it isn't. As my opponent and I have both said, we are discussing the IDEA of feminism, and one cannot judge the pros and cons of an ideology by pointing to how it is used by people (for reasons I have previously explained).

I did not recycle any of my arguments personally, Though you're welcome to do so if you cite the source. Have you tried Google Scholar? I also think you may be under a misconception so let's clear it up now. I am arguing against feminism, Not against feminists as individuals.

""But if an egalitarian agenda is fought for in the name of equality for women"" By fighting for something in the name of specifically women you've ruled out the possibility of it ever being egalitarian. ""The concept of the 'perfect girl' is still a thing focused upon by too many girls in my school, Middle aged mothers, And recently graduated college students. "" The only reason this could be harmful is if the women/girls are alienated from this endeavour. It happens, But this isn't rectifiable by feminism. ""Another recent event that has come in the name of equality is the 'me too' movement. Allegations should always be taken seriously, But if they are false, The victim has to own up to his or her lies"" Could you explain the results of this movement in detail, It seems you may be excluding a few crucial details [4]. Under a feminist culture, There is no reason for a false-victim to own up to her lips as she's a victim of the patriarchy. ""In an egalitarian movement, Everyone has the right to express whoever they want to be. This is not something I see in my school. There are about 50-150 girls in my school that if you put them side by side, You would have trouble telling the differences. "" Is anyone forcing all 150 of these girls to behave and act in the exact same manner? It seems to me that isn't the case and that they're emulating a perceived ideal. Individuals are defined by their differences and groups by their similarity, We'd do well to remember this. ""Was it right and just that women got to vote or no? "" Sure it was, But it isn't a feminist concept. ""Yes, We are different, But we are still equal. We are all intelligent to a degree and had the same ancestors. So, Women should be exactly equal to men. There is a difference between equality and equity. Equality is where everyone gets treated the same no matter what, Equity is where everyone gets exactly what they need to come out equal in the end. "" Saying ""women should be exactly equal to men"" is an argument for equality of outcome. We are not equal in terms of biology or psychology, Which makes sense considering the psyche has a physiological grounding. [5][6] This is an unachievable ideal and pursuit of it always results in bloodshed. ""This is both a micro-aggression and stereotyping. Do all feminists or even all contemporaries become angry at the concept of a person not being fooled by a lie? . . . You can't argue against both.

He claims women can join the army now, but yet they only represent 14.6% of the US military [1]. 2) Just because a movement has succeeded (which feminism has not yet fully accomplished, as I will show further on in this argument), that does not mean the movement should be shut down. Once goals are reached, it is still important to work to maintain the achievements that the movement fought for. 3) Once feminism does fully succeed in the US and other first world nations, the success of the movement can be used to help the third world countries that are much farther behind, as my opponent admits. Feminists should not (and do not) only aim to help women in their own countries; feminism is a global movement that aims to help equalize rights for all women. So if success is found in some areas, feminists can take that success elsewhere and look to help other women in need [2]. My opponent also makes the claim that he believes men are now subordinate. He again provides no data or sources for his claim; only that men are forced to fight in wars. This is an odd argument, given that earlier my opponent used the example of females finally being allowed to fight in the army as proof that equality exists, but then claims that men are the ones forced to fight in wars. If it is equal as you state and women are allowed in the army, that renders your second argument void because women are now allowed to fight as well. In reality, it is true that more men still fight and die for their country, but is that because they are subordinate or because for a long time, women were not permitted to do so? Now I want to provide some numbers that show why feminism has not yet fully succeeded in the United States. Women in the United States still make $0.77 to every $1.00 a man makes [3]. There can be many reasons for this gap, but it has been this way for some time and does not seem to be changing much. Many high paying professions may shy away from hiring women due to the potential for pregnancy and maternity leave. Many women may choose to work only part time jobs because their spouse already has a high paying job, and someone needs more time to look after the children. Whatever the reasons, the fact of the matter is, pretty much across the board, women don't make as much money as men do. Even childless women still only make 82% of what their male counterparts make, so pregnancy and maternity leave are not the only cause for this gap [4]. The fact is, in most occupations, a woman's salary is less than that of a man's in the same occupation [5]. My opponent's claim that feminism has already succeeded was not backed by any sources and I have just shown how gender equality still does not fully exist, even in the first world countries. I have also shown that even if feminists did succeed in achieving equality in the US and other first world countries, they still would have a role to play in maintaining the equality that they achieved as well as aiding in the feminist movements on a global scale. The feminist movement is necessary now and moving forward, to ensure that women are treated equally and can obtain and maintain equal rights in all countries across the globe.

What your title implies is that you are part of a modern feminist movement that would support things like equity over equality. Women have the same rights as men in the U. S so for you to be promoting classic feminism isn't anything people take issue with. It is the status quo. If you want to talk about the gender pay gap we can but it isn't a symptom of oppression. More women choose to go into fields that pay less. The difference between pay in each field is nominal. It's really a non-issue because we aren't going to force people into fields they don't want to do. We definitely aren't going to artificially inflate other fields for the sake of equity.

feminism,"It's good to see you do not hate feminism because you are a misogynist. But there is one tiny thing in feminism that in itself is not wrong: Men and women having equal rights and oppertunities. The only thing is that the men's side of it is often ignored. But the fact that over the centuries women have been treated as nothing more than objects and property of men to be disposed of at any time gives them a reason to feel victimized. It is easier for men to be against feminism because over the years society has favored, respected and raised them to idols while women were crushed down, oppressed, disrespected and treated as nothing more than baby machines. Feminism would be looked at as much more positive if they would focus more on men's problems but i think the thing people forget its that sometimes when they reject feminism, the embrace masculism. and i think masculism is just as hypocritical ad feminism, some masculists want to put women down and raise men up once more and what makes that anymore right than vice versa? masculists want women to give up their jobs and be the traditional housewife and bear and take care of their children but get angry when custody goes to the mother if they divorce and go on a rant about it.

feminism,"Thank you for accepting my debate, these are my arguments: Feminism is irrelevant in the 21st century and the idea of its existence is stupid altogether and here's why: 1. Feminism is only recognizable in the First World countries where feminism is no longer needed. 2. Feminism rarely addresses issue that men also face, which is ironic considering feminism is created for the equality of both men and women. An example of this, is men dying in wars and in the wilderness. Most feminists don't want to admit that both men and women both suffer whether it maybe present or in the past 3. Women who call themselves feminist barely do anything besides constant whining. If they really do care about other women they would be fighting for other women's rights in third world countries. 4. All feminists blame the plight of women solely on men (aka ""the patriarchy"") and not various social and economic issues in society. 5. When you argue with a feminist they usually say ""you don't know what its like to be a woman"", instead of telling us the relevance of feminism in the modern age 6. Patriarchy is nonexistent. If it were to be true, women wouldn't have the ability to vote, drive, study, get jobs, or get abortions. 7. All feminists are almost always based on the individual's self-interests and not in actual gender equality. They want men to be subservient to women and use feminism as the way to achieve this goal. They want rights handed to them that would no longer benefit men, but do not want to get rid of the ""traditional"" gender roles that have benefited women. 8. The RICH have always held power, not men. In fact, basic human survival dictated women have always had to be more important than men, because men cannot get pregnant and continue the species. Women have always been more important than men, which is why women never had to fight in wars or do the laborious work in society, up until recently. 10. Feminists are sexist without even realizing it. They victimize women to the point one might think all women are handicapped weak and helpless frail members of society, when they are not. 11. Feminism has its own agenda of self-interest. 12. If you don't label yourself as such, you're apparently against them. Feminism loves to recruit and wage wars more than working towards a common goal. 13. Most women don't hate men (or see them as intellectual inferior and ""not responsible for their own stupidity"", or blame them for everything bad that happens to them), thus, couldn't be feminists. 14.

Call men stupid, weak, helpless, fools, and laugh at the idea of their penis getting chopped of by a psycho woman? Its okay to feminists, but don't you dare call a woman stupid, weak, helpless, fools, or laugh at the idea of female mutilation! 15.

feminism,"It's my pleasure to debate you. 1) Establishing the definition of feminism From Wiktionary {1} Noun feminism (countable and uncountable, plural feminisms) 1. (obsolete) The state of being feminine; femininity. [from 1851; less common after 1895] Q95; 2. A social theory or political movement which argues that legal and social restrictions on women must be removed in order to bring about equality of both sexes in all aspects of public and private life. From Encyclopedia Britannica {2} Feminism, the belief in the social, economic, and political equality of the sexes. Although largely originating in the West, feminism is manifested worldwide and is represented by various institutions committed to activity on behalf of women""s rights and interests. From Merriam Webster {3} Definition of feminism 1: the theory of the political, economic, and social equality of the sexes 2: organized activity on behalf of women's rights and interests 2) Conclusions from definition As you can clearly see, equality is inherent to the definition of feminism. If someone violates the tenets of feminism, i.e., equality of sexes, it is not the definition of the word that is compromised, but merely the integrity as a feminist of the individual that violates it. A simple syllogism suffices to demonstrate this: Belief in God and Jesus Christ makes one Christian ""Man A"" believes in God and Jesus Christ ""Man A"" is a Christian And of course, the contrary holds true as well: Disbelief in God and Jesus Christ makes one non-Christian ""Man B"" doesn't believe in God ""Man B"" is not a Christian No one would argue that if a man who claims to be Christian denounces the existence of God, Christians no longer believe in God. That man simply stops being a Christian. This same logic will apply to feminism as well. Belief in the equality of sexes makes one feminist ""Woman A"" believes women are superior to men ""Woman A"" is not a feminist Therefore your premise is flawed, in that the conduct you described would not be the conduct of feminists. 3) Refutation of opponent's points Of the three points my opponent makes, none actually support his premise that feminism is not equality, as they are all sensationalist promulgations with no facts to support them. You claim some women hate all men and wish they were all dead. This is probably true, as there are many women in the world, and it's more likely than not that at least one of them feels this way. However, the same applies to men as well, and there is likely at least one man that wishes all women were dead. Neither of these points say anything about either group as a whole, as those individuals have no mandate to speak for those collective bodies, whether the body in question is man, woman, or feminism. The claim about the wage gape has no bearing on my argument. If a (female)feminist is being payed less for the same work as a man, she would no doubt be upset and wish to rectify the situation. If she is being payed equally then she will be content. As far as employment goes, women work in every profession mentioned by my opponent. I consider these three points I've made so far as self-evident, and believe they require no substantiation. Pro's testament that there are also female rapists is not salient to the discussion. It is also worth noting that the two sentences in conjunction in his second paragraph seem to imply that men are being raped by women in prisons. The is completely untrue, and the source used to support it is a study on men being raped by other men in prison. Of course in the U.S., the world leader in incarceration rates{4}, this couldn't possibly happen as prisons are gender segregated. The second source provided by my opponent is just a blog reflecting the opinions of one who is not an authority on the subject, and is not credible for sourcing. 4) Summary In summary I would like to leave a quote that bolsters my two avenues of argument (definition of feminism, poor sourcing and presentation from my opponent). ""Feminism is an interesting word. It suffers from being an """"ism"". First, people make the assumption that feminism is only for women. Second, people mistake feminism for an ideology, something you either believe in or not, and third, many people still view feminists as dogmatic or dangerous. The irony is that these stereotypes are exactly what anti-feminists have wanted us to believe, since the suffrage movement began in the 19th century. As I see it, true feminism is simply to stand up for equality. In the words of Gloria Steinem, ""a feminist is anyone who recognises(sic) the equality and full humanity of women and men."" Where does this come from you ask? It is an excerpt from an article titled ""Equality isn't just a women's issue, it's a human one"", written by Carlos Moedas. The interesting thing about this is that I am not the one who introduced this article to the debate. This is a direct excerpt from the article linked to by Pro's third source, which contradicts his own argument, and strongly supports mine. {1} https://en.wiktionary.org... {2} https://www.britannica.com... {3} https://www.merriam-webster.com... {4} https://en.wikipedia.org...",CON,"If she is being payed equally then she will be content. ...

feminism,"Feminism is defined as ""the advocacy of women's rights in the grounds of political, social, and economic equality to men."" So many people still wonder why we need feminism, why any woman in this day and age would call herself a feminist. The word itself has become a dirty word. Instead of seeing it as something good, the idea of feminism has been warped and shaped into something cruel and oppressive, something that supports abortion on demand. Feminists are seen as man haters and women who want to take over and eliminate men. Many still ask the question ""Well why do you still need feminism? Women have the right to vote, go to school, own property, etc."" We need feminism because if someone never told them they were wrong, men would always treat women as objects, like a subordinate, like property. Feminism is the fight against this. But that's over now, right? That's no longer necessary? We fought our war, but now we are done, right? Men have not evolved from their original nature. Men have not surpassed and outgrown their feeling of superiority over women. Every single thing a woman does is sexualized. Girls are sent home from school for wearing yoga pants because ""It's distracting to the boys."" Fifty year old men will cat call 12 year old girls on the street. Girls are taught to walk down the street with their key between their fingers in case they are attacked. In cases of rape, women are asked, ""Well what were you wearing?"" We are told ""You must have been asking for it."" Girls are taught to cover themselves up instead of teaching boys not to rape. According to the Institute for Women's Policy Research, ""In 2014, female full-time workers made only 79 cents for every dollar earned by men, a gender wage gape of 21 percent."" Feminism is not a hateful idea. Feminists are people who believe in equality of the sexes. Yes women have the right to vote and to own property. Yes we can go to college. But we are not yet treated equally.

My opponent says that feminism is called what it is because, in history, there have been more instances of inequality towards men than women. This is true. However, now I believe society is equal, so there is no need for feminism. Instead, I think we need to pay attention to the larger collection of human problems. Starvation, sicknesses, oppression of women IN THE MIDDLE EAST, murder, and all of the other issues humanity faces should be a priority. Not focusing on a problem that does not even exist. I meant men for my third argument. Typo. But other than that, my argument stands strong. I am curious as to why my opponent forfeited the last round.

WHAT IS MODERN FEMINISM? Con: ""Modern feminists (Hillary Clinton, Michelle Obama, etc.) support pushing for women to not only be equal but actually have MORE rights and privileges than men."" Hillary Clinton seems to like equality: ""Equal pay is not yet equal. A woman makes 77 cents on a dollar and women of color make 67 cents... We feel so passionately about this because we are not only running for office, but we each, in our own way, have lived it. We have seen it. We have understood the pain and the injustice that has come because of race, because of gender. And it's imperative that... we make it very clear that each of us will address these issues."" -- Hillary Clinton [9] And Michelle Obama doesn't seem to support Pro's statement: “No country can ever truly flourish if it stifles the potential of its women and deprives itself of the contributions of half of its citizens. .... Leadership is about creating new traditions that honor the dignity and humanity of every individual. Leadership is about empowering all of our people— men, women, boys and girls,” she said. “When we commit to that kind of leadership across the globe, that is when we truly start making progress on girls’ education.” -- Michelle Obama [10] Are these isolated viewpoints in modern feminism? No. The following are all quotes by feminists living today or within the past 5 years: ""In my heart, I think a woman has two choices: either she's a feminist or a masochist."" -- Gloria Steinem [4] “A feminist is anyone who recognizes the equality and full humanity of women and men.” -- Gloria Steinem [1] ""I always get asked, ""Where do you get your confidence?"" I think people are well meaning, but it's pretty insulting. Because what it means to me is, ""You, Mindy Kaling, have all the trappings of a very marginalized person. You're not skinny, you're not white, you're a woman. Why on earth would you feel like you're worth anything?"""" -- Mindy Kaling [2] “Feminism is the radical notion that women are human beings.” -- Cheris Kramarae [3] ""We've chosen the path to equality, don't let them turn us around."" -- Geraldine Ferraro [4] ""People think at the end of the day that a man is the only answer [to fulfillment]. Actually a job is better for me."" -- Princess Diana [4] ""We cannot all succeed when half of us are held back."" -- Malala Yousafzai [6] ""We still live in a world in which a significant fraction of people, including women, believe that a woman belongs and wants to belong exclusively in the home."" -- Rosalyn Sussman [4] “Equality is not a concept. It's not something we should be striving for. It's a necessity. Equality is like gravity. We need it to stand on this earth as men and women, and the misogyny that is in every culture is not a true part of the human condition. It is life out of balance, and that imbalance is sucking something out of the soul of every man and woman who's confronted with it. We need equality. Kinda now.” -- Joss Whedon [5] ""Feminism is not a dirty word. It does not mean that you hate men. It does not mena you hate girls that have nice legs and a tan, and it does not mean that you are a bitch or a dyke, it means that you believe in equality."" -- Kate Nash [6] ""Feminism has fought no wars. It has killed no opponents. It has set up no concentration camps, starved no enemies, practiced no cruelties. Its battles have been for education, for the vote, for better working conditions…for safety on the streets…for child care, for social welfare…for rape crisis centers, women’s refuges, reforms in the law. If someone says, “Oh, I’m not a feminist,” I ask, “Why, what’s your problem?”"" -- Dale Splender [7] ""I guess I am a modern-day feminist. I do believe in equality. Why do you have to choose what type of woman you are? Why do you have to label yourself anything?"" -- Beyonce Clearly, many major voices within modern feminism have loudly supported equality. WHAT IS ""TRUE"" FEMINISM? Con: ""The real feminists (Sarah Palin, Michele Bachmann, etc.) are the women that want EQUAL treatment, rights, abilities, and opportunities."" I'll agree that Sarah Palin broadly agrees with feminism. However, consider how close she comes to the quotes I've presented above: ""I'm a feminist who believes in equal rights and I believe that women certainly today have every opportunity that a man has to succeed, and to try to do it all, anyway. And I'm very, very thankful that I've been brought up in a family where gender hasn't been an issue."" -- Sarah Palin [12] It seems clear to me that ""modern"" feminism and ""true"" feminism are very likely one and the same. On the other hand, Michelle Bachmann seems somewhat against feminism: ""I rise today in opposition to this bill [creating a bipartisan commission to study the idea of putting a women’s history museum on the National Mall] because I believe ultimately this museum that will be built on the National Mall, on federal land, will enshrine the radical feminist movement that stands against the pro-life movement, the pro-family movement and the pro-traditional-marriage movement."" -- Michelle Bachmann [12] Michelle Bachmann's viewpoint appears to be closer to that of Con: That feminism today seeks bad goals. SUMMARY Simply because there are some feminists who support female supremacy, does not mean that the whole of feminism (or even modern feminism) is invalid. Ultimately, ""modern"" feminism is fundamentally the same as ""true"" feminism. Back in the 70's, there were similar feminist extremists; neither then nor now are they a majority or influential. In the same way that all movements have bad apples, feminism has problematic members. Just because the civil rights movement had black supremacists and violent protesters does not mean civil rights was wrong. Again, we must look at feminism as a whole. And as a whole, feminism today continues to support the goals of equality between the sexes. [1] http://www.goodreads.com... [2] http://www.huffingtonpost.com... [3] http://www.goodreads.com...

All feminists blame the plight of women solely on men (aka ""the patriarchy"") this betrays an incredibly weak understanding of feminist theory, which I would get into if Pro hadn't dumped a huge amount of, frankly, moronic arguments on me for me to rebut.

Further, yet another blanket statement. >5. When you argue with a feminist they usually say ""you don't know what its like to be a woman"" Blanket statement, furthermore I'd contend that the burden of proof is on you - you have categorically failed to fulfil this burden.

If it were to be true, women wouldn't have the ability to vote, drive, study, get jobs, or get abortions. This betrays, again, an unbelievably limited understanding of what the concept of patriarchy actually entails, which is that of historically male dominated society's prejudices being carried forward. Obviously there have been large strides toward sexual equality but it seems illogical to state that it's been eliminated - further, it seems that if men and women are indeed equal there would be roughly the same amount of men and women in high-paying jobs - some discrepancy, furthermore, would be acceptable, but the level we see is illogical and cannot be due only to randomness. >7.

Most women don't hate men (or see them as intellectual inferior and ""not responsible for their own stupidity"", or blame them for everything bad that happens to them), thus, couldn't be feminists. Right, that's the fourth straight misconception on the nature of feminism. Let me clear this up. Feminism is: The advocacy of women's rights on the ground of the equality of the sexes.[1] It holds that there exist power structure which are bad for society (and as such both men and women) and as such should not exist. Next round, I'll hold forth on why these power structures do exist and therefore feminism isn't unncessary, >14. Many feminists have double standards beyond just benefits and ""privileges"" in society. Call men stupid, weak, helpless, fools, and laugh at the idea of their penis getting chopped of by a psycho woman? Its okay to feminists, but don't you dare call a woman stupid, weak, helpless, fools, or laugh at the idea of female mutilation! First, spare me the false outrage.

My word! You've actually gotten something right! Feminism holds that gender roles which have been established by historical society are bad and limiting on both men and women and as such should be abolished. That's pretty much it. In summary, Pro's argument rests upon three things. 1.) Blanket statements about ""all feminists"" which he then attempts to use to make normative statements on the nature of feminism. These can be disregarded with no proof. 2.) A fundamental misunderstanding of feminism. It's useless to tussle over whether feminism is stupid or not if you don't fundamentally understand it. 3.)

feminism,"Well I haven't had a decent debate in a couple months and and figured why not discuss feminism in modern day North America (when I say this I'm referring to Canada & the US of A, sorry Mexifriends). I've been having a lot of ""good"" back-and-fourths with Stefy about feminism and equality and such in comments and polls and whatever, so if she could accept I'd love it, but if someone else does I'd be just as happy. So as anyone who knows me on this site would already know, I'm against modern feminism in North America. I find it nothing more than an excuse to get women special treatment and put down others in order to make feminists look good. It ""unknowingly"" fights for female superiority under the guise of ""equality."" I don't want to get too into this right now so I'll leave the first round for my opponent to open with arguments as to why feminism is or should be necessary in North America.

feminism,"To begin, my opponent misunderstands the issue that I have with their use of the definition. There is an assumed difference between human rights and women's rights within said definition. It is assumed in the definition that women have rights that are not equal to men's, and given this, it is necessary to advocate for them. My opponent presumes that ""women's rights"" equal ""human rights"", without an explanation of why we should conclude this. If it is assumed that ""women's rights"" are ""human rights"", there is no reason to advocate for women's rights specifically, and thus it necessarily becomes sexist that feminism focuses on women. This argument from my opponent does not refute what I have said; it actually reinforces it. My opponent also, once again, fails to address Sexual and Domestic Violence laws, and wholly misunderstands my position. I have already explained my reasons for connecting these laws to feminism: ""The reason why this is crucial to my arguments, and truly this whole debate, is that it leads to the support of laws that are made to support women's rights. Such things as protection under the law and voting are some rights that can be, and have been, advocated for. As such, they fall into the realm of 'feminism'..."" This is from Round 4. PRO's attempt to argue that a law is only feminist if it supports the equal rights of men and women is flawed, as the only mention of equal rights of the sexes is in reference to justification for the advocacy of women's rights. (See Feminism definition per Round 1) PRO's argument fails to address this. PRO then argues, per Tu Quoque, that I am guilty of the exact same act, of neglecting portions of a definition. However, that is exactly my point. By advocating for women's rights, feminism creates a situation wherein ""the equality of the sexes"" is not the result; rather, a bias towards women, and against men, is the result. Again, PRO's argument supports my position. PRO seems to be interested in my argument against her analogy, despite my reasoning as to why it is to be viewed as weak. Again, I shall refer my opponent and the audience to my arguments regarding this: ' What do atheists advocate for that is definitive of atheism? What advocacy do atheists support that is definitive of atheism? Perhaps the only thing that could be argued here, in relation to advocacy, would be a removal of religion from major institutions. This might be considered advocacy on behalf of rights, insofar as freedom of (and from) religion is concerned. However, this is not a crucial part of the atheist position. Again, I say that PRO's analogy is weak, as there attributes that Feminism has (mainly activism) that Atheism does not have as part of the ideology. As such, we start in a position where any Argument from Analogy cannot stand. My analogy begins with two ideologies that promote the rights of two groups, that then produce two different results. Then, my opponent critiques my Tax Analogy as ""pointless"". Simple Rebuttal to a Simple Assertion: No, it isn't. Complex Rebuttal: My analogy is closely related to the current situation with voting rights. Men must sign up for Selective Service (at least in the US) in order to earn the right to vote, effectively paying a higher tax (as to refuse carries harsh consequences), while women simply turn 18 (effectively paying little to no tax). I would argue there is indeed a point, as this actually elucidates the terminology used. I attempted to keep my arguments in this round as close to the arguments that I have already presented as possible. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I shall now make my Closing Statements. My position was that Feminism is Sexist. In the pursuit of Women's Rights, there are instances of inequality, with a bias towards women, and against men. These biases as evident when one obesrves Sexual Violence, the VAWA and Domestic Violence laws, and Selective Service and Voting. I presented arguments that I believe justify making a connection between Feminism and these laws, which I have mentioned above. Each of these areas have had a plethora of activism in relation to how they affect women. Meaning that these laws have special considerations for women (VAWA, Sexual Violence), or at least do not address women (Selective Service). This leads to a scenario wherein women are advantaged, and men are, by comparison, advantaged. I have provided an analogy that I believe displays this. In my refutations of PRO's arguments, I argued for the weakness of the ""Atheism-Feminism"" Analogy, pointing out the flaws that are present in the decision to compare the two. I then provided my own analogy, which I view as stronger than the one provided by PRO. In relation to the arguments provided by PRO, I pointed out the flawed reasoning present in PRO's inclination to argue through the secondary clause of the definition provided. I mentioned that to argue that utilizing the clause ""equality of the sexes"" to attempt to refute my arguments is not a strong form of argumentation, given that the equality of the sexes is simply the grounds which justifies the advocacy of women's rights, it is not that for which feminists advoacate. Given the arguments provided, I believe I have provided strong reasons to believe that Feminism is indeed sexist. My job was to argue against the reolution, to the effect of ""Feminism is sexist"". PRO was to argue in favor of the resolution, to the effect of ""Feminism is not sexist"". To the voters, if I have given sound reasons for the sexist nature of Feminism, refuting the resolution, Please vote CON. If PRO has provided arguments to negate mine and affirm the resolution, please vote PRO.

feminism,"REBUTTALS Con: Your argument saying that it's basically okay to want female superiority does in fact show that modern feminists are BAD! Nowhere do I say this. Con, feel free to quote me to prove this point. Con: 1. The wage gap is a myth created to divide us as a people. Yeah, no. A wage gap exists. CONSAD agrees [13]; the Bureau of Labor Statistics agrees [14]; the Joint Economic Committee agrees [15]; the Government Accountability Office agrees [16]. And really? Someone created it to divide people? In response, I'll argue that people who think the wage gap doesn't exist (such as Con) are all part of a gigantic international conspiracy to cause division over gender issues, and can't be trusted. Con: 2. The difference between Hillary and Sarah is that Hillary is a democrat and known for living off other peoples money and Sarah is a hard working republican. Rrrright. I'm gonna wait for the sources that prove Democrat = Bad and Republican = Good, and that Ms. Clinton is a moocher while Ms. Palin is not. Con: Modern feminism, once again, wants EVERYTHING handed to them. Real feminism wants a CHANCE (which they have equally) to be successful and want to earn everything they are given. Thank you. Con didn't bother addressing the ~20 quotes I brought up above, which show broad support from modern feminism behind the ideal of equality between men and women. In fact, Con has done no effort whatsoever to prove that modern feminism actually supports female supremacy. SUMMARY There's no reason to vote Con. Con has failed to show that modern feminism is for female supremacy. Con has no sources for any of their claims. Con uses incendiary rhetoric to appeal to emotion.

feminism,"To begin with, the vast substance of my opponent's text does not address my points at all, in fact it seems to not even acknowledge the existence of my side of the debate, instead following a narrative of women having more rights than men. Maybe they do, maybe they don't. I have opinions on this, but they are hardly pertinent, as the premise of the debate is the definition of feminism(Feminism is not equality), not that women or men are treated better or worse than each other in modern society. There is an explanation as to why Pro's argument only lightly skirts mine at the beginning and end, and not at all in the core of it. This is a bit embarrassing for me, but here it is: http://thoughtcatalog.com... Youngastronomer's entire dissertation from ""1) Women have the right to genital integrity..."" to ""...And maybe you do, too."" is taken verbatim from this article, written by Janet Bloomfield. It is certainly not standard conduct in a debate to have one side call upon a third party to come and argue their case for them. It is a minor detail, but seeing as the vast majority of my opponents response was written by someone else, I feel that this occurrence merits notice. I have explained in the first paragraph why the aforementioned text does not refute my arguments, and the same rebuttal there applies to the points of ""Women can accuse men of rape without evidence"" and ""Guilty until proven innocent"", namely the fact that we aren't discussing the current conditions of sexual-based institutional biases. My opponent also raises the etymology of the word ""feminism"", positing that if you are going to adhere to the narrow dictionary definition of feminism, why not take it a step further and and use the origin of the word. He also claims that feminists "" shy away from analyzing what a root word and a suffix add up to"", implying that that analysis will contest with the views on feminism I have purveyed. This is not at all the case. The word feminine means ""of the female sex..."", ""feminine, female; with feminine qualities, effeminate""{1}, and the suffix -ism means ""word-forming element making nouns implying a practice, system, doctrine, etc.""{2}. To summarize, the most literally meaning would be, ""the practice of being feminine"". Actually, when the word was coined(c. 1851){3}, this literal interpretation would have been more insulting to women, as at the time traits valued in woman were things now seen as negative characteristics, such as complacency and servility. In conclusion the etymology of the word provides no support for Pro's case of feminism meaning superiority of women. Finally, this debate is a contest of semantics. Semantics are a sub-field of semiotics, or the study of symbols. Semantics is specifically the study of words(symbols) and meanings. Words are symbols, and they connote meanings. When I say ""chair"", you can interpret that symbol and think of a chair. This basic principle is what I outlined in my previous syllogism, a principle that was never even contested by my opponent. Here is an example to reiterate. Currently 10% of Protestant ""Christians"" in America don't believe in God{4}. Let's imagine this number rose to 51%. Would we now say that Christians are people who don't believe in God? Of course not, because the meaning of someone who believes in Yah'Weh and Christ being Christian has seniority over this new ""Definition"". That meaning has long since been codified as what it is today. This applies to feminism as well. If Pro wanted to defeat my argument, his task would be to demonstrate why such unimpugnable authorities, such as Merriam Webster and Encyclopedia Britannica, are erroneous in their definition of feminism, a feat which he never even attempted. Pro has blundered fatally in using the wrong word to represent what he was trying to argue against. Perhaps a more appropriate premise for my opponent would have been, ""Third-Wave Feminism is not equality"". {1}http://www.etymonline.com... {2}http://www.etymonline.com... {3}http://www.etymonline.com... {4}http://www.simpletoremember.com...",CON,"It is a minor detail, but seeing as the vast majority of my opponents response was written by someone else, I feel that this occurrence merits notice. ...

feminism,"I keep trying not to take debates, and then I see one like this and I have to. So by the Topic of this we can clearly see that Con is against feminism. It is on him to meet the BOP, and show that feminism is in fact bad. It is my job to undermine him and show that it can be good, and the purpose of it as a whole. Feminism - the theory of the political, economic, and social equality of the sexes http://www.merriam-webster.com... I will offer some contentions. Contention 1 The purpose of the feminism movement. My adversary says this and it ties in with the point I will be making. ""It's truly incredibly, how feminists believe that you can create gender equality by focusing on the plights of one gender."" That is the entire essence of this movement, and it is a necessity. You could very well change his quote to support slavery and say something like "" It's truly incredible, how slaves believe you can create social equality by focusing on the plights of one race"". The essence behind the feminist movement is equality within itself. It asks for equal treatment among men and women in regards to salary, job positions, and anything else that can fit into this category. The entire directive behind this movement, is that women should be treated and granted the same opportunities as men. This should be a self evident truth. Contention 2 Women compared to Men with Job opportunities. Granted we have made a huge step with this, it was not always the case. My cause is to show how feminism could have helped or will continue to help support this. Since we sunk into recession quite a few years back women are actually starting to outpace men in job hunts. This was not always the case. The Department of Labor has statistics that says this. ""In 2010, women represented 46.7 percent of the United States labor force, a slightly larger share than at the start of the recession in 2007. Overall 71.9 million women were employed or looking for work, representing 58.6 percent of all women aged 16 and over."" then also goes on to say this ""Women surpass men in educational attainment. Among the employed ages 25 and over, 37.1 percent of women have at least a bachelor's degree compared to 34.9 percent of men. Because women are less likely than men to be in the workforce, female college graduates are still outnumbered by male college graduates in the labor force. However, women with a bachelor's degree outnumber men by 1.6 million in the population as a whole and women are a growing share of college graduates. As such, women college graduates are likely to outnumber male college graduates in the labor force in the near future."" This is just recent studies and also mainly after the recession. Now if you look at this data below, we can also see this is clearly supported and men have far more job opportunities than women. Feminism can help keep this in check , and help to assure women have the same rights as men. http://www.dol.gov... Contention 3 Pay-scale Men Vs Women. This is a huge topic and probably one of the main reasons and issues surrounding the feminist movement. While actually receiving the job is a huge deal itself, more often than not women are paid far less than men. This also would make no logical sense due to the fact women have a higher chance of actually finishing a degree than most men(I have shown this through earlier stats and sources). Recent studies show this ""This date symbolizes how far into 2012 the average woman must work to earn what the average man earned in 2011. While the wage gap has certainly narrowed with the past generation of working womenâ€""in 1967 women only earned about 58 cents to a manâ€™s dollarâ€""progress has stalled in recent years. If progress continues at its current rate, it will take 45 years to eradicate the wage gap."" ""In 2010 women who worked full time, year round, still only earned 77 percent of what men earned. The median earnings for women were $36,931 compared to $47,715 for men, and neither real median earnings nor the female-to-male earnings ratio have increased since 2009."" ""The American Association of University Women tackled the pay gap question by looking at workers of the same educational attainmentâ€""same kind of college, same gradesâ€""holding the same kinds of jobs, and having made the same choices about marriage and number of kids. They found that college-educated women earn 5 percent less the first year out of school than their male peers. Ten years later, even if they keep working on par with those men, the women earn 12 percent less."" It is quite obvious through multiple studies and statistics that women make less than men. Also bear in mind that women also have a higher graduation rate from college than men as well. Even with women having the same qualifications as a man, the usually tend to make 10-20 less than if a man were to receive the same job. This is not equality by any means, and is defiantly a reason for the feminist movement to stick up and fight for. http://www.americanprogress.org... http://www.payscale.com... Now for rebuttals. Since I focused more on the social side of this. I am just going to go through some of the points he made and offer rebuttals to what he said directly. This is different than how I normally do this, but to defend feminism I focused more on equality in the work place rather than specifically targeting how women are treated for being women(gender equality) (1A)""I've always been amazed with feminism. While there is an inarguable gender gap, I don't understand how focusing on one gender is supposed to, in anyway, bring out ""equality"". (2A)Well this is pretty self evident, if you don't focus on the issues that a specific ""gender"" is facing, they will never be resolved. Without making an effort to tackle some of the adversities they are facing nothing would change. Especially most of the facts that I mentioned in my contentions. (1B)""While it's true that women in the Middle East are treated absolutely disgusting, the men don't have it all that much better"" (2B)This is just utterly incorrect and a failure to do proper research. Women can be killed or even have their face burned off with battery acid for trying to read. They must also cover their face at all times, due to religious reasons. Men have it far better than women in comparison to middle east standards. (1C)""It's true that being an attractive woman, walking around in a bad area, you could get raped. That's a fear I will always understand. However, if a man finds himself in a bad area wearing the wrong color, he may find himself being the victim of a drive by"" (2C)This is a plausible statement, but it is also statistically shown that women are targeted for crimes far more than men because of their inability to defend themselves. (1D)""Feminists really like to point to double standards that favor men, yet most of these double standards they mention, are in no way true. When is the last time you congratulated a man for sleeping around a lot? My friends and I, always refer to men who sleep around a lot as ""man whores."" That is in no way, a term of endearment"" (2D)Again this could be considered plausible, but fails to address the actual intent behind the movement itself. Thus ruling this point invalid or pointless. (1E)""I find that my issue with feminism is mostly rooted in the fact that they believe women are the victims, because they are women. When a woman is beaten, raped, or has her rights stolen, it's not a feminist issue. It's a humanitarian issue"" (2E)This is defiantly a feminist issue. Where as it could be considered humanitarian in regards to issues like rape, when they are being paid less than men because of what gender they are, there is a proper cause to defend this. The movement itself takes a stand for discrimination they face as a whole, and try to make a level playing field. (1F)""All of my life, I have heard one feminist that I deeply agreed with. I can't seem to remember her name, she was big on YouTube. She managed to speak of women's issues, without blaming men"" (2F)I would imagine that most feminist don't hate men. They may resent them because they are paid more and receive more benefits. This is inevitable if we look at psychology. This would more often than not draw some resentment. I would also venture to say that most women do not feel this way though. They want to tackle the social issues behind this and make a level playing field so they receive equal opportunities, not use the movement as a ""hate on men"" thing. That is why pay grades among women are starting to rise in comparison to men because of the work certain groups have put into resolving this issue. (1G)""That is what gender equality should be about. It should be about looking at the gap between men and women, and asking how we can close that and be as equal as possible"" (2G)Then you support feminism at its core. This almost matches the definition I gave at the beginning and is the driving force behind women's rights. In Closing My adversary has not met his BOP nor shown why feminism is in fact bad. He gave reasons that he dislikes it, but I have shown the movement at its core aims to produce social equality and offer women the same rights as men.

feminism,"I've always been amazed with feminism. While there is an inarguable gender gap, I don't understand how focusing on one gender is supposed to, in anyway, bring out ""equality"". Here are some examples; While it's true that women in the Middle East are treated absolutely disgusting, the men don't have it all that much better. Granted, they aren't being stoned to death for getting pregnant after being raped. However, men that live in a hostile area, are automatically seen as an enemy. So while women are being mistreated, men are being killed. Simply for being a man, in the wrong neighborhood. It's true that being an attractive woman, walking around in a bad area, you could get raped. That's a fear I will always understand. However, if a man finds himself in a bad area wearing the wrong color, he may find himself being the victim of a drive by. Living in a rather... unstable community (to say the least) I have heard stories, and seen first hand how gang violence effects men. I have not seen or heard of any stories of women being victims of this. Feminists really like to point to double standards that favor men, yet most of these double standards they mention, are in no way true. When is the last time you congratulated a man for sleeping around a lot? My friends and I, always refer to men who sleep around a lot as ""man whores."" That is in no way, a term of endearment. It's quite frowned upon actually. Double standards, do however exist. Some that favor men, some that favor women. Domestic violence is a big one. When women are the victims of this, it is taken EXTREMELY seriously. When men are, it's laughed at. Hell, even I have a hard time keeping a straight face when I imagine the man who is getting beaten by his wife. I find that my issue with feminism is mostly rooted in the fact that they believe women are the victims, because they are women. When a woman is beaten, raped, or has her rights stolen, it's not a feminist issue. It's a humanitarian issue. While the feminism your parents grew up with had specific goals and a powerful message, today's is all about throwing sticks and stones at men, and painting absolutely minuscule issues as major problems with society. All of my life, I have heard one feminist that I deeply agreed with. I can't seem to remember her name, she was big on YouTube. She managed to speak of women's issues, without blaming men. But most of all, what she did that truly earned my respect, was her video on the Disposable Man. She actually spoke up for a men's issue. The first time I've heard a feminist, speak of an issue pertaining to having a penis. That is what gender equality should be about. It should be about looking at the gap between men and women, and asking how we can close that and be as equal as possible. While there are genetic factors that make it truly impossible to be completely equal, I feel that society has been going the right way. While feminism does do some good at exposing the sexism against women in advertising and pop culture, it fails to expose the sexism against men. The Damsel in Distress comes to mind. Her videos on sexism in video games was intriguing. She made a good point when she said that women are always painted as the one's in need of help. However, she didn't point out the fact that it's always MEN who are painted as the one's who are expected to sacrifice themselves to save a woman. It's truly incredibly, how feminists believe that you can create gender equality by focusing on the plights of one gender.",CON,"I've always been amazed with feminism.

Which sounds great and all but modern day feminism, in my opinion, is just something used to give women an advantage and antagonize men. When I ask most modern feminist, ""name one thing a male can do but you can't"" they can't say anything because there really isn't. (At least in the U.S.) If anything men have a disadvantage nowadays. I will list a few -Men pay 97% of Alimony -Men lose custody in 84% of divorces. -77% of homicide victims are men. -89% of men will be the victim of at least one violent crime. -Men are over twice as victimised by strangers as women. -Men are 165% more likely to be convicted than women. -Men get 63% longer sentences than women for the same crime. -Court bias against men is at least 6 times bigger than racial bias. -Males are discriminated against in school and University. -Boys face vastly more corporal punishment than girls. -60-80% of the homeless are men. -At least 10% of fathers are victims of paternity fraud. -One-third of all fathers in the USA have lost custody of children, most are expected to pay for this. -40-70% of domestic violence is against men, however, less than 1% of domestic violence shelter spaces are for men. -Men pay over 70% of income tax but the vast majority of public spending is on services for women All these statements come from a website called http://www.realsexism.com... . This website compiles all sources from various places which support each of my examples. I have looked through all of them myself. For example in my first example about alimony, the U.S. census bureau found that only 3% of men received alimony in 2010. Now if you ask me that sounds like an awful amount of disturbing disadvantages. Which you don't hear feminists talk about or protest about. But what you do hear is them talking about the wage gap. Which has actually been debunked, I could explain later if you want. So my point is that modern-day feminism is just a load of bull. As all they focus on is benefiting women.

feminism,"Thanks Pro for the timely response. Definition Problems There is a problem with Pro's definition of ""requisite""... it defines ""requisite"" as a noun, while the word ""necessary"" is used as an adjective in the debate resolution. We know this because when one diagrams the sentence ""Feminism is necessary"", the word ""necessary"" describes ""feminism"" and is therefore an adjective.[3] With this in mind, Pro's definition of a noun isn't interchangeable with the adjective ""necessary"". In other words, Pro's argument concerning the definition of ""necessary"" should be disregarded. Logical Fallacy Pro has engaged in a logical fallacy known as ""Moving the Goalposts"". I doubt if she did it on purpose, but regardless of her motivation, her argument should be disregarded nonetheless. Let me explain: Moving the goalposts: ""Moving the goalposts, similar to ""shifting sands"" and also known as raising the bar, is an informal fallacy in which evidence presented in response to a specific claim is dismissed and some other (often greater) evidence is demanded. That is, after an attempt has been made to score a goal, the goalposts are moved to exclude the attempt. The problem with changing the rules of the game is that the meaning of the end result is changed, too."" [4] Basically, once I showed feminism is NOT necessary, Pro tried to change the resolution from Feminism is Necessary to ""Feminism is Necessary for the achievement of a specific end"". That's unfair. If Pro wanted to debate that, she should have said so before I accepted the debate. It's too late to change the debate now, so I ask the voters to ignore her attempt to do so.

feminism,"I would like to thank my opponent for her opening arguments. At this time, since it wasn't defined in the first or second round by my opponent, I would like to offer a definition of the word ""necessary"". Necessary: being essential, indispensable, or requisite [1] This is a common definition, so I presume Pro will have no problem with it. Now for a little history of feminism: ""Charles Fourier, a Utopian Socialist and French philosopher, is credited with having coined the word ""f""minisme"" in 1837.[10] The words ""f""minisme"" (""feminisme"") and ""f""minist"" (""feminist"") first appeared in France and the Netherlands in 1872,[11] Great Britain in the 1890s, and the United States in 1910,[12][13] and the Oxford English Dictionary lists 1852 as the year of the first appearance of ""feminist""[14] and 1895 for ""feminism"".[15]"" [2] So, with this in mind, I think I can address all of my opponent's arguments with one general rebuttal: Since there was once a time when feminism didn't exist, it's clearly not necessary. It's not essential for our survival, nor is it indispensable, or a requisite. Feminism may or may not be a good thing to have, but it's NOT necessary. We have lived without it in the past, and could do so in the future. Remember, we're NOT debating if we SHOULD practice feminism. The debate resolution is about whether it's necessary. Treating women as equals is a nice thing to do, but it's not NECESSARY. I turn it back over to Pro.

feminism,"First off I""d like to say thank you for accepting my debate challenge, much thanks. To start off with my argument you put the definition of feminism as ""The advocacy of women's rights on the ground of the equality of the sexes"". Now let me show you the definition of another group of people looking for equality. ""A political theory derived from Karl Marx, advocating class war and leading to a society in which all property is publicly owned and each person works and is paid according to their abilities and needs."" now guess what this is defining. Thats right Communism. Its sounds good on paper but that's not what they do. They oppress and murder anyone who doesn""t agree with them. The same thing is happening with Feminism. In the 19th and early 20th century feminism focused on It focused on legal issues, primarily on gaining women's suffrage. Second wave feminism in the early 1960s focused on sexuality, family, the workplace, reproductive rights, de facto inequalities, and official legal inequalities. Third and fourth wave focused on stereotypes and media portrayals of women. Fast forward to 2015 we have all those things(we might be still working on the fourth wave but that's almost over). Women have equal rights and actualy I say they have more than men. Women are more privileged than man so the fact that modern day Feminism still exist comes off as a joke because it is.

feminism,"First of all, you compared feminism and communism, two completely different ideologies, saying that 'the same thing is happening with feminism' as communism. I would like to point out that in feminism no one is getting 'oppressed' or 'murdered' for not agreeing, the thing that is happening is woman's rights are being attained. For example, as you mentioned, the fight for the vote in the 19th and 20th century, getting rid of legal inequalities in the 1960s and getting rid of stereotypes till this very day. You also argued that women are actually more privileged than men, using several opinionated sources. These sources said stuff like 'I can produce offspring. A status which grants me an “essential” status in our species that men can never have and which can never be taken away from me even in old age.' This is a load of rubbish, I mean, it takes two people to make a baby, hence the male and female are both 'essential'. Also, I would like to point out that the vast majority of woman are paid less than men in the same job, some employers won't hire women in case they become pregnant and have to take maternity leave and there are still a large range of stereotypes against women. These are really important problems that need to be sorted out. Lastly, you said at the start you don't think feminism is necessary.

feminism,"Hi. I will be arguing that feminism is way past the point of equality. Now don't get me wrong. I believe both men and women deserve equal rights and oppertunities in this world, but I think feminism has gone a little bit too far nowadays. I think the some extreme radical femisists are no longer aiming for equality. They are aiming to eradicate all forms of male power and put women on top which is total hypocrisy. If you're fighting for equality, you would fight to say that men are permitted to keep their power in government and in the workforce as well as women. But on the other hand, I cannot deny that there are feminists who actually do fight for equality. I am not attacking all feminists because I know there are some well meaning ones out there and I appreciate that they are trying to battle the inequalities women AND men nowadays. But I just don't think there is any need for feminism anymore. It started back when women had very little working rights and were only seen as housewives and mothers and obviously they wanted more than just that. But nowadays, women have the choice to stay at home or work. What need is there for feminism? The point is that feminism has gone past the point of acheiving equal rights for men and women. It is now about obtaining female supremacy over men which is totally wrong just as male supremacy over women is totally wrong.

feminism,"Excellent, thank you for accepting the debate. I agree with your definitions. Humanism is a social construct. It was crafted during the Renaissance as a social construct, a new one made following the medieval ages by the people post dark ages. Humanism only has its meaning because we gave it its meaning just like Feminism was given its meaning. Well, no, I don't believe that Feminism is the belief that women should dominate men. I agree with your definition of it absolutely. By the way, if the reader would like to know, I usually discuss paragraph by paragraph of the opponent, so that is how you can know the pattern. Nice and simple. Yes it was. There is a lot of debates out there as to this. I personally sit on the fence about this issue, and, as a humanist, I always say ""Well hey, Humanism addresses the issues of both men and women economically. Why focus on one when we can focus on all groups plights? Females aren't the only discriminated ones, each and every group of people has their own discrimination they face. Why not help it all? Women aren't the only ones who are prejudiced against."" Now this is an issue I kind of don't sit on the fence about. Yes, it is a stereotype of females that is and isn't followed depending on each individual person. But, for example, men are expected to be strong, emotionless, logical, physically competent, large, handsome and confident. African Americans are expected to be tall, athletic, ghetto, aggressive. Americans are seen as fat, lazy, prideful, greedy, stupid, always partying and being crude. Russians are seen as always drinking whiskey. You see, every group faces their own prejudices. A man that decides to wear more feminine articles of clothing is considered a tom-girl and thus un-masculine. Men have been essentially placed into a box of expectations- You see where I am getting at. You may think this doesn't have much to do with the debate, but it shows how it in fact is. I am saying that each and every group faces their own prejudices. Feminism covers one group. Humanism covers them all. Equality for all. By the way, I open doors for men and women equally. Does that make me a misogynist and a sexist at the same time? I feel it is rather tedious to use the same argument as my last paragraph, but men are met with similar expectations. You probably know the examples I am going to give out, the exact opposite of yours, so I won't much bother. In fact, as I read through this I believe you fail to acknowledge that men are met with several of their own expectations in regards to sexual activities. If you want examples feel free to ask. I agree that feminism is not women hating on men and trying to be dominant, I agree fully with your definition. The thing is, I believe that Humanism is simply better then Feminism. Also, may I mention that individuals still make up part of it. It may be a tumor to feminism metaphorically to you. So, if that is the case, then I would suggest then ""Feminism as a whole"" go and attempt to have some internal debates as well. Extreme feminists, as I mentioned seem to have no one objecting to their words within the system of Feminism. Also, have you ever met an extremist humanist? I sure haven't.

feminism,"Hello there, today I will be telling you why Feminism is cancer. -Most of the people who are involved in feminism, are feminazi. Meaning that they want superiority over men rather than equality. The amount of feminazis there are VASTLY outnumber the amount of actual feminist there are. Besides, in america and all other decent countries that are civilized, there is not much to be done about equality between the two because for the most part, everything is equal between men and women. Other in the middle east women getting stoned to death because of genital mutilation. Now that's a SERIOUS issue. But, it hardly seems like the ""feminist"" actually care about it. - I also just wanted to clarify that I'm not saying that all feminist are horrible. I'm just saying that there are a lot of feminist who are. -I would also like to suggest one thing to the con, maybe instead of feminism, we do egalitarianism. Egalitarianism is supporting that EVERYONE is equal and deserves the same rights. But feminism only includes men and women. This means you can have a racist feminist but you can't have a sexist egalitarian. Also there is no loophole that can actually make egalitarianism bad like feminism. - One thing I'm predicting that the con may bring up is the gender pay gap. But this has been proven false on many occasions. Here are some examples http://www.forbes.com...... http://www.washingtonexaminer.com...... - I would also like to add( if it hasn't already been added) is that if woman have been getting payed less than men, than wouldn't the companies that were doing this get sued because of the equal pay act passed on in 1963? -There are a lot of feminist who complain about a lot of things about somehow being sexist. In this video that I'm about to show you, we're going to have a feminist who is complaining about why toys are sexist. Here's the link. https://www.youtube.com...... Ok so here are some of the points this person is trying to make in the video -She's complaining on how whenever she goes to the girls section, there's all of these pink everywhere and a bunch of barbies and dolls. But whenever she goes to the boy section, there a bunch of monster trucks, cars, and action figures. She's saying that she hates the ""girly"" thinks and that the world is telling girls that you have to like this and boys you have to like that. Well first of all, the reason that there is so much pink and so many dolls is that because the majority of girls like those. People wouldn't be selling stuff that they don't like. Same with the boys, the majority of boys like those cars and monster trucks. But there are some boys who like dolls and there are some girls who like cars. I understand that. Some of my best friends who are boys like the color pink and some of my girl best friends like to play sports and video games. -Another thing feminist might want to complain about is how woman receive so much abuse and pain from men. When actually, it's the men that receive more abuse. Statistics show that other than rape, men have a higher chance of being affected by any other crime. http://nortonbooks.typepad.com...... - Imagine a very amazing, nicely polished, expensive, and large house. That house can represent old feminism. Now imagine that same house but with a HUGE amount of termites in it. Those termites represent the average feminist. Now imagine pest control, those are the good feminist. The pest control is trying to save the house, both it can't. The termites are to strong. There's no saving the house. The house now looks very worn down and ugly. That's modern feminism. There are too many radical feminist to be able to restore feminism to want it once was. That's why, in the end, it's better to just burn the house.

feminism,"Thank you for submitting your Round 3 arguments. Rebuttals CON's objection to my Maxim is hardly an objection at all. Simply finding something worth ignoring does not mean it should be ignored, especially considering no official alternative has been offered. That is to say, that CON has not provided us with a relevant maxim by which to decide who's points are stronger. Simply because men and women are currently equal in most places does not then mean the Maxim is worth ignoring. Perhaps there is some other Maxim that could have been offered. However, my definitions stand. As such, when casting your vote, do pay attention to how the arguments are made as relates to the Maxim provided. CON then begins addressing my point regarding his conflation of a group of people with the ideology/philosophy that they adhere to. The reasoning CON offers for believing that feminism is negative is fallacious. This is similar to arguing that since there have been bad Christians (for example, those of the Spanish Inquisition or the Westboro Baptist church) that therefore Christianity is negative, that is, has a negative effect on society due to failure to achieve a certain maxim. Simply because there are some people who are bad within a group does not then mean the entire group is bad. While I will not assert that feminism is detached from its adherents, it seems, to me, quite absurd to look at only one specific subset of a group to render a decision. ""Feminism"" is the ""advocacy of women's rights on the ground of equality of the sexes"". That means that we must look at those circumstances wherein this advocacy takes place. CON's points in regards to the supposed Wage Gap are of very little strength. There was a time when it was determined that an Act must be passed for the achievement of the Maxim. The Equal Pay Act of 1963 (EPA-63) was meant to ensure that no one was paid unfairly based on race or gender [1]. The EPA-63 is still in effect. Whether or not the Act was necessary (as it can be argued it wasn't), the maxim is still being acheived. All people are to be paid the same amount if they are of the same labor value. That is to say, that if a man and woman have the same level of experience, education, and dedication, their income should be equal, provided they are under the same employee for the same length of time. CON, once again, attempts to ease the burden of proof that must be satisfied. The resolution states ""Feminism: positive or negative"" not ""Radical Feminism: positive or negative"". This is, again, related to the Fallacy of Composition. Even if radical feminism is negative, this is one sect of feminism. This is an invalid argument. It can be summarized as follows: Radical feminism is a part of feminism as a whole. Radical feminism is bad (assumption). Therefore, Feminism as a whole is bad. Even if it were summarized as a Modus Ponens: If radical feminism is bad, then feminism as a whole is bad. Radical feminism is bad (assumption). Therefore, feminism as a whole is bad. The conclusion could still be false, given new information, thus making the argument unsound, and removing the warrant it would provide. For example, the fact that ""feminism"" is the name given to the actions that lead to women being able to vote, getting paid as they should, being able to sue and be sued, being able to own property, and having their own legal identities. These facts demand a reconsideration of reasons to believe feminism is negative. CON did not address any of these points. They still stand. Conclusion As stated earlier, my definitions stand unchallenged. The Maxim also stands unchallenged. As such, they are the official guidelines for voting on this debate. My argument goes as follows: 1. X is positive if and only if X benefits society such that if X were not in effect/existence/practice, there would be some maxim that is not achieved. (definition offered in R1) 2. The Maxim is ""All people, regardless of gender, race, age, sexuality, should be held equal under law"". 3. If feminism were not practiced, women would not be legally equal to men (supported by arguments from EPA-63 and Coverture and definition). 4. From 4, without feminism, the Maxim cannot be attained. C. From 1 and 5, feminism is positive. While I agree with some of CON's commentary on the modern iteration of feminism, this does not count as an affirmation of the CON resolution. Feminists are not feminism, articles are not advocacy, and radical feminism is not the entirety of the feminist movement. There are somethings that have been done in the feminist movement that, were they mentioned, would affirm the CON resolution. However, these things were not mentioned. I have provided sufficient warrant for my position. The summary above is what was intended to be taken away from my arguments. I look for to the votes and any feedback that is offered.

abortion,"Abortion is the ending of pregnancy by the removal or forcing out from the womb of a fetus or embryo before it is able to survive on its own. An abortion can occur spontaneously, in which case it is often called a miscarriage. It can also be purposely caused in which case it is known as an induced abortion. The term abortion most commonly refers to the induced abortion of a human pregnancy. The similar procedure after the fetus may be able to survive on its own is medically known as a late termination of pregnancy. There are two kinds of abortion in the U.S. "" in-clinic abortion and the abortion pill. Abortions are very common. In fact, 3 out of 10 women in the U.S. have an abortion by the time they are 45 years old. If you are pregnant, you have options. If you are trying to decide if abortion is the right choice for you, you probably have many things to think about. Learning the facts about abortion may help you in making your decision. You may also want to learn more about parenting and adoption. If you are under 18, your state may require one or both of your parents to give permission for your abortion or be told of your decision prior to the abortion. However, in most states you can ask a judge to excuse you from these requirements. Learn more about parental consent for abortion. Only you can decide what is best for you. But we are here to help. A staff member at your local Planned Parenthood health center can discuss abortion and all of your options with you and help you find the services you need. The debate over whether or not abortion should be a legal option continues to divide Americans. The abortion debate is the ongoing controversy surrounding the moral and legal status of abortion. The two main groups involved in the abortion debate are the self-described ""pro-choice"" movement (emphasizing the right of women to choose whether to abort a pregnancy or to grow it to term) and the self-described ""pro-life"" movement (emphasizing the right of the embryo or fetus to gestate and be born). Both of these ascriptions are considered loaded terms in mainstream media where terms such as ""abortion rights"" or ""anti-abortion"" are generally preferred. Each movement has, with varying results, sought to influence public opinion and to attain legal support for its position, with small numbers of anti-abortion advocates sometimes using violence.

An abortion can occur spontaneously, in which case it is often called amiscarriage, or it can be purposelyinduced. The term abortion most commonly refers to the induced abortion of a human pregnancy.

Now that we all know what abortion is, I would like to bring up that Abortion is a right in many countries. Almost every country in the world have abortion that is legal to a degree. Often countries allow abortions only in special cases, like rape, fetal defects and maternal health. Only 6 countries refuse to give abortions under any circumstance. However, many countries allow abortions for any reason. “The landmark abortion case Roe v. Wade, decided on Jan. 22, 1973 in favor of abortion rights, remains the law of the land. The 7-2 decision stated that the Constitution gives ‘a guarantee of certain areas or zones of privacy,’ and that ‘This right of privacy... is broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.’ ” Abortion in many countries is considered a civil right and taking away a right is not a good thing. Why? Simple. Discrimination. Anti-Abortion laws discriminate against rape-victims. Not only is it unfair to the mother but it is also unfair to the child.

abortion,"Thank you, Pro. Negative Case A1: False equivalence In the first round, in order to clarify the single word ""abortion"" into a resolution, my opponent elaborates: ""if abortion is murder, so is abstinence. Having an abortion is the equivalent of not getting pregnant in the first place"". Now, there is are obvious differences between abortion and not getting pregnant. I. There is no child in not getting pregnant, yet there is a child involved with an abortion. II. There is no child death involved in not getting pregnant, yet there is always child death with abortion. It follows that ""having an abortion is the equivalent of not getting pregnant in the first place"" is contradictory. Hence, my opponent's resolution falls under the logical fallacy classification of false equivalence [1]. Counter-arguments ""Note: My firs round was not meant to be taken literally, I just thought it did a fairly good job of summing up my point. A fetus in the first few months is not mentally developed, and to abort it is the equivalent of not getting pregnant in the first place. I am not debating at what point it is developed; it is a gray area."" My opponent has attempted to shift the goalposts here, which is logically fallacious [2]. How this occurred is that opponent originally clarified the resolution to be about a debate on ""having an abortion is the equivalen[ce] of not getting pregnant in the first place"", but now he/she has lessened this burden of proof by claiming that the resolution had to be taken non-literally. Unfortunately for my opponent, no such further clarification was presented in the first round: ""If abortion is murder, so is abstinence. Having an abortion is the equivalent of not getting pregnant in the first place."" Within these two sentences, you will find nothing that dictates this debate requires a non-literal interpretation of the resolution. Therefore, the resolution is not set to be taken non-literally, and thus my interpretation remains legitimate in this debate. ""The last two months is not okay to abort, first three months it is. The middle is fairly circumstantial. I am arguing for the right to have an abortion, not whether it is ok to abort a seven month developed child. This post was more of an introductory round, not a main argument."" My opponent concedes the debate with this argument, even if the resolution were to be taken non-literally. You see, my opponent argues that abortion is not a singular colour, in regards to metaphysical ethics/morals (i.e. not being ""okay"" to abort during the last two months). In other words, it would be okay to abort in the first three months, BUT abortion, according to Pro, is the same as not getting pregnant! What this means is that: 1) Abortion is proposed as a singular type 2) However, according to my opponent, there is a difference in the morality/ethics of abortion, varying based on the time of incubation (meaning that there are two types of abortion) 3) Not getting pregnant is a singular type 4) My opponent judged that abortion is (ethically/morally) the equivalent not getting pregnant in the first place, despite there being black-and-white differences (i.e. singular term) in regards to the abortion in question C) Therefore, my opponent has to keep the morality/ethics of abortion either wrong or ""okay"" (due to the construction of the resolution requiring abortion to equal not getting pregnant), yet my opponent has argued that the ethics/morality of abortion varies! Thus, abortion is not always the equivalent of not getting pregnant. Conclusion Via a legitimate interpretation of the resolution, I have shown that there are literal differences between abortion and not getting pregnant, thereby negating the resolution. Later, even though I am not required to do so, I showed how my opponent's argument concedes the debate, even if I were to allow the shifting of goalposts to a strictly non-literal interpretation.

Partial Birth Abortions In which the fetus, nearly fully formed, is destroyed during induced labor. At this point in time, the mother might as well wait until full term and give it up for adoption as the already blurry line of morality in abortion becomes even blurrier. 2. Spontaneous Abortions In which a woman with an implanted fetus loses the fetus accidentally, commonly known as a miscarriage. This should be avoided because for the most part, women who miscarry actually wanted the child. 3. Abortions inflicted on unwilling people There is something inherently immoral in the act of walking up to a pregnant woman and kicking in her stomach such that she miscarries. Though this is a form of abortion, I argue that it should in no way be supported. 4. Dangerous abortions I am against many forms of abortion for health reasons. The use of coat hangers to stimulate an abortion, for example. Or throwing oneself off a flight of stairs. Or going to a back-alley abortionist that doubles as a tattoo parlor.

abortion,"This should be fun :) The legalisation of abortion has been a big issue worldwide for a long period of time, not only politically but also on social and religious fronts. Abortion can be defined, as by the Merriam-Webster Dictionary as the termination of a pregnancy resulting in the death of the embryo or fetus. The reasons for and against are both numerous and persuasive. The first reason that deems that abortion should be illegal is due to the fact that abortion is considered immoral. Considering that life begins as soon as the fetus is created, the killing of a fetus could be considered the killing of a human. In this way abortion is similar to murder. If it is immoral to kill a human, how could it be considered acceptable to terminate a fetus? No civilized society allows one human to intentionally take the life of another human freely, and according to the aforementioned definition, abortion should not be different. Abortion also goes against the Hippocratic Oath. The Hippocratic Oath is historically taken by doctors and nurses that swear to practice medicine ethically. One of the lines in the classic Hippocratic Oath states that ‘I will give no deadly medicine to any one if asked, nor suggest any such counsel; and similarly I will not give a woman a pessary to cause an abortion'. This clearly states that abortion goes against the ethics of medicine and medicinal science. Another reason that abortion should be illegal is due to the fact that there is no such thing as an unwanted child. One of the main reasons for abortion is that the parents are unable to keep the child. However, the genetic parents do not necessarily need to keep the child, but they could rather put the child up for adoption. This option is preferable to killing a human being. Is adoption not a better way of dealing with the issue? Abortion can also lead to medical problems in later life. 10% of women that go through with abortion have immediate complications. This does not include those that have other medical problems later in life due to abortion. These medical issues include, but are certainly not limited to, cervical, ovarian and liver cancers, uterine perforation, cervical laceration, placenta previa, complications with future births, handicapped newborns, eptopic pregnancy, pelvic inflammatory disease and lower general health. The risk is intensified for multiple abortions. Despite all the compelling reasons against the legalisation of abortion there are several reasons that abortion is positive. Firstly, on many occasions the parents are unfit or unable to take care of the baby. The reasons for this could be due to several factors, including religious, moral or financial complication. If a woman does become pregnant, it is extremely likely to be an accidental birth, in which a contraceptive has failed, bad planning or due to rape. In any of these scenarios abortion is often the only option. One of the main reasons against abortion is that the killing of a fetus is considered murder, akin to the killing of another human being. However, there is a difference between the concept of personhood and the concept of human life. Almost all abortions take place in very early stages of pregnancy. In these early phases, the fetus can not live outside the mother's womb. In this case, can the fetus be classified as a separate being? The question is up to the mother to decide, and what she wishes to do with the child. Once again, the classification, or definition of what is considered human depends on the individual and their beliefs. Another reason for abortion is the complications of how pregnancy, and a child, would affect a young person's life. If forced to continue with the birth of the child, the prospects for the parents would be rather grim. They would be extremely likely to have to leave school, rely on society for raising their child, develop health problems, end up separating or have psychological problems like depression or anxiety. Abortion is often the only way that parents can avoid this bleak future. One reason for the legalisation of abortion is that if abortion became illegal, it would lead to a lot of ‘backstreet' abortions. These abortions would cost a lot of money, be unsafe and unclean, and have generally negative effects on the mother. However, if abortion were to remain legal, then abortions can be carried out in safe and clean environments, where the prime concern is welfare rather than money. Another reason that abortion should be legal is due to the fact that if the child would be born with defects, whether the deficiencies be physical, mental or a combination, it would lead to problems. Having a child with severe medical problems would not only be detrimental to the child but also to the mother and father. The parents may have problems against having a child with birth problems, not only in raising the child, but also due to how they feel, whether this is owing to social or religious demands. In this case abortion can be the only way to deal with the issue. Approximately, there are 42 million abortions that happen every year. The amount that are justified is uncertain, and certainly depends on the individual's definition of the word. But the question remains, should abortion remain legal? What do you think? Personally I believe that abortion should have certain requirements that must be fulfilled before abortion is applicable to the mother. Some requirements may be if it was a forced pregnancy, if it was due to a contraceptive failing or if harm could come to the mother from the birth of the child. In this way, abortion would become less of a contraceptive or an easy way out, but more of a positive thing that would be extremely helpful to many people internationally.

abortion,"Although I oppose abortion in most cases, I accepted this debate because Con's position is that abortion ""can never be justified regardless of circumstances."" That is the point I want to disagree with. I don't think anything Con said substantiates his position. He argues that abortion is not justified to avoid hardship, or deal with problems like low self-esteem, sexual exploitation, promiscuity, poverty, lack of education, and absense of moral guidence. I agree with all that. But those do not exhaust the circumstances under which a person might get an abortion; therefore, they do not show that abortion ""can never be justified regardless of the circumstances."" The one circumstance in which I think abortion is morally justified is in cases where the pregnancy puts the mother's life at risk. Abortion is justified in these cases for two reasons. First, it's justified because people have the right to preserve their own lives. Second, it's justified because if a pregnant woman dies, then so does her unborn, and it's better to save one life than to lose two.

abortion,"First of all, I put my sources in the Comments section right after I posted arguments since I absolutely forgot to put them in my case. I also gave the Bibliography because I did use books. So let me tell you why I wasn't able to make it those rounds. Give my opponent a conduct point for me forfeiting a rounds. The story is I went to a sleepover and some very unfortunate things happened to me. Anyways, I'll try to give a reply. Please excuse my forfeit and I ask my audience to base their focus on arguments instead of conduct. 1. An abortion is a fundamental right for a woman. I think you misunderstand what I meant. I didn't mean that the part about Roe vs. Wade confirming it correct was my argument. I just meant to confirm that it is legally a human right. This was my actual argument: ""A woman has the right of an abortion because it her body. Her body is her right. An embyro and/or fetus in a body is technically still her property. She can do what she wants with her property."" Being pregnant means that the embyro/fetus is in your body which means it is your property. Thus an abortion is a fundamental right for a woman because it is her property. 2. Abortions reduce injury and death. I meant that without legalizing abortion, there will be homemade abortion which would hurt more people. With legalized abortion, there are less deaths for the person having the abortion and there are less injury with abortion legalized. I don't get how doing something illegal is that person's problem. If someone came out and got his machine gun to kill a bunch of people, would it ""be your problem""? Just like murder, abortion hurts others. 3. Abortion stances are usually religious. A pro-life stance based on religion should not be upheld in our laws due to the violation of church and state separation. Since the majority of abortion stances are based on religion, abortion should not be legalized based on someone's religious beliefs. They can believe that abortion is murder, they just can't legalize abortion based on their religious beliefs. Um, the government in the Separation of Church and State states religion isn't the basis of our laws. 4. Modern abortion procedures are safe. 1st, the safety of abortion provides an alternative to homemade abortions which cause less safety for the mothers. 2nd of all, all my sources are in the Comments section. 3rd of all, you're math is bad. Let's say how many deaths are in 1 billion people? 133,000! That's a lot of women dying. How about our safe medical procedures? 10,000 deaths. Our safe medical procedure just saved 123,000 lives which help much more. 0.13% for unsafe homemade procedures with 0.00001% for safe mechanical procedures. Thus, legal abortion saves lives. 5. Abortion gives option. No, it's better for the parent to decide if they are able to take care of a mentally deficient child. Giving option is better than forcing someone to make the decision. It's not about the right to sentence someone to life, it's about the parents' freedom to. We are arguing about the freedom that parents have when they have no money to get machines and features. 6. Abortion reduces crime. Many of the ""criminals"" are doing their action to get food for their children when they have no economic capability. That's why they do crimes. The choice to have an abortion means they can reach economic stability. 7. A baby should not come into this world unwanted. You still never explained why a baby should come into this world unwanted. Rebuttal: 8. Abortion is murder. Fetuses are not biologically proven to be humans. Until they are, the removing or expelling of an embyro or fetus is not human. They are not humans because it has not been proven that they have a personality or a character. Thus it is not murder. 9. There are options. I have 3 points which will destroy our entire contention. 1st of all, an embyro/fetus is not a human. 2nd of all, there are many alternatives to abortion but their is still abortion as an option. 3rd of all, taking away the option of abortion is just like banning adoption and one of the alternatives. Thus, abortion is one of those abortions. 10. What if you were aborted? If I were aborted, I wouldn't have known I existed. This is irrelevant. 11. The mother should not be in control of the baby's life. 1st of all, it's not a baby. It's not a child. It's an embyro or fetus. Thus, it's the woman's property. The fetus or embyro is not a child. It is the property of the mother. Thus, the the mother has the control of her own property. 12. Late term abortion. We are not arguing about late term abortion. We are arguing about abortion. 13.

abortion,"I thank my opponent for his response to my previous statement. ""Whether or not abortion can also be classified as assault is irrelevant to this debate"" (I argue this statement) As a matter of fact it is relevant to this debate. The topic we are discussing is abortion and whether it should be accepted or not. Clearly anyone who is kicked in the stomach has witnessed an act of assault. Abortion is only abortion if it is considered to be or not to be by the child carrier. If not considered abortion, it is only a mere act of assault. This can happen to anyone. I now argue my opponent's ideology of the ""morning after pill"". Referring back to my opponent's definition of abortion, the morning after pill is also another form of abortion. It all eliminates the infant correct? Therefore, my opponent provided another form of abortion that he stated is the solution to pregnancy even though he is supposed to argue against it. Any act of the mother eliminating her child would be classified as abortion only if it is intended by the carrier. Immorality: No, I was not intending it to fall under my opponent's four categories. I was only preventing that from being argued. It may not be relevant to the four types of abortion, but it is relevant to the topic at hand. what is right and wrong?: The people in this world have their own basic concept of what is right or wrong. This can also relate to morality. Every single person shares the same individual mindset, their own gathered ideas and opinions of what is right and wrong. I extend my argument referring to morality with only the slightest question...What is moral in this world? Certainly not shaving. This refers to the Bible. It is absolutely hypocritical for someone who shaves to say abortion is immoral. In addition to my opponent's remark about whether kicking a woman in the stomach is moral or not. Assault is not moral. But then again we are not talking about assault, we are talking about abortion. Why I did not respond to the other three categories of abortion, well that is the thing....I actually did in a general remark. Referring to my previous statements about morality, intentional abortion and teen pregnancy. I extend my previous arguments.....

abortion,"""This is a tough point to make on your end. There are serious differences between countries that you are ignoring that would contribute to the differences in abortion practices like culture, Societal feelings, Access to healthcare/contraceptives, Education, To name a few. "" Almost half of the 56million abortions in the world each year are unsafe and generally illegal. As a result, At least 22, 800women die every year and 7 million are admitted to hospitals with complications. About 8%of maternal mortality is due to unsafe abortion. Abortion laws are not only harmful to women""s health, They are generally unworkable or onerous. Even seemingly minor restrictions violate the rights of pregnant people, Interfere with medical discretion, And compromise the quality of care. Since the laws were not written with women""s health in mind, Healthcare professionals are often put in the position of skirting the law in order to do their jobs of saving peoples' lives and health. The sheer range and inconsistency of abortion laws around the world proves they are unrelated to good healthcare, And are politically motivated. This helps explain why developed countries like Canada enjoy very low maternal mortality rates from abortion, While the most obscenely high mortality rates occur in African countries where abortion is totally banned. Of course, Healthcare services are usually superior and more accessible in developed countries, But it's clear that anti-abortion laws kill women, While repealing the laws saves their lives. Having no abortion restrictions also helps to integrate abortion care into the healthcare system, Facilitate early access, And improve women""s health in general. The nature of the fetus and its moral status is EXACTLY the point. The moral value of a fetus is a matter of personal opinion? I disagree. Well that's your opinion and the point is, ""should abortion be illegal"" Taking away one person's right for an other is morally wrong. So just because it's law and has been ""firmly established"" for years doesn't make it right. It does not make it right, It makes it legal. The very point of the argument. . . Which facts have I confused exactly? The fact that laws do not reduce abortion. A comprehensive sex education, Readily available access to free birth control and a free and comprehensive support and health care system. America offers little and always at a cost, Punishing the poorest and the weakest shunning and shaming single teens mothers, Charging 30k for deliveries. It""s ironic that abortion laws are designed to limit abortions, Yet one of the best ways to reduce abortion is to liberalize or repeal anti-abortion laws. That""s not the only factor of course. The real key is to promote women""s rights, With particular attention to their reproductive rights. Most abortions occur because people can""t afford to have a child, So governments can significantly reduce abortion numbers by building a more stable, Prosperous society and making child-rearing economically feasible. There is no need for societies to defend fetal interests directly, As the best way to protect fetuses is to provide resources directly to pregnant people. When a pregnant woman is safe and healthy, So is her fetus. The abortion debate will probably never be resolved on a philosophical level, Because the anti-choice movement is strongly motivated by religious ideology. Their fixation on the fetus, With their foregone conclusion that fetuses are full human beings with rights, Cancels out any competing claim for women""s rights. Underlying all the pro-fetus rhetoric is the unquestioned assumption that women were made to have babies, This is their God-given natural role, And the law must enforce that. A logical extension of this view is that any woman who has an abortion must be a victim of coercion, Or too ignorant or desperate to understand what she""s doing.

abortion,"Many different procedures exist to carry out the process of abortion. According to Birth Mothers (an organization working to help women with unwanted pregnancies), one of the most commonly used types of abortion is a saline abortion. In a saline abortion, amniotic fluid is removed from the woman and replaced by a strong saline (salt) solution. As the fetus""s lungs absorb the salt solution, it begins to suffocate. It may struggle and may even have convulsions. The saline also burns off the fetus"" outer layer of skin. Saline abortion can take one to six hours before the fetus is no longer viable. According to Life Site News, 1,200 babies survive abortions each year. About 50% of them die before the age of 12. For those who do not die, mostly all of them have a disability or lifelong impairment. This act is cruel to those babies who survive the abortion. According to Minnesota Citizens Concerned for Life (an pro-life organization), babies can feel pain from abortion. Neonatologists and nurses are able to see unborn babies at 20 weeks gestation react physically to outside stimuli such as sound, light and touch. The sense of touch is so acute that even a single human hair drawn across an unborn baby's palm causes the baby to make a fist. This clearly proves that a baby can feel pain from abortion. Sadness surfaces when thinking of this fact. Cruelty is a word used in many different scenarios, most often used when discussing murder. Abortion is murder; therefore, abortion cruel. What is a woman thinking when she is deciding to have an abortion? Did she think, before sexual intercourse, about the possibility that she may get pregnant? According to Operation Rescue, 87% of women who have had an abortion admitted that they were thinking only of their pleasure when they were not using proper protection or birth control during sexual intercourse. Most women who have abortions are killing an innocent life to fix their mistakes. Other cases exist for example rape or possible disease.

abortion,"Hello, I am arguing for the idea of abortion. I think that abortion is perfectly in line with secular ethics and beliefs. The reason why I particularly mention ""secular"" ethics is because there are many people who do not agree with abortion because it goes against the religious beliefs they have. One popular belief is that abortion is unethical because it goes against one of the Ten Commandments of the Christian faith, ""Thou shalt not kill."" However, I think that abortion is undoubtedly harmonious with the popular Christian opinion. First of all, an abortion is sometimes performed as a NECESSARY surgical procedure. The abortion of a fetus is sometimes the only way a life-threatening pregnancy can be terminated. For instance, during an ectopic pregnancy, fertilization occurs outside of the uterus, usually in a Fallopian Tube. If the blastocyst (fertilized egg) continues to develop, it is bound to be life threatening for the mother. Usually the only solution to this is an abortion. In the case that I have presented, abortion was necessary for the safety of the mother's life. However, is it still ethical to perform an abortion on a mother who is not in danger? The question of whether it is ethical or not stems from the notion that ""abortion is the killing of an unborn baby, which is human and very well alive."" Is it really alive tough? Biologically, for an organism to be alive, its organs must be able to perform its functions (http://www.biology-online.org...). For instance, if the organism has functioning organs, like a heart that provides blood to the rest of the body, it can be considered alive. With that being said, was an aborted fetus alive (according to our definition) before the medical procedure was performed? If we can agree with the definition provided by the scientific source provided, no, the aborted fetus was NOT alive to begin with. Abortions are safely performed during the first trimester of the pregnancy, or the first twelve weeks of the pregnancy (http://www.pamf.org...). So does the fetus have functioning organs in the first trimester? Again, it doesn't. While organs like the brain begin forming during the second month of the pregnancy, they actually don't start functioning after the 21st week of the pregnancy. In fact, one of the first organs to begin functioning, the kidneys, don't start to function after the 13th week, by which time doctors hesitate to perform an abortion because it puts the mother's life at risk (http://www.acog.org...). Lastly, I would also like to refute the idea that the fetus is able to feel pain. This just isn't true. To put it simply, pain receptors transmit signals to the brain, which brings out a sensation we call ""pain"". The keyword in this explanation is the term ""pain receptor"". Pain receptors are part of the PNS (Peripheral Nervous System), and the PNS is not functional during the first trimester of the pregnancy (http://education.jhu.edu...). Therefore, based on the biological development of a fetus, the fetus CANNOT feel pain during the abortion period.",PRO,"For instance, if the organism has functioning organs, like a heart that provides blood to the rest of the body, it can be considered alive. ...

abortion,"My opponent continues to insist that by criminalizing abortion will just move abortion underground where they will continue at the same rate. His underlying assumption is that the reason for the decrease in abortion rates is because of the law passed to allow abortions. Abortions actually increased rapidly after Roe vs Wade [3, 4], And the decrease in only slightly lower than it was before the decision. This decrease is primarily because of the increase in the effectiveness and use, Of contraceptives [1], The prevalent lower pregnancy rates [10], And the decrease of the social stigma towards childbirth outside of wedlock. This decreasing trend wouldn""t be affected if abortion was illegal, As contraception would continue to be more developed and used as the years pass. Whilst it may continue underground for a period of time, The abortion rates should steadily decrease at the same rate that they are now. As that rate of abortion decreases, The amount of abortions and mortality rates of the mother will in turn also decrease. Whilst my opponent may say that their have been greater rates of mortality before abortion became legal, He does not consider the possibility that they may decrease when going from having abortion legal, To the having it illegal. Take the example of Chile. In 1988 abortion was legal in Chile, And a year later, In 1989, Abortion was illegal under all circumstances. Studies show that although Chile made abortion illegal, The maternal mortality rates (MMR) are some of the lowest in the world [2, 5, 6], Which is contrary to common belief that by making abortion illegal you are increasing the MMR in that country. I am also not debating for the criminalisation of abortion, But rather that it should be made illegal. Take the example of wearing a seat belt. By not wearing a seat belt, You are essentially breaking the law by not wearing your seat belt. Although this is illegal, You are not considered as a criminal. Abortion should have legal consequences through the eyes of the law. Whilst I realise that many pro-life supporters push for the criminalisation of abortion, And the prosecution of it as murder. I am not arguing this point, And am instead arguing that it should be illegal, And that it is immoral. The problem with current law is that having an abortion is considered less in the eyes of the law than not wearing your own seat belt. Abortion very much involves the deliberate termination of a human life, And that is considered as a lesser offence than not wearing your seat belt. Just because the effect of having a certain act viewed as illegal may possibly turn out negatively does not mean that the law should instead view that act positively. Infanticide is an act that is viewed by the law as negative, Yet is less about punishing the person and more about helping them [7, 9], And providing a much needed view on what is considered right and wrong by the law. The same, If less, Would be applied to abortion. Infanticide is less of a crime than homicide, So I would assume that abortion would be less of a offence as infanticide. People who fall pregnant due to rape or incest, The problem is with the rape and incest. The child should not be punished for the wrong of its parents. The is no reason that a child born out of rape should be denied the right to life. I would also like to point out that my opponent has yet to provide a reason as to why abortion is not immoral.

abortion,"Let's get straight into it. I look forward to this debate. First point: Abortion is not necessary. Many pro-abortioners believe that they have a strong point when they use abortion as an answer to saving the mother's life, should there be complications or illness. In 2012, medical professionals in Dublin concluded that abortion is never necessary to save the mother's life. It is possible to give alternatives for those in danger, such as inducing an early delivery and increasing the chances of saving both the life of the mother and the child. A former abortionist, Dr Anthony Levatino, agreed: ""During my time at Albany Medical Center I managed hundreds of such cases by ""terminating"" pregnancies [via live delivery by C-section] to save mother's lives. In all those cases, the number of unborn children I had to deliberately kill was zero."" (1). While there is, of course, the possibility that the child may not survive, their chances are far, far higher than those offered by abortion, which promotes that idea that killing the child solves the problem and that it is the best way to do so. Abortion is not necessary, so why is it so popular? Second point: Abortion is dangerous. Abortion is very dangerous for women (not to mention it kills the baby most of the time). In fact, it is more dangerous than childbirth. While the accepted statistic is that childbirth is the more dangerous of the two, there is still the fact that most deaths by abortion are not recorded. This is due to several reasons. When a woman at an abortion clinic experiences severe complications (eg, from a botched abortion that has caused serious internal bleeding), she is rushed to the nearest hospital and left to the care of the doctors there, as it seems most abortion clinics do not keep doctors who specialise in saving lives on hand. If the woman dies at the hospital, it is not recorded as an abortion-related death on her death certificate. An example of this is shown by a college student who was forced to have an abortion by her parents so she could finish her time at college. She developed an infection which turned septic, she was rushed into ICU, she had brain damage, and was eventually just discharged to a nursing home. When she died, her death was not shown on the certificate as caused by abortion. In 2009, the CDC reported that more than 400 women have died from legalised abortion. These are just the deaths caused by the physical problems. Only 45 out of the 50 states in the US even keep abortion records (2)(3). For those who do survive with no apparent hospitalisation-requiring side effects, there can be complications further on in life. For example, a woman who has had an abortion and decides later that she wants to get pregnant and carry the child to term is more likely to suffer from problems like ectopic pregnancy or sterility than a woman who has not had an abortion. Ectopic pregnancies are dangerous, and account for twelve percent of pregnancy-related maternal deaths (this is recorded as death caused by pregnancy, not by abortion). A woman who has had one abortion is twice as likely to develop an ectopic pregnancy than a woman who has never aborted, and for one who has had two or more abortions the risk is up to four times as high. Pelvic Inflammatory Disease is also another possible complication, which is an infection that can lead to fever and infertility, and is quoted as being a ""common and serious complication of induced abortion and has been reported in up to 30% of all cases"". In the year 2000, a study in Finland showed that women who abort are four times more likely to die in the following year than those who carry to term. (4) Third Point: Abortion has negative mental/emotional side effects. Emotional and psychological effects after abortion are more common than physical side effects. Such emotional/psychological effects include as follows: regret, anger, guilt, shame, sense of loneliness/isolation, loss of self-confidence, insomnia/nightmares, relationship issues, suicidal thoughts/feelings, eating disorders, depression, anxiety. These side effects are fairly likely to occur, but even more likely in the following situations. Firstly, when the women have been coerced, forced, or persuaded to have an abortion. The fact that they had to be pressured into it means they were reluctant to in the first place, and this would understandably leave them with guilt and shame. Also, no one should ever be pressured into doing something like abortion. I do believe it is murder and many people around the world agree, and if it is being promoted in the name of choice then why are women being pressured into it? Secondly, if they had religious beliefs/moral or ethical views that conflicted abortion. Going against one's beliefs can easily leave a person feeling guilty and shamed, and with the feeling of having done something horribly wrong. Thirdly, if the women had no S/O or partner, and if the baby was reported to have had genetic/fatal abnormalities, or if the abortion was carried out at a later stage in the pregnancy (5). A woman whose baby would not have a father figure in its life may feel under pressure to abort the baby due to financial stress or not wanting it to live without a father figure, but afterward may look back on her situation and see that it was not as desperate as she imagined. Also, a baby with genetic or fatal abnormalities should not be aborted for that reason. There are many babies who have conditions such as microcephaly and Down syndrome who are living wonderful lives and bringing such joy to their families (6). Babies with genetic abnormalities deserve love and to be cherished. Whether they will die days after birth or years after, they deserve the opportunity to be loved and not killed before being given the chance to live. There are babies who have, despite all expectations, lived longer than the doctors said and they have brought joy to their parents, not to mention the peace that comes with knowing you gave a child life rather than took it away prematurely. My final point: Abortion breaks the Hippocratic Oath that all Medical Students have to take. All medical students do, at some point, have to take the Hippocratic Oath (in some variation or other, but still the same oath). In the Hippocratic Oath's original form, there is included the following statement, ""I will neither give a deadly drug to anybody who asked for it, nor will I make a suggestion to this effect. Similarly I will not give a woman an abortive remedy. In purity and holiness I will guard my life and my art."" Anthropologist Margaret Mead said concerning the Oath, ""For the first time in our tradition there was a complete separation between killing and curing...One profession, the followers of Asclepius, were to be dedicated completely to life under all circumstances, regardless of rank, age, intellect- the life of a slave, the life of the Emperor, the life of a foreign man, the life of a defective child..."" (Asclepius was the Greek god who the doctors/physicians of that time followed). The 1948 Declaration of Geneva brought the Oath up to date, including the following statement, ""I will maintain the utmost respect for human life, from the time of conception; even under threat, I will not use my medical knowledge contrary to the laws of humanity."" And the 1949 International Code of Medical Ethics states also, ""A doctor must always bear in mind the obligation of preserving human life from conception.""(7). Abortionists are considered to be doctors, but they are clearly breaking this oath that they took upon joining the medical profession, as they are causing death and showing no respect for human life, which an unborn child obviously has. Abortion comes highly recommended these days, despite the oath which should probably be considered a little more. As abortion can be so destructive to women and is pretty much always death for the child, we can only say that abortion ""doctors"" have broken the oath and have no respect for human life, and are using their medical knowledge contrary to the laws of humanity.

It clearly states that Abortion refers only to the act of losing the pregnancy, not how or why. It does not matter whether the mother has the intent of having the abortion performed, the abortion still occurs. The act of kicking a pregnant woman in the stomach, or pushing her off a flight of stairs, with the intention of terminating the pregnancy is abortion, but it is also an act of assault. I am against this, I don't believe I can make my argument any simpler. 2. PARTIAL BIRTH ABORTIONS My opponent has offered no response to my argument. SPONTANEOUS ABORTIONS 3. My opponent has offered no response to my argument. 4. DANGEROUS ABORTIONS My opponent has offered no response to my argument. ********************************************************** My opponent ends his second round by speaking about immorality. Although his argument would be relevant if we were talking specifically about an intended abortion that did not fall under the 4 categories I listed above, it is regretfully irrelevant now. My opponent speaks on moral relativity and how he believes it negates my assertion that kicking a woman in the stomach to terminate her pregnancy may or may not be immoral. I find this to be a poor argument as he himself has provided the following definition: Immoral: -not in conformity with accepted principles of right and wrong behavior As such, we can all agree that what is immoral or moral is determined by society or popularity. I ask the audience as well as my opponent a very simple question: ""Is the act of kicking a woman in the stomach to terminate her pregnancy an immoral act?"" The answer is yes. ********************************************************** My opponent then gives his argument about women who were raped. Women who report the rape or are sent to the hospital get Plan B as a procedural precaution. In the case that women do not report the rape, they have full access to Plan B over the counter. Termination of a pregnancy should be allowed for extremely strange circumstances, such as if a woman is held in some dungeon and raped over the course of an entire month, or such similar case where they have no access to emergency contraception and are already pregnant. ********************************************************** My opponent's other two arguments about teenage pregnancy and unprotected sex fall under the same category. Emergency contraception is readily available, and there really should be no need for abortion as a common, medical procedure dealing with irresponsibility. My opponent portrays medical abortion as the end-all-be-all to all unwanted pregnancy situations. The first line of defense is abstinence. There is plenty of porn on the internet and little to no need for sexual activity prior to the development of responsibility. The second line of defense is contraception. There are many forms of them available and they are all quite effective. In addition, there are natural ways to lessen the chance of pregnancy such as monitoring the menstrual cycle. It takes quite a bit of irresponsibility to bypass those. But even at this stage, we have Plan B, the morning-after-pill, which prevents pregnancy as a form of emergency contraception, effective for 72 hours. If we're dealing with a pair of people who want to have sex, without any sort of protection, who do not withdraw or use any method of pregnancy prevention, and who refuse to purchase Emergency Contraception the day after, then we should probably assume they want to be parents. There is no lack of information. There is no lack of teaching. There are plenty of ways to prevent pregnancy even well after the act of unprotected sex has occurred. There really is no excuse for requiring an abortion under any circumstances save for the most bizarre and uncommon ones. That having been said, heavily restricting abortion as a means of pregnancy termination will do far more good than harm. The assumption that there is always a last line of defense will only lead to more irresponsible behavior. Thus, by making emergency contraception the last line of defense, we move the line in the sand and the risks are reduced. ********************************************************** My opponent has ignored three of the four points I made in the first round. I remind my opponent that since he has offered no objection to my arguments regarding scope, he has agreed to the resolution of Abortion in general. Thus, his burden is to show that Abortion is acceptable in all circumstances. Until he does this, he has not met the burden. Thank you.",CON,"On the other hand, it could be classified as an act of assault as well. ... I refer my opponent back to the medical definition I submitted in my first round.",170
abortion,"My opponent has used the term dirty birdies. dirty birdie: A person who exhibits extreme perversion and an unbridled enjoyment for all things sexual. [1] My opponent has basically referred to every person's mother on this site as an extreme pervert because the only criteria that he provided was that they were not using birth control or a condom. Additionally he has not defined good. Let us look at some of the effects on women who have abortions: Physical Problems Elevated risk of death: a 1997 government funded study in Finland, women who abort are approximately four times more likely to die in the following year than women who carry their pregnancies to term. In addition, women who carry to term are only half as likely to die as women who were not pregnant. [2] Cervical, ovarian and liver cancer: Women with a history of one abortion face a 2.3 times higher risk of having cervical cancer, compared to women with no history of abortion. Women with two or more abortions face a 4.92 relative risk. Similar elevated risks of subsequent ovarian and liver cancer have also been linked to single and multiple abortions. These increased cancer rates for post-aborted women may be linked to the unnatural disruption of the hormonal changes which accompany pregnancy and untreated cervical damage or to increased stress and the negative impact of stress on the immune system. [2] Uterine Perforations: Between 2 and 3% of all abortion patients may suffer perforation of their uterus, yet most of these injuries will remain undiagnosed and untreated unless laparoscopic visualization is performed. [2] Cervical Lacerations: Significant cervical lacerations requiring sutures occur in at least one percent of first trimester abortions...Latent post-abortion cervical damage may result in subsequent cervical incompetence, premature delivery, and complications of labor. The risk of cervical damage is greater for teenagers, for second trimester abortions, and when practitioners fail to use laminaria for dilation of the cervix. [2] Placenta Previa: Abortion increases the risk of placenta previa in later pregnancies (a life threatening condition for both the mother and her wanted pregnancy) by seven to fifteen fold. Abnormal development of the placenta due to uterine damage increases the risk of fetal malformation, perinatal death, and excessive bleeding during labor. [2] Labour Complications: Women who had one, two, or more previous induced abortions are, respectively, 1.89, 2.66, or 2.03 times more likely to have a subsequent pre-term delivery, compared to women who carry to term. Prior induced abortion not only increased the risk of premature delivery, it also increased the risk of delayed delivery. Women who had one, two, or more induced abortions are, respectively, 1.89, 2.61, and 2.23 times more likely to have a post-term delivery (over 42 weeks). Pre-term delivery increases the risk of neonatal death and handicaps. [2] Handicapped Newborns: Abortion is associated with cervical and uterine damage which may increase the risk of premature delivery, complications of labor and abnormal development of the placenta in later pregnancies. These reproductive complications are the leading causes of handicaps among newborns. [2] Ectopic Pregnancy: Abortion is significantly related to an increased risk of subsequent ectopic pregnancies. Ectopic pregnancies, in turn, are life threatening and may result in reduced fertility. [2] PID: PID is a potentially life threatening disease which can lead to an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy and reduced fertility. Of patients who have a chlamydia infection at the time of the abortion, 23% will develop PID within 4 weeks. Studies have found that 20 to 27% of patients seeking abortion have a chlamydia infection. Approximately 5% of patients who are not infected by chlamydia develop PID within 4 weeks after a first trimester abortion. It is therefore reasonable to expect that abortion providers should screen for and treat such infections prior to an abortion. [2] Immediate complications: Approximately 10% of women undergoing elective abortion will suffer immediate complications, of which approximately one-fifth (20%) are considered life threatening. The nine most common major complications which can occur at the time of an abortion are: infection, excessive bleeding, embolism, ripping or perforation of the uterus, anesthesia complications, convulsions, hemorrhage, cervical injury, and endotoxic shock...women who have multiple abortions face a much greater risk of experiencing these complications. This point is especially noteworthy since approximately 45% of all abortions are for repeat aborters. [2] Increased rate for teenagers: Teenagers, who account for about 30 percent of all abortions, are also at much high risk of suffering many abortion related complications. This is true of both immediate complications, and of long-term reproductive damage. [2] Lower General Health: In a survey of 1428 women researchers found that pregnancy loss, and particularly losses due to induced abortion, was significantly associated with an overall lower health. Multiple abortions correlated to an even lower evaluation of “present health.” While miscarriage was detrimental to health, abortion was found to have a greater correlation to poor health. These findings support previous research which reported that during the year following an abortion women visited their family doctors 80% more for all reasons and 180% more for psychosocial reasons. The authors also found that “if a partner is present and not supportive, the miscarriage rate is more than double and the abortion rate is four times greater than if he is present and supportive. If the partner is absent the abortion rate is six times greater.” [2] Psychological Problems Requirement of Psychological Treatment: A study of the medical records of 56,741 California Medicaid patients revealed that women who had abortions were 160 percent more likely than delivering women to be hospitalized for psychiatric treatment in the first 90 days following abortion or delivery. Rates of psychiatric treatment remained significantly higher for at least four years...Most significant was the finding that 25% of women who had abortions made visits to psychiatrists as compared to 3% of the control group. [2] Suicide:Researchers in Finland have identified a strong statistical association between abortion and suicide in a records based study (see figure at the right). They found that the mean annual suicide rate for all women was 11.3 per 100,000 but the rate for women following abortion was 34.7 per 100,000, three times higher. The suicide rate associated with birth, by contrast, was half the rate of all women and less than one-sixth the rate of suicide among women who had abortions...Suicide attempts appear to be especially prevalent among post-abortion teenagers. Numerous other studies have also revealed higher rates of suicide and suicide attempts associated with abortion. [2] Alcohol & Drugs: Over twenty studies have linked abortion to increased rates of drug and alcohol use. Abortion is significantly linked with a two fold increased risk of alcohol abuse among women. [2] Eating Disorders: For at least some women, post-abortion stress is associated with eating disorders such as binge eating, bulimia, and anorexia nervosa. [2] Sexual Dysfunction: Thirty to fifty percent of the women who experience difficulty adjusting to a past abortion report experiencing sexual dysfunctions, of both short and long duration, beginning immediately after their abortions. These problems may include one or more of the following: loss of pleasure from intercourse, increased pain, an aversion to sex and/or males in general, or the development of a promiscuous life-style. [2] PTSD: While psychological reactions to abortion fall into many categories, some women experience all or some of they symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The lowest incidence rate of PTSD reported following abortion is 1.5%, which would translate to over 600,000 cases of abortion induced PTSD.Another study found that 14% of American women have all the symptoms of PTSD and attribute them to their abortions, with as many as 65% reporting some, but not all symptoms of PTSD. [2] Definition: Good: Being positive or desirable in nature; not bad or poor [3] Thus given the many physical and psychological detriments to abortion it cannot be classified as good.

abortion,"First I want to make it clear, We have to see both of internal and external effect of abortion, So I say Of course religion and culture effected to the mother as the society. Environment shape the character of the society. If the baby's mom live in bad environment like kind of society that do not know what's the basic rule in society, Less educated people, No religion, Kind of society that live only for food. Of course they'll develop in a bad personality. Free sex, No marriage, The mom that grow in this kind of society will never think that abortion is illegal right. This case often we see in develop country, Abortion is a common thing to do. And if you say that law isn't that important in this case, Then maybe you should know that your support to stop abortion has no guarantee because law is the basic rule to do something. Like in netherland the law said that it's legal to do abortion with several terms to follow and in Indonesia it's forbid to do abortion. So law is affected to abortion also. But, Unfortunately you said that it's something that you won't to debate about, Then I'll leave it. Type of abortion. Yes we agree that the baby is innocent, But we have to see from all side point of view. The first case, What if the baby was occur in a criminal event like rape, It will break the woman's mentally and never want the baby from that violence. If they let the mom to continue the pregnancy then maybe the baby will born and unwanted thing will be happen like the mom will throw him out, Do the kid violence, And grow as a people that get no love, This kind of society is at risk to begrown up as criminal at the end of the day. Second, The abortion may be done if the pregnancy is risky for the mom then they may do the abortion.

Both the woman and man will get the burden physically and morally. They have decide to undergo abortion means they ready to lost something, To get the consequences. That's the consequences of the free sex they did (that most of case of abortion are performed because free sex). At the end of the day, We may say we shouldn't punish the baby, But at end the actors will get the punishment or pressure they might get. It's about who can or cannot stand it. Maybe the person that have do abortion several times like prostitute worker maybe get used to the burden she get.

abortion,"Yes the government has the obligation to protect the rights of people, in general. Women have a right to decide whether and when to become a parent.

Getting an abortion is periodically wrong and no women should even think of it. Even if they have to carry the baby for 9 months.

The most important argument against abortion would be- can we choose to kill unwanted pregnancies?

abortion,"Look, to start this off, I would like the Con to know that I myself do not believe in abortion. But the one thing I do believe in is the freedom of choice. I'm not sure what religion the Con believes in, but the God of Christianity would not want women's freedom of choice taken away over such an issue. I know for sure though, that if your amendment rights were taken from you, that you would get a little angry. (Who wouldn't, though?) For one, abortion is not always because a teen girl has unprotected sex. Though that is a contributor, it is not the leading cause for abortion. When thinking about abortion, you also have to consider those who were raped. And no, people don't get chose to get raped. Should a woman have to pay the price if SHE is the victim??

abortion,"Hi. Today I have decided that I would debate on the topic of Abortion. I personally believe that Abortion is wrong and immoral. Anyone who would like to accept this debate may. Arguments 1. I would like to begin by pointing this out. First off, abortion is legal, in someplaces even if the fetus is considered grown enough to be a baby. However, if you were to kill someone who was pregnant, you would be charged not only for the murder of the woman but also her baby. Or a double homicide. This suggests that legally, a unborn fetus qualifies as a human. Then why is abortion legal? 2. Abortion is morally wrong, I will prove this by explaining how a fetus, qualifies as a human 1. The unborn entity, from the moment of concept, is a full-fledged member of the human community 2. It is morally wrong to kill any member of that community 3. Every successful abortion kills an unborn entity, a full-fledged member of the human community 4. Therefore, every successful abortion is morally wrong 3. Scientists have concluded that infact life begins at conception. I am going to ASSUME that this is true for my next statement. If it were true that life begins at conception, then if you were to have an abortion it would legally be murder, Murder: The unlawful killing of someone Killing: To deprive of life : cause the death of So in this case, assuming the Pro agrees with my definitions, abortion is killing.

Would a doctor have to review the current state of their lives and make a decision for every person who wanted an abortion? That just doesn't seem fair or practical.

Yes, I am well aware of the sort of depression that can occur after an abortion and in some cases can occur annually during the time of the abortion. It does happen and it is a terrible thing, But I do believe that only a certain number of mothers who abort suffer from that side effect and that doesn't compare to the amount of almost guaranteed pain the mother would feel. The mothers who are more likely to commit suicide after an abortion is likely due to the lack of government funds or funds in general that companies like Planned Parenthood need to help a mother cope with the aftermath of an abortion. Also, Mothers who do regret getting an abortion are likely not rape victims. If the child was made on accident and the mother and father aren't prepared for parenthood, An abortion is a good choice but not the cause. I do not believe that they regret the choice of getting an abortion, I believe that most people whom you speak of regret not being careful enough or not prepared enough to be a parent.",PRO,"Yes, I am well aware of the sort of depression that can occur after an abortion and in some cases can occur annually during the time of the abortion. ...

If a woman is denied an abortion, she is more likely to become unemployed, live below the poverty line, and depend of public welfare. Modern day abortion is very safe. Women actually have a much higher chance of dying from childbirth, than having an abortion. If a woman really wants an abortion, she may even travel to another country, or get an illegal abortion and the procedure may not be as sanitary and safe and she would be putting her life at risk.

abortion,"Point 1: I am sorry, but your comment about my Point 1 from Round 2 I do not get. I was trying to say that the prohibition of abortion will end up like the prohibition of alcohol. Abortions will start being done in the home by someone with no medical training, and there will be an increase in illegal abortion. Point 2: ""For 1972, the last full year before Roe, the federal Centers for Disease Control reported that 39 women died due to illegal abortion."":http://www.straightdope.com.... Yes, only 39 women died of illegal abortion in the United States in 1972. Point 3: ""The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that in 1972 alone, 130,000 women obtained illegal or self-induced procedures, 39 of whom died."":http://www.guttmacher.org.... This means that at least 260,000 people broke the law by having an illegal abortion. That number only takes into account the woman and the doctor. There could be more the 2 involced in one abortion. The prohibition of abortion will again cause 130,000+ crimes. And they need solving. Police are already having a hard time controlling crime. Adding 130,000+ crimes with at least 260,000 people involved will make the police department a mess. Point 4: ""In 1967, England liberalized its abortion law to permit any woman to have an abortion with the written consent of two physicians. More than 600 American women made the trip to the United Kingdom during the last three months of 1969 alone"" ""The year before the Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade, just over 100,000 women left their own state to obtain a legal abortion in New York City"":http://www.guttmacher.org.... This means that is abortion is made illegal, then thousands of women will travel to a foreign country that legalizes abortion. In other words, they will bypass the law. Point 5: ""The proportion of abortions obtained early in the first trimester has risen from 20% in 1970 to 56% in 1998"": http://www.guttmacher.org.... This means that since the legalization of abortion in 1973, there has been a sharp increase in the percentage of abortions, legal or illegal, done in the first trimester. And approximately 55% of abortions in the year 2000 were done before the 8th week of pregnancy; up from 23% in 1972.: Website: http://www.guttmacher.org... ; Website's source: Trends in Abortion in the United States, 1973-2000 and Abortion and Women's Health. So most babies aborted do not feel any pain. Point 6: One of the four major factors that decreased crime in the 1990s was abortion: http://pricetheory.uchicago.edu.... ""The underlying theory rests on two premises: 1) unwanted children are at greater risk for crime, and 2) legalized abortion leads to a reduction in the number of unwanted births."" :http://pricetheory.uchicago.edu... ""These children who were born because their mothers were denied a nabortion were substantially more likely to be involved in crime, even when controlling for the income, age, education and health of the mother."":http://pricetheory.uchicago.edu.... ""For instance, homicide fell 25.9 percent in high-abortion states between 1985 and 1997 compared to an INCREASE of 4.1 percent in low-abortion states. Panel data estimates confiï¿½rm the strong negative relationship between lagged abortion and crime. An analysis of arrest rates by age reveal that only arrests of those born after abortion legalization are affected by the law change."":http://pricetheory.uchicago.edu.... There are so many great passages on this website to list all here. To have a better understanding of what this article is saying, read the article from the bottom of page 19 to the top of page 21. Also, look at the graphs throughout the article. Here is the article again: http://pricetheory.uchicago.edu.... And no, I can not prove the prohibiting abortion would just increase crime and poverty in the United States, but I can prove the legalizing abortion has decreased crime. Point 7: ""For example, Dagg (1991) reports that these women overwhelmingly kept their babies, rather than giving them up for adoption, but that they often resented the unwanted children."": http://pricetheory.uchicago.edu.... This shows that if a woman is denied an abortion, she will most likely keep it instead of putting it up for adoption. Point 8: ""I think people should pay for their mistakes."" Yes, I think the mother should have to pay, but why make an innocent child pay? As pointed previously, an overwhelming percentage of poor people have abortions. So if they were denied an abortion, you are not only making the mother pay, but you are also making the child pay. You are making the child pay through making him or her live in poverty for 18 years, and most likely, in poverty his or her whole life. Point 9: Also with the last few points, I have proved that legalizing abortion does not increase the number of people in poverty, and the prohibition of abortion will increase the number of people in poverty, Point 10: Proving that abortion is a right that women need is unnecessary. They have the right to abort if necessary. Point 11: ""Preemies begin to feel pain around a woman's 35th week of pregnancy, about two to four weeks before delivery, according to a new study from University College London."": http://abcnews.go.com.... The exact date when fetuses begin to feel pain will probably never be answered. It is all a matter of one's opinion and of one's stance on abortion. I am sure it is not the 35th week of pregnancy, but there are extreme and radical answers on both sides. But the major concensus is 20 weeks: http://www.omaha.com..., http://www.godandscience.org..., http://news.discovery.com.... Point 12: Having a lower social status makes you more vulnerable to mental diseases or the other way around depending on what side you take: http://en.wikipedia.org.... A good article on the relationship between low income and social status to mental disorders: http://epirev.oxfordjournals.org... Point 13: In February 2003, the US National Cancer Institute (NCI) held a workshop of more than 100 of the world's leading experts who study pregnancy and breast cancer risk. The experts reviewed human and animal studies that looked at the link between pregnancy and breast cancer risk, including studies of induced and spontaneous abortions. Some of their findings were: • Breast cancer risk is increased for a short time after a full-term pregnancy (that is, a pregnancy that results in the birth of a living child). • Induced abortion is not linked to an increase in breast cancer risk. • Spontaneous abortion is not linked to an increase in breast cancer risk. The level of scientific evidence for these findings was considered to be ""well established"" (the highest level): http://www.cancer.org.... Point 14: Adoption is a bumpy ride for most children. Point 15: Young people do not know how to take care of a baby, and most likely, the parent is not willing to help. So its either the baby suffer from bad parenting at the hands of the girl, or go through the bumpy ride of adoption. Abortion seems like a very logical choice. ==Conclusion== My return arguments disprove most of my opponents claims.

abortion,"The resolution is: Abortion should be legal in all cases through the first trimester (in other words, we are not debating late-term abortion). Contention 1: Pregnancy causes a higher rate of breast cancer than abortion. Therefore, a forced birth of the fetus puts the mother at a greater risk for breast cancer than if she was allowed to have an abortion. It's not the abortion that causes breast cancer so much as it is the hormones that run through her body when she is pregnant. These hormones put her at a greater chance of breast cancer than otherwise. These hormones intensify thorugh the course of pregnancy, meaning that a first-trimester abortion would mean fewer hormones running through her body than during birth, meaning that a forced birth puts the mother at a great risk for breast cancer than if she was alllowed to have an abortion. The earlier, the better. ""In February 2003, the US National Cancer Institute (NCI) held a workshop of more than 100 of the worldï¿½€™s leading experts who study pregnancy and breast cancer risk. The experts reviewed human and animal studies that looked at the link between pregnancy and breast cancer risk, including studies of induced and spontaneous abortions.

The level of scientific evidence for these findings was considered to be ï¿½€œwell establishedï¿½€ï¿½ (the highest level).""[1] This pretty much proves my point. Pregnancy-->more hormones-->greater risk for breast cancer. Abortion helps REDUCE the risk of breast cancer. Then why is there such a strong belief that abortion causes breast cancer? Two reasons. One, pro-life people are very adement about their cause. They accept whatever information they are given, no matter the sources or quality of the study. So naturally, there will be significant flaws in their findings. But why the flaws? Because pro-lifers are using old data. They care so much about their cause that they don't even check the date of the study. Years ago, there were several studies linking abortion to an increased chance of breast cancer. But since then, there has been an enormous amount of studies debunking the claim. ""Extremist, religious anti-choice web sites are using old data from an old study as proof of a cause and effect relationship even while the National Cancer Institute and one of the study's own authors clearly state that over the course of years of research, including those old studies, overall evidence indicates no connection between the two. ""[2] Contention 2: The major crime decline in the 1990s was partially caused by the Roe vs. Wade 1973 overturn of the abortion ban. Many people have been trying to debunk this connection, but it is very easy to see the link. ""The underlying theory rests on two premises: 1) unwanted children are at greater risk for crime, and 2) legalized abortion leads to a reduction in the number of unwanted births.""""These children who were born because their mothers were denied an abortion were substantially more likely to be involved in crime, even when controlling for the income, age, education and health of the mother."" Now for the killer: ""The magnitude of the differences in the crime decline between high- and low-abortion states was over 25 percent for homicide, violent crime and property crime. For instance, homicide fell 25.9 percent in high-abortion states between 1985 and 1997 compared to an increase of 4.1 percent in low-abortion states.""[3] Not to mention, the groups of people who commit crime more often had higher abortion rates than low-crime groups. This is even more evidence of the connection. ""Forty-two percent of women obtaining abortions have incomes below 100% of the federal poverty level ($10,830 for a single woman with no children). Twenty-seven percent of women obtaining abortions have incomes between 100–199% of the federal poverty level.""""Non-Hispanic white women account for 36% of abortions, non-Hispanic black women for 30%, Hispanic women for 25% and women of other races for 9%."" (please take into account of percentage of these races in porportion of the population)[4] What does this show? That the higher-crime groups have a higher abortion rate, and so the crime rate is measurable. Contention 3: Prohibiting abortion will increase the amount of crimes and will be bypassed. ""The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that in 1972 alone, 130,000 women obtained illegal or self-induced procedures, 39 of whom died.""[4] This means that at least 260,000 people broke the law by having an illegal abortion. That number only takes into account the woman and the doctor. There could be more the 2 involced in one abortion. The prohibition of abortion will again cause 130,000+ crimes. And they need solving. Police are already having a hard time controlling crime. Adding 130,000+ crimes with at least 260,000 people involved will make the police department a mess.

More than 600 American women made the trip to the United Kingdom during the last three months of 1969 alone""""The year before the Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade, just over 100,000 women left their own state to obtain a legal abortion in New York City.""[4] This means that is abortion is made illegal, then thousands of women will travel to a foreign country that legalizes abortion. In other words, they will bypass the law. Contention 4: Prohibiting abortion would increase the unemployment rate and the Government debt. Here is some simple logic. Say abortion is still illegal. Then the 1 million babies aborted each year would raise the unemployment rate tremendously (based on Guttermacher estimates on abortion, unemployment would be between 15-20%). More babies from the 1980s now=a higher unemployment and povery rate. And more simple logic. Say abortion is still illegal. Than the 56 million babies that would have survived may pay more taxes, but since over 90% are in the bottom 47% of the population (money wise), they don't pay any taxes (Look it up if you doubt me about the 47% not paying taxes). Also, they are sucking up Government Welfare money. So they would increase the Government Debt, not decrease. Now some might say more people=greater GDP. But I have proved earlier that the poor are more likely to have abortions, and so the contribution is small. You might also say more people=more people to hire. But this is refuted with simple logic again. If there are only 1,000 jobs available, it dosen't matter if there are 100, 1000, 10000, or 100000 ready to fill the job because there are only 1,000 jobs available. Contention 5: The non-aborted babies would lead a bad life. Do you think the babies that were aborted by these 69% of women who are single, and make a yearly income of less then $21,660 would have had a very good life? Do you think they would ever have a chance? Say those 69% of women were not able to abort. Those children grew up in terrible surroundings surrounded by violence, murder, want, and laziness. I am sure a lot of those children would grow up to become theives and even murderers. And I am sure a lot of those would end up in jail. These children would be better off not being born.

Mr. Allot has many articles supporting his anti abortion stance in a variety of conservative news publicans. I would love to see the study he references, but he does not provide a source.

I will not assert or continue any debate about what one personally should feel about the act of abortion in-and-of-itself. I personally don't like it, choose not to do it, but must conclude the option is better supported than not allowed.

A population can only sustain a certain amount of people based on the groups ability to also sustain ""access"" to food/water resources and space for the individuals to live. (Please answer YES or NO) 2. If there are more people than what can be provided for, some portion will suffer and die. (YES or NO) 3. Thus we can conclude that it is always in our best interest to keep open options for the population's control, in order to balance our sustainability. (YES or NO) Conclusion: Abortion is favored Conclusion is elaborated on: to reduce the amount of suffering and needless death of those brought into the world, only to suffer and die, should constitute a good thing; for it adds to the well-being of the people capable of continuing existence. Any life which comes into this world does not only impact it's own existence, but others, sometimes a few, sometimes many. The pregnancy can severely inhibit (circumstantially dependent) the mother's ability to sustain other areas of her life (health / opportunity), which in turn can impact other possible children already born and cared for, and/or future children yet to come. The possible resources and energy used to sustain that life, that will inevitably die, is in some sense a wasted expense that serves no one other than a misguided and seemingly cruel mind, because it needlessly holds onto the idea that this person must live despite its destined desolation. Even worse is when abortion is railed against by those whom proclaim they are fighting for a possible life they themselves are not willing to take care of, and will soon as possible turn a blind eye to the forthcoming, REAL suffering of lives effected by ""their choices"". This moves me directly to the next part of my argument. **Human rights** Here I will make the argument that the options of abortion is foremost the right of the person in which the possible life will be sustained. Those rights include: first this person's right to control their bodily functions in such a way that they can be considered to have aspirations to full participation, equal membership and active involvement in society. Without the right of reproductive choice, all other human rights: civil and political, economic and social, have only limited power to advance the well-being of the person. 1. The person for which abortion is not an option must, by virtue of circumstance, be unable to participate as an equal and active member of society. (YES or NO) 2. The option for safe access to abortion allows the person the opportunity to participate as an equal and active member of society. (YES or NO) 3. Thus we can conclude that the option to alleviate such disability is good; it allows for the person to maintain their human rights. This is good for the individual and society. Conclusion: Abortion is favored Conclusion is elaborated on: It can be further demonstrated by historical standards of human relations that, because of the person who bares the child, they, without abortion options, are forced to be dependent on others for well-being (with but few exceptions). By the words of Charlotte Perkins Gilman, "" Wealth, power, social distinction, fame ""not only these, but home and happiness, reputation, ease and pleasure, her bread and butter, --all, must come to her through a small gold ring"".... I would add state assistance(within certain countries); which is a whole other issue, but very contingent to the circumstances involved here. Although, Gilman was speaking about the choices available to women at the time, abortion plays a critical role in how women can combat the subservient and dependent life style, and maintain their independence and thus her human rights. I remind us of what Margaret Sanger wrote: ""No woman can call herself free until she can choose consciously whether she will or will not be a mother."" **Societal and individual health** Here I will make the argument that the health of society and the individual is better sustained with safe access to legal professional abortion. 1. Within society and/or with an individual trying to survive, abortion will happen. (YES or NO) 2. If no safe access to abortion is available, the means to accomplish the abortion are dangerous and lead to unsafe choices. The likelihood of the individual developing damaging health consequences (physically and mentally) and even contingent agents not directly involved in the abortion, can be great (YES or NO) 3. Legal and regulated safe access to professional abortion will provide better control for the health of the people. Conclusion: Abortion is favored Conclusion is elaborated on: as with most actions, the lack of action still has consequences. Here an argument is made that the results of not acting to provide safe access to abortion only increases the harm done. The fact that you or I don't like abortion does not reduce the fact that it will be done, and if we truly do care about the well-being of people, we will make the hard choice to allow safe access to professional abortions. **Reduction in criminal behavior** Here I will make the argument that allowing safe access to professional abortion reduces the criminal behavior involved in illegal abortion, including but not limited to, unregulated procedures: 1. Illegal abortions are unregulated, unprofessional, and can include a number of other illegal activities. (YES or NO) 2. Legal abortion can be regulated, with properly educated professionals, and will provide records of all actions involved in procedures needed to accomplish the task. 3. Legal safe access to professional abortion will reduce a large number of criminal activities that otherwise would not take place. Conclusion: Abortion is favored Conclusion is elaborated on: safe access to professional abortion reduces the criminal behavior involved in illegal abortion, including but not limited to, unregulated procedures: equipment used, location, and the number of criminal activities required to get access to drugs, etc... Also included are the lack of professional support with access to accurate and up-to-date information about all the things involved in abortion, i.e. history, modern understanding of the process, physiological analysis, physical exams before and after the procedure. I would like to add the form of payment, as it will be under the table and lacking any records of responsibility. Sources will be included in next round.

abortion,"Thank you for your response. After reading the peer reviewed report (abstract, but we have enough to work with) and the other sources linked in your previous round, I found even more compelling evidence to reject the Con position. At this point, I can see no way for Con to secure support. I am doing my best to clash in this debate. Con still has not adequately addressed maternal death, nor has he addressed the absolute nature of his position – abortion should be illegal. As I stated in the last round, even if Con can show that abortion causes post abortion depression, he is still not addressing my contention, maternal death. I responded to claims of post abortion depression because this is the only near relevant position Con presented after my first round. I will take Con's arguments in the order that he presented them: Complications to Abortion: I agree there are complications to abortion; it is an operation and all operations have complications, but those complications, as clearly stated in the study, result in less deaths than those associated with childbirth for some women. This point is all I needed to show your position does not consider these risks in any capacity. Your position does not even consider these matters since abortion should always be illegal. Con goes further and quotes the worldwide stats from a peer reviewed journal – thank you so much. I was going to leave the worldwide stats alone (hence the reason I focused on the US) but you brought them in so I will quote from your source: ""Both of the primary methods for preventing unsafe abortion—less restrictive abortion laws and greater contraceptive use—face social, religious, and political obstacles, particularly in developing nations, where most unsafe abortions (97%) occur."" Con, you are supposed to be attacking my position concerning maternal death. Instead, you presented the most restrictive abortion position, ""abortion should be illegal"" and provided stats showing that restrictive abortion laws are a leading cause in maternal death worldwide. Again, thank you. The maternal death rate from abortion vs. childbirth: Con relies on yet another anti abortion source to show that these rates are nearly the same. As I said, even if he can do this, he is still avoiding the elephant in the room. Now, Con suggests that the statistics provided are small (6/100,000 childbirth and 3/100,000 for abortion). The 6/100,000 is relative to dying in a car crash and Con supports the car crash analogy with a source (which his original source failed to do – nice work Con) Here is the problem though – Con's source jumped through some pretty fantastic hoops to get to this number. As shown in the ""Redefining the Parameters"" section of the report, This group made up a term called ""birth avoidance mortality"" so they could include deaths related to IUDs, hysterectomies, oral contraceptives, etc. I invite all reviewers to read this section and decide whether this redefinition is supported. I see little to consider here. Mr. Allot's credibility in relation to an unlinked study: Link the study and settle the issue. You, and many anti abortion sites, referenced this study. Where is it? I consider his reference less than credible because he does not give me the details I need to find it. I concede that depression may occur after an abortion, but the effects and the magnitude are not supported in the literature. The report I linked, and you quoted, said as much. Life at Conception: Con uses a horrible source that links another horrible source. Both are steeped in religiosity and the definition of life provided in the first can apply to crystal formations. As I made clear in the first round, you could have avoided a ""life at conception"" argument and I offered a helpful definition for you to do so, but you have now articulated this position so ectopic pregnancies have come into play. (See 1st round response) Ectopic Pregnancies: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov... As stated very clearly in this source: ""An ectopic pregnancy is an abnormal pregnancy that occurs outside the womb (uterus). The baby (fetus) cannot survive, and often does not develop at all in this type of pregnancy."" The death rate for ectopic pregnancy in the US is now at 0.1%. Why? Because the pregnancy is terminated safely. Your stance ""abortion is illegal"" combined with ""a fetus is born in the moment of conception"" puts women in great danger. Under your position, terminating an ectopic pregnancy is abortion and can no longer be tolerated. Do you wish to reconsider your position? Further Information: Con explains that youth (15-19) is a major reason for abortion rates but his own source states that of the abortions reported, women from 15-19 accounted for 16.5% in the study. I don't consider 16% to be a major reason. Please support this statement and explain why it is relevant to your position that ectopic pregnancies cannot be terminated. Lastly, Con says that a woman that gets an abortion is likely to get a second one, or third but the same data shows that a majority of abortions in all states that participated in the study are first time abortions. See Table 19 http://www.cdc.gov... Now, explain your position in light of maternal death especially concerning ectopic pregnancies.

abortion,"I said that it is against the law to kill a person, not an animal. It is important to be clear by what is meant by abortion in today's context. Abortion is the deliberate and direct killing, by whatever means it is carried out, of a human being in the initial phase of his or her existence, at any time from conception to birth. Incomplete abortion: Fetal parts or other products of pregnancy may not be completely emptied from the uterus, requiring further medical procedures. Incomplete abortion may result in infection and bleeding. Numerous scientific studies spanning fifty years have documented a relationship between abortion and breast cancer. Blood clots can also happen and infection. The womb itself can also be damaged while aborting a baby. While the womb is bleeding out, you absolutely have to avoid sleeping with someone so it can't affect the wombs regeneration. The bleeding can go on for weeks and there is severe pain. This one sounds really painful: Cut or torn cervix: The opening of the uterus torn while it is being stretched open to allow medical instruments to pass through and into the uterus. Perforation of the uterus wall: A medical instrument may go through the wall of the uterus. Depending on the severity, perforation can lead to infection, heavy bleeding or both. Surgery is required to repair the uterine tissue, and in the most severe cases hysterectomy may be required. Anesthesia-related complications: As with other surgical procedures, anesthesia increases the risk of complications associated with abortion. There are also long term risks: Rh Immune Globulin Therapy: Genetic material found on the surface of red blood cells is known as the Rh Factor. If a woman and her fetus have different Rh factors, she must receive medication to prevent the development of antibodies that would endanger future pregnancies. LONG-TERM MEDICAL RISKS These are immediate side effects of Abortion: Pain and/or cramping Nausea Vomiting Diarrhea Reaction to anesthetic Headache Dizziness Fever and chills Women may also be very depressed and want to commit suicide after abortion. The woman can also have emotional responses after or while having an abortion. You (plural women who are aborting) may experience a number of different feelings and emotions. Abortion costs up to $800 and there are also other costs for the aftereffects, breast cancer and long term effects. Other immediate consequence of abortion is the risk of damaging a woman's ability to have children. Also: - Denial and repression of emotions. - Avoidance patterns which can lead to isolation. - Emotional numbness. - Violence or aggression towards themselves or others. - Psychosomatic symptoms "" bodily signs of continuing stress: 1. Sleep problems "" insomnia, nightmares, and ""hearing"" a baby crying. 2. Back pain, abdominal cramps, and skin irritations, non-hormonal PMT. 3. Sexual difficulties "" cervical pain, frigidity etc. 4. Eating disorders ""excessive weight gain or loss, anorexia, bulimia. 5. Trouble with relationships and intimacy in general. 6. Self-punishing and self-degrading behaviors (promiscuity, entering abusive relationships, becoming accident-prone). 7. Preoccupation with the abortion child, resulting in anniversary reactions- stress, tension, etc. 8. Many women suffer from depression, turn to drugs or alcohol, and have recurring thoughts of suicide. 9. ""Trauma"" because an unborn baby has been destroyed. There is no doubt that a psychological price is paid. The trauma can sink into the woman's unconscious and it is not harmless and casual. Not only that but research has shown the negative effect the abortion had on the behavior of children of mothers who had abortions. Synopsis: Be aware of what women have to go through after abortion.

abortion,"This is definatley geting interseting however you didnt have a direct link to your information your rebuttal but I managed to find it and would like to counter argue using the same source to even the playing field. 1.""Nearly all abortions take place in the first trimester, when a fetus cannot exist independent of the mother. As it is attached by the placenta and umbilical cord, its health is dependent on her health, and cannot be regarded as a separate entity as it cannot exist outside her womb. 2.The concept of personhood is different from the concept of human life. Human life occurs at conception, but fertilized eggs used for in vitro fertilization are also human lives and those not implanted are routinely thrown away. Is this murder, and if not, then how is abortion murder? 3.Adoption is not an alternative to abortion, because it remains the woman's choice whether or not to give her child up for adoption. Statistics show that very few women who give birth choose to give up their babies - less than 3% of white unmarried women and less than 2% of black unmarried women. 4.Abortion is a safe medical procedure. The vast majority of women - 88% - who have an abortion do so in their first trimester. Medical abortions have less than 0.5% risk of serious complications and do not affect a woman's health or future ability to become pregnant or give birth. 5.In the case of rape or incest, forcing a woman made pregnant by this violent act would cause further psychological harm to the victim. Often a woman is too afraid to speak up or is unaware she is pregnant, thus the morning after pill is ineffective in these situations. 6.Abortion is not used as a form of contraception. Pregnancy can occur even with responsible contraceptive use. Only 8% of women who have abortions do not use any form of birth control, and that is due more to individual carelessness than to the availability of abortion. 7.The ability of a woman to have control of her body is critical to civil rights. Take away her reproductive choice and you step onto a slippery slope. If the government can force a woman to continue a pregnancy, what about forcing a woman to use contraception or undergo sterilization? 8.Taxpayer dollars are used to enable poor women to access the same medical services as rich women, and abortion is one of these services. Funding abortion is no different from funding a war in the Mideast. For those who are opposed, the place to express outrage is in the voting booth. 9.Teenagers who become mothers have grim prospects for the future. They are much more likely to leave of school; receive inadequate prenatal care; rely on public assistance to raise a child; develop health problems; or end up divorced. 10.Like any other difficult situation, abortion creates stress.

abortion,"Abortion should be illegal. Roe v. Wade was incorrectly decided Roe v Wade was a landmark in 1973 and paved the way for abortion to become legal in the US. The decision declared that it was a ""Fundamental Right"" for a woman to have unrestricted access to an abortion in the early weeks of pregnancy and the restricted ability to abort in later weeks. The decision was based on a right to privacy which was declared by the Supreme Court (7-2) to cover the right to terminate a pregnancy. However later Supreme Court Justices have considered that the 1973 Supreme Court went beyond its remit because the US constitution has no guarantees as to privacy and abortion is an issue for legislators not judges. Many US States felt uncomfortable with this decision and have passed laws to require women seeking an abortion to pass through several steps. This can include having a pre-termination ultrasound or attending a counselling session. The pro-choice movement is uncomfortable with these state restrictions and characterizes several States as ""hostile"" to abortions. However these restrictions, when seen in a worldwide context, are not unreasonable. In many countries similar to the US access to abortion is much more difficult; in Ireland, for example, abortion is illegal in all but the direst of circumstances such as where the health of the mother is compromised by the pregnancy. Abortion should be illegal because it denies babies their constitutionally protected right to life When the United States became an Independent Nation the Founding Fathers declared ""All men are created equal""with certain unalienable Rights""Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness"" The 14th Amendment of the US Constitution provides that no person should be ""deprived of life"" without recourse to the due process of the law. At conception a new life comes into being, one with a unique genetic code and the unlimited potential for greatness that is latent in all humans, the development into a baby, then toddler, child, teenager, adult is inevitable. However, aborting a fetus deprives it of life and the ability to enjoy its future liberty and the pursuit of happiness. An abortion deprives a fetus of life without any recourse to due process. The fetus is unable to defend itself. Roe v Wade held that a fetus does not become a person until the moment of birth. This can, however, lead to bizarre situations where doctors in one room of a hospital will be attempting to save the life of a premature baby while doctors in the next door operating theatre are performing an abortion on a healthy fetus of the same age Attempts have been made to persuade law-makers to declare an unborn fetus a person for the purposes of the 14th amendment but they have not, to date, been successful. Since 2010, however, increasing restrictions on access to abortion have been implemented in a number of US States. Abortion should be illegal because it is murder Unborn babies are protected from murder and violence by the federal act ""Unborn Victims of Violence"". The act considers an unborn baby to be a human being and imposes penalties on those who inflict harm on a fetus otherwise than through an abortion. In addition to the Federal Act 38 US states have separate fetal homicide laws. The laws of 23 of those states protect the fetus from the very earliest stages of pregnancy, regardless of viability outside the womb. These laws make it clear that most people find the killing of a fetus to be repugnant and its life worthy of protection. These same laws, however, permit a mother, one of the two people in the world who should be protecting the fetus and putting its interests above anyone else""s, to have an abortion. If it is unacceptable for a stranger to kill a baby why is it acceptable for a mother and her doctors to do so? The father of an unborn baby is considered a victim when it is killed by a third party but has no rights at all to prevent or argue against the mother of his child having an abortion.

abortion,"I accept the challenge offered me by Pro, even though I by and large agree with Pro's argument that abortion-on-demand is not defensible, but that abortion is defensible in rare cases such as rape or the mother's life being in danger, and I never argue against that with which I agree of course (which would make no sense). I agree with the conclusion that abortion should be legal only in specific cases as well, leaving me only one thing I can disagree with here, and that less stringently, that a child should not be killed for the sake of physical abnormality. I presume this was the point Pro wished to debate with me on, since my user page makes clear that I support abortion in the case of rare circumstances such as rape and life of the mother, and possibly even as late as 12 weeks. For the sake of clarity, I will first elucidate my reasoning on abortion in general, and then explain my reasoning on the sole point of disagreement. My Views on Abortion in General My reasoning, as aditionally stated here[1], is as follows: Ultimately, right to privacy is no justification for killing another human being, whether in the privacy of one's own home or own body. Right to choice does not justify choosing to harm another person, and right to one's body cannot justify using that body to harm another person. As such, rights, choices, and privacy are no excuse for harming another person if they are indeed a person, erego, this question revolves necessarily around the issue of personhood. While potential exceptions naturally exist such as rape and life of the mother, since in the case she did not make a sexual decision to be held accountable for, and when her life is endangered by the pregnancy, her life is also at stake, and she should have a choice to save her life (obviously), abortion on demand is ultimately not justifiable when a child is apparently human. Thus, this revolves around the issue of personhood and fetal viability, when a child becomes human, for if it is human, no buzzword argument is sufficient to justify its murder save in such rare circumstances. Furthermore, that such rare circumstances should be raised by those who seek to justify abortion-on-demand evidences that they themselves realize abortion can only be justified in such rare cases, and fallaciously use said cases in an attempt to justify abortion more broadly. When it comes to fetal viability, completed brain cells appear within the first 2 weeks of pregnancy. The heart beats at 3 weeks. Blood flows in the baby's veins separate from the mother's blood at 4 weeks. Brain wave activity occurs at 6 weeks. Based on nervous system development, perception of pain likely begins at 8 weeks. Thumb sucking occurs at 9 weeks. The entire body is sensitive to touch at 10 weeks. Breathing of amniotic fluid and all facial expressions visible (e.g. smiling) at 11 weeks. Crying at 12 weeks, as well as the ability to practice breathing. All senses present including vocal chords at 13 weeks.[2] The earliest recorded successful pregnancy is at 21 weeks[3] even though abortion is allowed in all 9 months of pregnancy.[4] As such, it is logical that a minimum of 18,150 abortions, 1.5% of the 1.21 million annual abortion according to Planned Parenthood's own statistics arm, the Guttmacher Institute, are murder each year, since they occur after the 21st week of pregnancy.[5] So what does public polling show the American people believe? According to Gallup[6] while 62% of Americans support abortion during the first trimester (12 week period of pregnancy), only 24% support abortion in the second trimester, and only 10% for the third trimester. 83% of Americans support abortion when the mother's life is endangered, 82% when the woman's physical health is endangered, 75% when the pregnancy was caused by rape/incest, 61% when the woman's mental health is endangered, 51% when there is evidence the baby may be mentally impaired, 50% when the baby may be physically impaired, and only 36% when the woman or family cannot afford to raise the child. Ultimately, 20% of Americans believe abortion should always be illegal, 39% that it should be legal only in a few circumstances, 13% that it should be legal in most circumstances, 25% that it should always be legal, and 4% hold no opinion. As such, the majority of Americans, over 75%, disagree with abortion after the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, and can recognize that abortion beyond this point is clearly murder. Only 36% believe abortion justifiable when the woman or family can't afford to raise the child. There is nonetheless overwhelming recognition that abortion should be legal in rare cases such as rape or life of the mother. However, it should be pointed out that rape and life of the mother account for less than1% of all abortions[7], at least 13 states had laws allowing abortion before Roe v. Wade in such cases and the number was rapidly growing[8], and virtually all legislation put out in the last two decades by the Pro-Life movement has included exceptions for abortion in said cases. Given this, I believe the courts have incorrectly decided the issue and that the American people should have their voices heard instead as the original judge, Henry Friendly, said in the first major abortion rights case, Hall v. Lefkowitz.[9] As Friendly concluded, ""But the decision what to do about abortion is for the elected representatives of the people, not for three, or even nine, appointed judges."" I believe the correct way forward is to put this issue to a vote and let the American people determine by ballot referendum what the correct viability limit on abortion should be, and in what circumstances is allowed. I have no doubt that they will agree with me, as shown by Gallup polling, and restrict abortion to roughly the 12th week of pregnancy, perhaps a bit earlier, perhaps a bit later, and allow abortion in cases such as rape and life of the mother. Point of Disagreement Ultimately, I argue that abortion should be slightly more restrictive than Con believes, and not allow abortion simply because Down's Syndrome is evident in a pregnant child, or other illnesses for that matter. I believe we should err on the side of caution when potentially taking another human life, and that human life is precious. This is a very controversial issue according to Gallup polling[6] and I recognize that it is a 50% split here, unlike the broader abortion issue where there is broad consensus when human life begins, around 12 weeks, and that abortion-on-demand is immoral. We simply cannot ask unborn children whether they would like to be born, and I question whether we should infer they do not wish to be born because of a disability. I think the reasoning that one should not be born because they are disabled is a dangerous precedent that devalues those with disabilities, whether born or unborn. Furthermore, it allows us to set an arbitrary definition of who is worthy of being born. Does that set precedent for us to expand this to anyone who shows signs of depressin, for example? What if they show signs of dwarfism, a height disability? At what point do we draw the line in deciding the disability is so great they should not be born because of it? Ultimately, I would urge my opponent to reconsider whether such reasoning is preferable to adoption. Sources: [1] http://www.bereawiki.com... [2] http://www.hli.org... http://www.whyprolife.com...

abortion,"I would like to open by stating that I personally do believe life begins at conception and do not agree with abortion being used as a contraception of convenience. However, there are many reasons why abortion should not be made illegal or considered wrong in all circumstances. Abortion for the sake of the mother's health to me seems a simple decision, if the birth of the infant will result in the death of the mother and the child, then how can it be justified to let them both die? Clearly here an abortion is necessary in order to prevent the death of the mother. Secondly abortion where a pregnancy is the result of a crime like rape, incest, or child abuse. No human being should be forced to carry a child for 9 months and then give birth to it, if its conception is the result of such physical and mental trauma. This to me would be a form of mental torture almost unparalleled. Thirdly an abortion where the child of the pregnancy would have an ' unacceptable quality of life' such as cases where the child would have serious physical handicaps, serious genetic problems, serious mental defects. And finally a few other reasons to consider are: poverty, the mother unable to cope with a child (or another child), and the mother being too young to cope with a child. These are all legitimate reasons in favour of abortion. Now to quote you ""Did these innocent lives choose abortion?"" the answer is no, of course. However, an equally plausible question is ""Did these innocent lives choose to be conceived?"" the answer is again, no. The foetus has no choice in its conception or its birth. It lives or dies off the choices of the mother who carries it, and ultimately the decisions must come down to her. By taking away the right of abortion, we take away the right of a woman to choose and this along with the other points I have stated have no place in a modern, secular and equal society.",PRO,"I would like to open by stating that I personally do believe life begins at conception and do not agree with abortion being used as a contraception of convenience.  ...

Abortion will always be an injustificable act of murder. No infant nor unborn child should be denied from her right of life. I totally agree with Mother Teresa that abortion is an act of murder by the mother. Why is it wrong to kill another person if they are allowing abortion. In 1973 the U.S. Court legalized abortion. In the next source you can see about how many women have had abortion. Thus would equal to the amount of murder since 1990, imagine how many innocent lives have been taken. Many people try to justify abortions. For example, rape victims believe their case is justified, but the truth is that by having an abortion you are punishing an innocent unborn child which you could of found a nice family for him to be adopted. By having the abortion you are taking the life of a little person that is growing inside you; when the one you should be punishing is the person who commited that horrible act of rape. Another reason in which they think is justificable is when they are under 18, but the truth is that most of this young girls brought that on them selves. They were having sex unprotected when they shouldn't been having sex. They are just taking the easy way out instead of taking responsability for their act I will end this par of my argument with stating the legal principal that says ""innocent until proven guilty.""

If abortion is illegal, some of them will turn to infanticide, which is truly wrong because they are actually killing someone, unlike abortion. I stated it before, but infanticide rates dropped once abortion became legal. And if they don't kill the baby, their alternative is to simply abandon it. I think we can agree that no child should have to be brought up like this, living their childhood in an orphanage without ever meeting their real parents. And those abandoned children? They will likely turn out to be future criminals. Some may become rapists, impregnating women with a child they don't want in a vicious cycle. In a way, I like to think of abortion as a milder form of euthanasia. Like euthanasia, abortion helps end future suffering but we must keep in mind that it is a fetus, not a human being and therefore not akin to murder. We wouldn't call a seed a tree, so we shouldn't consider an embryo a human. For a final closing statement, let me emphasize a simple yet overlooked fact: Let a mother decide what is best for her child. You wouldn't tell a stranger's children what bedtime they should have. That should be up to the parents to decide. Likewise, we should let the mother decide whether she is ready to have a child or not. If a woman is having an abortion, she has a good reason to and we can't infringe on her right to get one. Thank you for this debate.",PRO,"If abortion is illegal, some of them will turn to infanticide, which is truly wrong because they are actually killing someone, unlike abortion. ...

abortion,"There are many good and bad sides to abortion, But just like everything, There is no black and white, Just a whole range of gray. Abortion is one way that poverty can decrease. Most unplanned teen pregnancies that lead to child birth, Lead to either the child being sent to adoption, Or the family being sent into poverty. That is because raising a child is expensive and some parents are just not mature enough. I would not want to live in a world where children are living their entire sad lives in poverty instead of less children living in more richness. Abortion also has its consequences. The parents who get an abortion are usually called out by their friends for killing their own child. That alone is enough to discourage abortion for most. That leads us to the ethical values of abortion. Even though abortion is logical in every way, The rules of ethics say that killing an unborn child is bad because it is like killing a child. Just like how Thanos (from Avengers: Infinity War) wanted to kill half the universe so that the other half can live a life filled with happiness, Abortion prevents entire families from going broke and allows them to have children later in life that can live a rich life.

abortion,"I will first argue why abortion is wrong, then I will respond to your arguments. Why abortion is morally wrong Firstly, abortion intentionally kills a human foetus. We know that a human foetus is a human being. We also know that murder is the intentional killing of a human being. Therefore abortion is murder. Murder is morally wrong * Therefore abortion is morally wrong As I do not know which premises (if any) you dispute, so I will justify the premises that you dispute in round 2. Response to Pro's arguments Your main argument is that abortion would prevent a child from living a life that could be miserable. However, in what world do we have the right to murder people against their will if we subjectively deem their lives not worth living? With your logic, we would be perfectly justified in walking into an orphanage and killing all the orphans. You say that abortion would reduce child abuse, but that""s replacing one evil with another. Since when do we kill people to prevent them from being abused? Furthermore, the majority of orphans to do not suffer child abuse; so if abortion was encouraged instead of adoption then the majority of orphans would be murdered despite them not actually suffering abuse at all. Why should the majority be killed in order to reduce the suffering of the minority? ""17,900,000 will never fin a home , would you want that for a kid?"" A childhood in an orphanage is a lot better than no childhood (and adulthood) at all. Even if we deem that it is not, why should we have the authority to deny these human beings the chance in life? We don""t see many suicidal orphans, which is surely testament to the fact that a childhood in an orphanage is preferable to death. ""What's better putting a kid threw that ? Or doing what is best for the parent and child."" Abortion =/= doing what is best for the parent and child. Why? Because killing the child is not doing what's best for it. I agree that it isn't nice to be brought up in an orphanage, but is it better than death?

trump,"Firstly i want to thank my opponent for challenging me to this debate and wish them good luck. In my view Donald Trump would be an effective president for the USA. His generally hands off approach to world wide conflicts is in my view a positive thing. Yes he is negative about Russia, China and Iran but it is fair to say these three states do not currently have good relations with the USA anyway, so his policy towards them is no significant change to the previous administration. It is also fair to say these three countries have acted unethically in a variety of ways such as human rights abuses and acting with military aggression. It's fair to say they deserve some criticism. The border wall with Mexico is in my view a great idea. Illegal immigration is a key problem for the USA and if Mexico could be pursuaded to contribute towards the cost of its construction that would be an excellent economic and political result for the USA. What I think makes trump the strongest presidential candidate is the fact that he is not a career politician and has had an enormously succesful career in business. It is clear trump knows how to run a business and knows how a governments actions affect business first hand. Trump is one of the cleverist business brains in the US and surely tapping into that knowledge would be great for the USA. The fact the economy is in a perilous position with national debt and the national budget deficits at record high levels shows the current economic approach is not working.

trump,"Before I jump in, I do not support Trump. I would like to sort of break this down. Yes, he has done several no good deeds, however, I believe the media amplifies his negatives, while shying away from the things he""s done well up to this point. First of all, jobs have been coming in at a continuing growing rate. He has already surpassed 1 million jobs created since early April (currently stands at 1.7 million). The employment rate continues to stay relatively low, at around 4.1%. There is a 62.7% labor participation rate, which is starting to make a comeback from the recession in 2008. There""s also been 159k manufacturing jobs created. Overall, jobs have been growing at a slow and steady rate. Also, the stock market has been doing very well under President Trump.

Of course, it""s not that much of an accomplishment, since it has been growing at a continuous rate, but the fact that it keeps climbing is always good. Overall, I believe Trumps cons outweigh his pros, but the government is still holding up, growing in fact. And trust me, there have been several presidents that were worse than Trump. There were several presidents who owned slaves, like George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison. There was Nixon who was part of the Watergate scandal, which eventually forced him to resign. Many more presidents doing way more bad things than Trump.

I'm not very tolerant of plagiarism, and I am certain that it's against the rules of the website, but for the purpose of the debate, I will continue debating. However, if pro continuously plagarizes entire articles, I may make the decision to stop debating, seeing as I'll only be debating against writers of various articles, rather than Pro. Outline I. Trump's ""Successful"" Businesses II. Trump on Climate Change III. The ""Trump Effect"" IV. Sources I. Trump's ""Successful"" Businesses Any successful businessman can run into trouble from time-to-time, whether it's making a mistake that may hurt his investments, or having suits filed against him. Trump is regarded as one of the most successful businessmen in America. However, his history of businesses and the source of his wealth, only prove that he is incapable of running his own businesses. In fact, an article from ""Business Insider,"" claims that the New York Times analyzed 61 of Trump's projects and deals from the 2000s to 2012. The researchers and analysists found that around 40 of those deals were either failures or had problems which deemed them as fruitless, while only a mere 21 of them were successes. That means that approximately 66% of his deals were unsuccessful (S1). The Business Insider article continues by providing the list of which projects were immediate failures, which ones had problems, and which were successful. His shortcomings in business are also apparent in the 3,500 suits filed against him, ranging from skirmishes with his casino patrons to lawsuits regarding multi-million dollar real estate deals (S2). ""Call it the art of the bad deal, one created by the arrogance and recklessness of a businessman whose main talent is self-promotion."" -Kurt Eichenwald Many people, including myself, believe that Trump's ""success"" was a result of family ties, especially his father's lucrative real-estate business, and his shameless self-promotion, such as that controversy with his ""small hands"" where Trump responded to an article saying he has ""big hands,"" with a gold pen.Kurt Eichenwald, writer of the News Week Article, ""Trump's Many Business Failures, Explained,"" expands upon this idea that ""Trump boasted when he announced his candidacy last year that he had made his money “the old-fashioned way,” but he is no Bill Gates or Michael Bloomberg, self-made billionaires who were mavericks, innovators in their fields. Instead, the Republican nominee’s wealth is Daddy-made. Almost all of his best-known successes are attributable to family ties or money given to him by his father,"" (S3). Donald Trump has tried to run his businesses apart from real estate, though to no avail. Trump, owner of the line of ""Trump Casinos,"" has amassed four bankruptcies. He claims that he had ""nothing to do"" with the failure of the business, despite owning 28% of the stock in the companies. He has also pitched some other business ideas that he put into action. Like his casinos, these ideas failed, terribly. Trump Airlines was a private luxury airline company started in 1988. Due to the lack of profits, the company closed in 1992. Trump also unleashed a brand of his own vodka and steaks called ""Trump Vodka,"" and ""Trump Steaks."" Trump Vodka was made in 2006. The company stopped production in 2011 due to a lack of profit and interest. Trump Steaks began in 2007 but closed down in 2012 for over 51 health code violations, including serving five-month-old duck. That's some ""Trump-quality"" cuisine! Trump attributes the health violations his managers for ""lazily hiring terrible cooks."" The list of Trump's business failures goes on, with things such as Trump the Game, Trump Magazines, Trump University, Trump Mortgage, GoTrump.com, Trump International Tower of Chicago, etc (S4). His inability to manage his own businesses not only proves that he is incapable of administrating his own businesses, he is incapable of building a business empire, he has a lack in priorities for his business affairs, and when all else fails, he searches for a scapegoat. II. Trump on Climate Change Pro claims that Trump will be ""saving billions"" by cutting Environmental Protection, and while that's all well and good for taxpayers, we will still allow climate change to threaten our world. Not only that, but Rex Tillerson, Trump's appointed cabinet member as the Secretary of State, has the authority to remove environmental regulations on businesses, allowing them to dispose of their wastes improperly, contaminating drinking water, killing life in nature and adding to our immense pollution. And the likelihood of Tillerson doing so is high since he is associated with ExxonMobil, a company that provides gas and oil. Cutting environmental regulations on ExxonMobil will mean that they can dump their wastes anywhere. Additionally, if we neglect the environment, then we will run into more health concerns. If water is polluted, then cities, and maybe even states, may have to pay to get clean water. With the threat of global warming, our water supply may be greatly decreased because of the lesser amount of snow pack. And if the air is polluted, then we will need to pay immense amounts to clear the air, though there is not much that can do so. We will run into more health concerns by ignoring the environment, and we may have to pay a large amount for reparations and to buy purified water, which may accumulate for more than the government spending to protect the environment. III. The ""Trump Effect"" Trump's words to not highlight concerns of ""equality"" or ""tolerance."" His talk of banning Muslims from entering the country, and the provocation of violence do not make him the type of person capable of inspiring and bringing America together. I'm certain that no rational person wants to hear their president saying ""‘[Mexicans] are rapists. And some, I assume, are good people,"" or ""I will bomb the s*** out of them!"" (S5). America should have a confident president who can inspire the masses, and point America in the right direction, not an egostatic man who talks of himself so highly, that people are not sure if he's running for President, or for the Guiness World Record for the man with the highest ego in America. The ""Trump Effect"" is the belief that Trump's campaign is making an impression on juviniles and inspiring closeted bigots to unite and fight for their racist beliefs. In a document written by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), the SPLC claims that ""[Trump] is producing an alarming level of fear and anxiety among children of color and inflaming racial and ethnic tensions in the classroom. Many students worry about being deported. Other students have been emboldened by the divisive, often juvenile rhetoric in the campaign. Teachers have noted an increase in bullying, harassment and intimidation of students whose races, religions or nationalities have been the verbal targets of candidates on the campaign trail."" In fact, mroe than two thirds of teacher reported that students, mainly immigrants and Muslims, have expressed concerns about what might happen to their families if Trump is elected president. More than one thirds of teachers reported that they observed an increse in anti-Muslim or anti-immigrant sentiment. A teacher from a middle school with a large population of African-American Muslims said “My students are terrified of Donald Trump. They think that if he’s elected, all black people will get sent back to Africa,” (S6). Donald Trump's campaign and public harassment is clearly making an impact on the populus in the worst ways possible, promoting bigotry and violence and bullying. He, through his words, clearly shows that he is incapable of being a president who can unite the masses. IV. Sources S1) http://www.businessinsider.com... S2) http://www.usatoday.com...

trump,"I have my own contentions with the President Elect, but these contentions don't involve the usual baseless chants of ""racism"", ""sexism"", or any of the other isms that the political left seems to use in lieu of an actual argument. While this type of rhetoric and general lack of an argument is abundant today, my opponent in this debate can't even seem to muster this minimal amount dialectic ability. First, my opponent states that Trump ""will cause wars in the future."" Other than being a complete lack of an argument, this statement falls flat from the beginning. Trump, like every single presidential candidate, has expressed the need to address ISIS and other extremist groups in the middle east, often with military action. Now I'm not sure if my opponent was a Hillary Clinton supporter, but I'm curious why he's afraid of Trump ""starting wars"". Unfortunately my opponent hasn't provided any substance for his argument, which is extremely telling. In complete contrast, let's look at his opponent in the general election. Mrs. Clinton openly called the hacking of DNC and other Democratic emails ""acts of war"" from Russia, saying that such acts should be treated ""just like any other attack"", and that ""we will be ready with serious political, economic and military responses."" All of this was in response to the hacking of emails, which may or may not have been committed by Russia. You have LITERAL threats of war from the Democratic nominee, yet all we've heard is this nonsense from mainstream media outlets claiming Trump is the warmonger that we all should fear. This rhetoric seems to be parroted by my opponent, which should enlighten the audience as to the level of sophistry in his ""argument"". Are you saying that Trump is going to start wars, even though he's publicly criticized neo-con warmongers from the past? Do you think that he is more hawkish on foreign policy than Mrs. Clinton? The bottom line is that this election provided us with limited options, but if we can take ONE thing from the election, it's that we got the LEAST hawkish candidate out of the two. If my opponent's concerns are truly about future wars, perhaps he should be thanking the US for electing Trump over Clinton. Next, my opponent claims ""[Trump] will also probably get assassinated which I think MAY be true ... and will corrupt the US even more which is just stupid."" Aside from being a horrendous run-on sentence, this statement is again void of any reason or supporting evidence. To start, let's just examine the funding for each presidential candidate in the most recent election, if for nothing more than a comparison. Trump, a political outsider, raised a total of $306,930,980 in both candidate committee money and ""outside money"" for his campaign. Clinton raised $687,261,894, well over twice the amount of Trump. The majority of Clinton's donations came in the form of ""Large Individual Contributions"", totaling roughly $267 MILLION dollars, while this same category comprised a minority of individual contributions to the Trump campaign, and totaled only 14% of what Clinton raised. It's a hard case to make that Trump of all people will ""corrupt the US even more"", when the man isn't even taking money from potential ""corruptors"". In complete contrast, his opponent was taking FAR more money from all sorts of sources. If the argument is that a Trump presidency will lead in more corruption, then proof needs to laid out. My opponent has failed to provide an ounce of evidence, and unfortunately for him, the facts seem to suggest the complete opposite of his position. The largest super PAC for the Clinton campaign, Priorities USA Action, raised nearly $176 million. This same Super PAC also collaborated with other Democratic operatives, and members tied to both the super PAC and the Clinton campaign are on camera admitting to paying mentally ill people to riot and cause problems at Trump events. The largest industry as far as donation to the Clinton campaign was the ""Securities & Investment"" industry, aka the investment banking industry. If we're to believe even an ounce of progressive/leftist rhetoric, this is essentially the seal of corruption on the Clinton campaign. In contrast, the largest industry contributions to Trump was from the ""Retired"" industry, and it amounted to just a fraction of what Clinton received from investment firms. One of the largest points of the Trump campaign is the simplification of the tax code, something that would level the playing field between large and small firms, and foster competition. This is not something that large corporations want, as they won't gain much from such a tax overhaul. Again, if the argument is that Trump is going to corrupt the US, then the burden of proof rests on my opponent, and he has failed to provide that proof. The evidence shows that all the big money flowed AWAY from Mr. Trump. In his last piece, my opponent manages to completely contradict nearly everything he said prior. He states that, ""[Trump] does not have the proper intelligence of a president to even have his hands on the nuclear codes and, I do believe that. To finish off Trump has ONLY business experience..."" I don't think my opponent quite understands politics or the real world for that matter. Most presidential candidates don't inherently possess ""the proper intelligence... to have his hands on the nuclear codes."" This intelligence that you speak of is highly guarded (unless you're Hillary Clinton). Said intelligence is only revealed once that candidate is in office, and there are a plethora of advisers and agencies whose sole purpose is dealing with this intelligence. It would be a massive breach of security, much like Hillary's email scandal, if Trump were to have all the intelligence available to a US president. My opponent is afraid of Trump having the nuclear codes, but in order for us to take these concerns seriously, he needs to address the points I brought up in the beginning, which he cannot do because he created a 1 round debate. Trump has condemned the Iraq war, and has expressed concerns about military intervention. His most prominent hawkish tendencies show up when discussing ISIS, which if my opponent hasn't noticed, is already waging wars with or without the US. As far as having no political experience, you would think that this would be a plus for someone so apparently concerned with corruption. Corruption is primarily centered around career politicians raising tons of money from big businesses. Trump, a political outsider, was out-funded by over 100% compared to his opponent (Hillary Clinton), and his campaign funding consisted of a significant amount of his own money. Aside from raising MUCH less than his opponent, or even the last few Democratic AND Republican candidates, Mr. Trump has claimed that he will refuse his government paycheck as POTUS, which is something that should be taken into account when discussing the character of Mr. Trump. In closing, my opponent has failed to support his position even in the slightest. His post seems more like some regurgitated nonsense from Occupy Democrats than a coherent set of arguments. Trump, while not a complete dove on foreign policy, is certainly one of the least hawkish presidents in recent history. He has raised a limited amount of funds for his campaign, which completely contradicts the claims of corruption. And the man""s lack of political experience should be seen as a plus versus a negative, ESPECIALLY in the eyes of someone like my opponent who is oh so concerned with corruption and US foreign policy. At this point, claims of racism and sexism might have held more water than my opponents lack of an argument. http://opensecrets.org... http://thehill.com... http://ijr.com...",CON,"Trump, a political outsider, raised a total of $306,930,980 in both candidate committee money and ""outside money"" for his campaign. ... http://opensecrets.org... http://thehill.com... http://ijr.com...",219
trump,"I'll be honest, that was an interesting video, however, I still like him. Here's what I got from the video: 1. He's changed his opinion on multiple issues. I don't see anything wrong with that, if anything, I think he was smart to become a Republican in recent years. Look, times change meaning that a policy that would have worked years ago might not work today and a party that may have appeared favorable once may not appear as favorable now. In 2000, when Trump ran for president under the Reform Party, he believed in universal healthcare as an option. The idea that he maintains that belief, despite what the video said, is ridiculous. In early 2015, he brought up the idea that the government should start making deals with hospitals to help low income Americans. Later, a spokesperson (not Trump himself) stated that Trump would be open to a universal / market-based system that would open up a variety of choices. Today, his official healthcare plan affirms that he supports a 100% free market system, where insurance companies must compete nationwide - the exact opposite of universal healthcare. 2. He's donated to and supported the Bill and Hillary in the past. That makes Trump living proof that we have corrupt politicians in Washington; in fact, that's what brought down primary rivals like Sen. Rand Paul (who accepted money from Trump). The video starts going into conspiracy theory-mode; it theorizes that because Trump donated to them, he secretly supports them and is part of an elaborate plot to make Hillary our next president. First of all, there's no evidence. Second of all, if donating money means working for someone, wouldn't Trump also be working for Rand Paul? And wouldn't he have refrained from calling out Hillary for accepting his donation? 3. He's not extremely religious. I'm okay with that. He said that he does not ask God for forgiveness, and then the video pulls up Bible quote after Bible quote - but who really follows every word of the Bible? If you did, you'd be a criminal; the Bible says that we should stone our children if they are disobedient - which is considered murder, and murder is a crime. The video is basically anti-Trump propaganda with little to no factual information. SOURCES: http://www.politifact.com...-/ https://www.donaldjtrump.com...

trump,"As you so kindly asked, I will tell you most of the times Trump has been racist, In the year 1992, Trump's casinos transferred black dealers off certain tables to please racist dealers. They were fined $200, 000. In 2004, Trump fired a black contestant from, ""The Apprentice"" for being ""over-educated"". In 2015, Trump called immigrants who were Mexicans, ""rapists"" who are, ""bringing crime and drugs"" to the United States of America. Listen, I get it, ""Immigration is illegal"", Trust me I've heard it one too many times. THEY'RE STILL HUMANS. They deserve a chance at a better life. Obama was making a difference for immigrants. Then Trump came and just discarded all of Obama's hard work. In 2010, Trump agreed to segregate Muslims in lower Manhattan. In 2016, During his campaign, Trump constantly retweeted tweets from neo-nazis and white supremacists. Which, In your argument, You stated he condemned. In 2019, Trump tweeted that four colored congresswomen should go back to where they come from. In 2015, Trump wanted a, ""ban on all Muslims entering the U. S. "" Trump is extremely misogynistic. In September 2015, Trump made a statement about Clary Fiorina, Which stated, ""Can you imagine that the face of our next president. . . She's a woman. . . "" In April 2015, Trump made a very offensive statement about Hilary Clinton which stated, ""If Hilary Clinton can't satisfy her husband, What makes her think she can satisfy America? "" In August 2012, Trump said about Arianna Huffington, ""Unattractive inside and out. I fully understand why her former husband left her for a man --- he made a good decision. "" In October 2007, He made extremely bold claims saying, ""I do own Miss Universe. I do own Miss USA. "" That's extremely ignorant because men don't ""own"" women. We are free and we are independent. Trump is a pathetic excuse for a man. Trump has been accused of sexual assault many times. Well, Over twenty-five times. The information has been released of his sexual assault and rape against minors which is disturbing. Since you want proof. . . ""Michael Parker, 10-years old, Oral rape, Mar-a-Lago, Palm Beach, FL, 1992. Trump paid his parents a $3 million settlement"" to keep quiet. I'll state a few more. ""Maria Olivera, 12-years old. Her family was paid $16 million to settle allegations of forcible intercourse occurring in Mar-a-Lago, Palm Beach, FL, 1993. "" He PAID off families to keep quiet about their children getting raped. It's sickening. I feel ill just thinking about it. Last one, ""Rebecca Conway, 13-years old, Intercourse and oral sex, Trump Vineyard Estates, Charlottesville, VA, 2012, 5 million dollar settlement. "" This information isn't very popular because Trump has kept it from reaching news channels and big social media platforms until now. That information was discovered by investigative-journalist in D. C. Whose name was not provided. The subjects are still under investigation by the Department of Justice. Trump and his lawyer, Michael Cohen, Who helped him, ""fix"" things and pay off the families are being investigated for these crimes. There are accusations that Trump allegedly sexually assaulted many women he worked with and they spoke out about it. Of course, Trump denied every single claim of him sexually assaulting anyone, Despite the evidence. Abolishing the second amendment would not be horrible. It would make America a much safer place for everyone in it. Proven by England. England banned guns in all households, It is illegal in England to possess a firearm. After the Dunblane massacre, England abolished guns and since then, Gun violence is extremely rare in the U. K. Gun violence in the U. S. Has taken so many lives and it needs to go. There are many other ways to protect yourself, Guns are deadly. You want to talk about bills? How about the ones he REVOKED? Here's one, ""Trump reversed an interpretation of the Civil Rights Act that protected transgender workers. "" HE created an unsafe environment for the LGBTQ+ community. He, ""Reversed a ban on civil forfeiture"" Which is unconstitutional because it takes away our 4th amendment rights. Yes, Trump has done many things that have not helped our environment in any way. He blocked the Clean Power Plan which Obama has put in place to focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. The administration reported that they would revoke it entirely. He reversed a rule that Obama had made for a ban on drilling for oil in the Arctic. Whi9ch Obama had put in place to benefit our environment, Which he truly cared about. Reversed a ban on plastic bottles at national parks. Plastic is a main reason why our planet is dying. That ban was put in place to help the environment. He repealed a ban on lead bullets which Obama put in place because the poison in the bullet could harm wildlife. Canceled the order that limited how many sea animals could be trapped or killed in fishing nets. That order could've seriously increased the marine life numbers. He repealed a rule that banned dumping waste from mining into streams. Marine pollution is a HUGE problem. If the ocean dies, The human race will become extinct. He repealed a rule allowing transgenders to serve in the military. That is very discriminatory and goes against our 14th amendment rights! Now you cannot tell me that when Trump repealed that rule, He was in the right. He repealed 72 documents explaining the rights of disabled students in education. He revoked federal protections of transgender students in American education. He began the process of undoing the Johnson Amendment. Which you should already know what that is, So I shouldn't have to explain it. I gave several facts about how Trump has harmed this country in so many ways.

trump,"Trump has only caused chaos for this country and hasn't made a significant impact that was good. His campaigns in 2016 claimed that, ""He would make America great again"" Our citizens trusted his statement but he lied and took advantage of our trust. Many Americans had made the mistake of voting for him and many have vowed to not vote for him again. I believe Biden has the upper hand in this election, I believe if Biden wins, He will make this country better than Trump claimed he would. Biden has claimed he would help fix climate change, Which has been an ongoing, Environment threatening problem. That Trump has done NOTHING about. Global warming is one of the biggest threats to not just our country, BUT THE WHOLE WORLD. Yet, Our president could care less. Also, When Trump was elected, He had very little political history which should've been a sign that he knew nothing about government. It's almost like citizens voted blindly. Many accusations had been made that Trump was bribing people to vote for him. To be completely and utterly honest, I completely believe that Trump would make such an irrational decision like that. He's ignorant. He is also racist. Back in 2018 I believe, He made many racist comments about Hispanics and yes he did receive extreme backlash but that should be a CLEAR sign to people from everywhere in America that he doesn't deserve the title of ""president"" Now people who have worked hard in their political career, Like Biden, Were just tossed aside as if they hadn't worked hard. Trump grew up and built his career with daddy's money. He didn't work a single day for what he has now, Everything was basically handed to him. He has earned the right to take ""The worst president"" title from James Buchanan. He is the worst president out of the 45 presidents before him. Now that's a record to beat. It's pathetic that his impeachment didn't pass through. That decision would've saved this country a lot of havoc. He has recently ordered police to harm peaceful protesters, For George Floyd's death. Trump's lazy and poor decisions is the reason of Floyd's death. Many events have happened like Floyd's death in the past four years and Trump has done nothing about it. He instead sat there in the white house hiding. Recently, He had many peaceful protesters gathered in front of the white house tear gassed so he do a photo op. He uses his power for selfish needs, He is a selfish man. He made very misogynistic claims in the past, Which still wasn't enough for everyone to see how much of a bad man he was. He is an embarrassment to this country, He is an embarrassment to our presidency. No wonder other countries look down upon us. Receipts have been released of Trump working with Jeffery Epstein to human traffic. So not only is he misogynistic and racist. He's also a rapist. If anyone wants to go through what Trump has put us through in these past four years for another four years, Please think about the facts and the evidence.

trump,"I can give you 14 reasons why Donald Trump is going to be a great president 1 . He has high standards Trump gets it. He believes in American exceptionalism, he""s committed to education, an he demands high performance. After all, he has been know to fire anyone that doesn""t meet his high standards. Talk about efficiency. 2. He""ll be tough on ISIS No one will be tougher on ISIS than Donald Trump. Mostly because Islamic terrorism is eating up large portions of the Middle East and they""ve become rich. They even built a hotel making themselves a direct competitor of Trump Hotel. 3. He can""t be bought Trump has a confidence and a self-assured, powerful personality that is perfectly suited for politics. Unlike other politicians who tend to be swayed by lobbyists and special interests, Trump is his own special interest and is unlikely to give that power away to anyone but Trump. 4. He knows how to build an empire Trump is extremely rich, obviously, and his track record for financial success proves that he knows how to build a successful empire. With the U.S. trillions of dollars in debt, this is the sort of leader that might be able to turn it all around. 5. He""s an American first Trump""s loyalty will only be to America and Americans""not any political party, special interest group or foreign entity. Like his slogan reads, ""Make America great again!"" 6. He has his priorities straight He has emphasized beliefs in free enterprise and a strong military. He repeatedly highlights his acumen for success, his ability to get things done, and understanding of finances 7. He""ll bring people together He loves all races""well, maybe not Mexicans as he referenced them as ""criminals, drug dealers, rapists"" but we digress; As a president who respects most races, he will hopefully alleviate the recent tensions between police officials and the African American community. 8. He speaks the truth Trump isn""t politically correct. He isn""t afraid to say what he thinks, and he can certainly voice an opinion. If he has an issue with you, he will say it to your face. It""d be nice to have a politician in office with that level of transparency. 9. He""ll keep nuclear weapons out of the wrong hands Trump said it himself""he will single-handedly stop Iran from getting nuclear weapons. We aren""t entirely sure how, but he""s Trump; Anything is possible. 10. Because he said so Why would Trump make the best president of all time? Because he said so. ""I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created, I tell you that. I""ll bring back our jobs from China, from Japan, from Mexico and from so many places. I""ll bring back our money. "" Sadly, the American dream is dead. But if I get elected president, I will bring it back bigger and better and stronger than ever before, and we will make America great again."" 11. He""ll Investigate Hillary Donald Trump promised during a presidential debate that, should he win the election, he will instruct a Special Prosecutor to look into Hillary Clinton""s past, and investigate the FBI investigation that concluded it will not press charges against Clinton. This is despite the fact that Hillary deleted 33,000 emails after receiving a subpoena from the United States government. Democrat or Republican, government corruption is something we should all be working against, and wouldn""t it be great to see Trump start prosecuting politicians who have gotten rich from politics, and broken the law on multiple occasions? Love Trump or hate him, he""s going to lock up people who truly deserve it. 12. He""ll Impose a Hiring Freeze on the Federal Workforce Trump also has beef with how the government just seems to be constantly expanding and employing more people. So, instead of hiring new people to work in government offices, Trump is proposing that nobody is able to get a job in the federal workforce for at least the next four years. This will of course not include people being employed in the US Armed Forces or similarly necessary services, but it will mean that government offices that spend half their time rubber stamping offices won""t be getting any new members of staff any time soon. 13. He""ll Save Billions on UN Climate Change Programs The United States currently pays the United Nations billions of dollars every year to assist with their climate change programs. If you""re concerned about global warming then this probably isn""t the policy for you, but if you""re concerned about the fact that the United States now owes almost 20 trillion dollars "" and almost 10 of which have been added in the last eight years under President Obama "" then this is definitely a policy for you. 14. He""ll Ban Foreign Lobbyists Fundraising for US Elections Hillary and the Democratic campaign team are implying lately that Trump is involved with Putin, and that Russia is having an influence on the election. However, Trump seems to be the only candidate talking about how important it is that foreign governments and lobbyists don""t have any power over US elections. Hillary, for instance, has been taking millions from corrupt governments for years "" and even raking in millions from Saudi Arabia, a country which doesn""t hold women in high regard at all.

Such as the lowest black unemployment rate thus far, First step act, Lowest poverty rates, Opportunity zones that lowers taxes for low income areas, School choice, GUARANTEED funding for historically black colleges and universities(most funding than any other president ever), He has condemned the KKK and white supremacy many times, Undoing the horrendous 1994 crime bill that incarcerated blacks at an unbelievable rate that Joe Biden voted for and Biden said he was PROUD of! Also your whole argument is that he is a bad president because he does not care about climate change. There is MUCH MUCH more to being president than Climate Change however since you are saying he could care less, Here are some bills that have been signed to protect the environment. Save Our Seas Act, Earlier this year, President Trump signed the largest public lands legislation in a decade, Designating 1. 3 million new acres of wilderness, To prevent devastating forest fires, President Trump took action to improve management of forests under Federal supervision and worked with State and local leaders to do the same. Trump Administration has prioritized funding for environmental restoration projects in the Florida Everglades.

Can you name one case where he has been found guilty of rape? By your theory than Joe Biden is a rapist too. Biden has been accused of rape 8 times! Also those ""receipts"" from the Epstein and Trump case have been out for 5 years. The defendant in the Trump and Epstein case admitted to making the whole thing up. Trump never visited Epstein""s island but you know who did former president Bill Clinton. Just to show how much Trump is against this he has made sex trafficking punishable by death.

Now to address George Floyd's death. Please cite your source for ""He has recently ordered police to harm peaceful protesters"" because this is false he is talking about violent protesters and looters! He put the case at the top of all FBI cases. Also you say this is Trumps fault however you do not name one single bill or law that has been passed to prove this! However I have named one such as the 1994 crime bill that Biden voted for! Also you just say he is ""sexist"" but you do not put ANY evidence to prove this.

Even if trump largely figurehead / puppet, he b still in da face o america 2 da ppl o da world. I don trust him in dat capacity. http://fortune.com... https://mic.com... See, da issue be dat trump may not be da problem. If trump turns out to not be supa competent an ends up relyin on his advisors to make decisions, it means dat republicans, wit a majority in all three branches of government, will be able to crank out their favored legislation (i.e. protectin discrimination against lgbtq people). An even if trump be mostly a figurehead, he still has a lot of powah as a figurehead, by justifying/normalizin racism an misogyny. as fo racism, im fairly sho dat derrs evidence dat several o his businezzes discrimin8d somewhat based on race, an his comments about a judge bein unfit 2 judge a case he was involved in cuz he was mexican cant b interpreted as anythin but racist. da izzue b dat if he does end up relyin on his advisors (aka mike pence, whos pretty much defined by his homophobia), he wil allow anti-lgbtq legislation 2 b pazzed (unlike obama, who ve2ed it), i doubt he cares nuff about lgbtq ppl 2 ve2 legislation an git on da bad side o congrezz. contrary 2 trumps racist st8ments, islam b not inherently a violent religion, radical islam b.

Now, dis judge is o mexican heritage. Im buildin a wall, k? im buildin a wall. I think he shud recuse himself. Hes o mexican heritage. And hes very proud o it."" http://www.politifact.com...

Either trump is sayin dat his policys r anti-mexican enuff dat any1 with mexican heritage mite b biased against him, and thus shouldnt b allowed 2 decide in his cases (note dat teh same argument cud then b used 2 say dat a white person wud b biased in favor o trump), or hes sayin dat mexicans in general r biased against him fo sum other reason.

Meh n mah buds already no dat many racist groups liek da KKK gots been supportin trump, an trumps azzociation wit racism an bigotry will encourage his racist an bigot supportaz.

trump,"I would like to thank my opponent for creating this debate. I am against Trump's policies. I accepted this debate, because of the definition that was offered for good. Good- to be desired or approved of, having the qualities required for a particular role I will believe that me and my opponent should stick to this definition throughout the debate. As far as I am concerned, Trump has the qualities of being a president. If the definition of good(benefits and harms) was that, than I would not have accepted this debate. No-one should underestimate Donald Trump's intelligence. General Election Trump: Donald Trump is changing his views for the general election. This tells me that Donald Trump does not truly believe in what he has claimed during the Republican Primary. Lets look at the stances. -Trump has stated that he is look forward to increasing the minimum wage. -Trump has stated that he wants to start taxing hedge fund managers which is a step in the right direction. -Trump has also flirted with the idea of changing his policy towards immigrants and Muslims. -Trump has also stated that America should not be involved in Syria. -Trump does not want to cut Social Security spending. -Trump agrees with Obamacare. -Trump is against the outsourcing of jobs. -Trump is for transgender/gay rights. ---------- This tells me that Donald Trump is not as radical or dumb as people have made him out to be. He is from New York, and has been very liberal for a very long time. One can see in the 1980s to 1990s that he held liberal positions. In this election, we are trying to pick out the which one is the lesser of two evils. We already know where Hilary Clinton stands. We already know that she is a basic right winger economically, and on foreign policy wise. Donald Trump has gone to the left, and there is evidence that suggests he is liberal. ----------------------------------------------- My opponent has claimed in his case that Donald Trump appeared to be anti-establishment. He has also claimed that Trump is doing this because the base likes it. I will go one step further than my opponent. Donald Trump is the establishment. Evidence: Donald Trump has had many encounters with the establishment, and has tried to court them. ----------------------------- Two separate sources close to Trump""s campaign added that his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, reached out to Adelson""s political adviser, Andy Abboud, to set up a face-to-face July meeting in Las Vegas between their bosses. Adelson later backed out. And last month, when POLITICO reported that Adelson was leaning toward supporting the GOP presidential campaign of Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, whose hawkish foreign policy views align closely with Adelson""s, Trump lashed out at the senator and his potential patron. ""Sheldon Adelson is looking to give big dollars to Rubio because he feels he can mold him into his perfect little puppet. I agree!"" Trump tweeted. ------------------------------------------- A similar pattern unfolded with Singer, a politically influential New York hedge fund billionaire who also is an ardent Israel hawk. Back in March, when Trump was still publicly toying with running for president, Kushner reached out to one of Singer""s representatives to try to broker a meeting between the representative and Trump, according to a source familiar with the interaction. Kushner indicated that Trump was laying the groundwork for a campaign and suggested Singer""s representative might want to hear about the plans. But a few days after Singer declared his support for Rubio on Friday, Trump went on the attack. -------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Trump campaign sought access to the political and public policy network helmed by the Koch brothers. Trump""s aides detailed his policy positions for the Kochs and their donors in a survey put together by Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, the group that coordinates the Koch network and hosts its twice-a-year donor gatherings. But when Trump was not among the five candidates invited to the Koch donor gathering in August at which the survey was distributed to donors, he unleashed some serious snark at his rivals who were included R13; Rubio, Walker, Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz and Carly Fiorina. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- All of this evidence supports the fact that Donald Trump is an establishment candidate. He is manipulating his voters. That is basically what a lot of politicians do during elections. Trump has perfected that art, and was able to beat 15 candidates at it. There is also more evidence that further reveals how establishment Donald Trump really is. Paul Manafort is one of Trump's top aides. There has been a tape that has been leaked which proves that Trump is very establishment. In an effort to build a bridge between the GOP establishment and Trump, Manafort calms down GOP worries, and says that Trump is playing a character. He is trying to complete the first phase which was to win the Republican primary. He will re-invent himself after he wins the Republican primary. I will link the video in the sources part of the case. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- Will Trump be a good president? Good-to be desired or approved of, having the qualities required for a particular role President- the elected head of a republican state He does have the qualities of getting the particular role. He has shown that he has been able to manipulate a large group of people, and make them believe that he is something he is not. Millions of people today think that Trump is anti-establishment. That is the exact opposite of what he is. In his book(The Art of the Deal), he says that being in the public eye is always a good thing whether good or bad. Being known helps one stay relevant. He was able to give the media a great story. My opponent agrees that Trump has been able to dominate the media. Trump has proven his intelligence, and his ability to con Americans. But, my opponent could ask how this translates to having the qualities of the president. What are the qualities of a president? One would have to judge what previous presidents have done. The qualities I believe would be to: -Further American interests. -Working with the senate. Trump will likely continue where Obama and Bush left off. Trump is an establishment Republican. He likely holds the same views as establishment Republicans. ------------------------------------------------------------ Now, I have a few questions that I would like my opponent to answer. -How many policies that you have listed in your case do you actually think Donald Trump will pass? -Do you believe that Donald Trump has shown his intelligence throughout his life? -Do you believe that Donald Trump is establishment?

trump,"dustryder has beaten me to the punch in the comments. You have agreed completely or partially with all the points you laid out. It may be that your initial definition was a bad one (or a too loosely defined one) but that’s irrelevant. You laid out a series of points that define fascist ideology. Trump fulfills or partially fulfills them all. Therefore Trump must be a fascist to a certain extent. One of the points themselves, Does not a fascist make. Not every nationalist is a fascist and almost everyone is a little nationalist. However when all of the points are true that does point to a certain ideology. It is true that all of these points apply to a lesser extent to almost every politician. That doesn't mean that every politician is a fascist (it might indicate that political power and fascism go hand in hand though). In normal vocabulary fascist is a relative describer. Hitler was a fascist only when contrasted to the west, In Germany many people considered him rational, Etc. . . So when we look to see if Trump's position on all these issues makes him a fascist we have to see if his positions are considered more than ordinary or fringe. It is irrefutable that our political system is more divided than ever, We know that almost all democrats (half of active voters) despise Trump and consider him fringe. We know that a significant portion of Republicans disagree with him but chose him as a lesser of two evils. Meaning that his views directly represent a minority of the population, Making him fringe. As stated before, A fascist would be someone on the relative fringe of a society that fulfills the points you laid out. Trump meets those criteria.

trump,"I happy to accept my opponent Red_Fox's challenge to discuss the important issue of whether or not Donald Trump is a liar and look forward this debate. I plan on responding in two ways: vagueness and the issue of collusion. Point1: Vagueness My opponent formulated the debate thesis in this way: ""President Trump doesn't lie (in all its shades and varieties) in a manner worthy of special tracking. His lack of complete honesty is in line with the mainstream of US politicians and media outlets nowadays. "" There are two glaring issues with the thesis as it stands that makes the burden of demonstrating a lie almost impossible. The first problem occurs with the use of ""special tracking. "" What might constitute ""special tracking? "" Because Red_Fox does not give a criteria for what would distinguish such a lie, Such that it would warrant the description of ""special, "" it is equally possible that Red-Fox's subjective interpretation is the criteria, In which case no one could effectively contradict the thesis, Or all lies are equally ""special, "" which would mean I could affirm the thesis convincingly by stating a single lie from Donald Trump The second vague phrase within the thesis is ""is in line. "" Like before, Red_Fox did not offer any criterion from which to distinguish a base line of dishonesty with a level needed to affirm the thesis. Point 2: Collusion While not the central thesis itself, My opponent used the Washington Post's fact check of Donald Trump's statements on collusion as an example of how the media is dishonest in its reporting; however, There are several problems with this. 2. 1 Donald Trump's statements on collusion are not isolated; rather, They are coupled with other claims (for example, His trashing of the Steele Dossier as fake despite it containing now confirmed details such as Trump-Russia and Trump-China business dealings) such that his entire statement is false 2. 2 Muller's investigation is not solely about collusion anyways so it is irrelevant.",CON,I happy to accept my opponent Red_Fox's challenge to discuss the important issue of whether or not Donald Trump is a liar and look forward this debate.

trump,"1973 Racial Bias Lawsuit Actually, that's only partially true. Donald Trump himself was not sued, Trump Management Inc. was. At that time, as stated by your source, Trump was only an apprentice - his father, Fred Trump, was in charge. This means that any accusations of racism within the company would be attributed to Fred Trump. The title of your source (a liberal-leaning source, however, I'm completely okay with that) is very misleading and even contradicts information that later appears in the title. ""Inside the government""s racial bias case against Donald Trump""s company, and how he fought it"". Well yes, it's Donald Trump's company today, but in 1973 it was owned by Fred Trump; of course Donald will be loyal and defend his father, and of course he will testify in court for him, but to hold Donald Trump entirely accountable is downright false. A better title would be: ""Inside the government's racial bias case against Fred Trump's company, and how Donald Trump defended his father."" On top of that, you didn't provide any evidence that Trump was aware of any racism in his father's company, considering he was just an apprentice at the time. 2. Obama Birth Certificate I'm not so sure about that. Barack Obama was not the only African-American to run for president while Trump was alive. Shirley Chrisholm ran in 1972 - Trump did not ask for a birth certificate. Jesse Jackson ran in 1984 and 1988 - Trump did not ask for a birth certificate. Lenora Fulani ran in 1988 and 1992 - Trump did not ask for a birth certificate. Alan Keyes ran in 1996 and 2000 - Trump did not ask for a birth certificate. Carol Moseley Braun ran in 2004 - Trump did not ask for a birth certificate. Al Sharpton ran in 2004 - Trump did not ask for a birth certificate. Ben Carson ran in 2016, against Donald Trump himself - Trump did not ask for a birth certificate. The reason Trump was suspicious about the birth certificate was because of Obama's ties to Indonesia and Kenya. I think it's a little absurd, but it's not fueled by 'xenophobia' and 'racism'. 3. Presidential Campaign Controversies You claimed that ""Trump's anti-immigration campaign is [racist["". Actually, Donald Trump is pro-immigration and against only illegal immigration. Even though illegal immigration is a minor crime, it is a crime nonetheless - hence the word 'illegal'. We can't turn a blind eye to it, especially when 3 million arrests have been attributed to an undocumented population of only 11 million - and yes, Trump cites this statistic on his website and links to a source. Saying that he is blindly accusing illegal immigrants of crime is false. 4. Gonzalo Curiel Gonzalo Curiel is part of an society called La Raza Lawyers, which ""promotes the interests of Latino communities throughout the state."" The comment Trump made, as he clarified in the interview featured on your source, referred to this rather than referring solely to his Mexican heritage. The idea that someone will be biased against you if they are part of a group that dislikes you is not extreme at all. In my opinion, Trump's comments were fine and not racist. 5. Muslims You're right, Islam is a religion, not a race. That being said, I'll discuss your argument anyway. First of all, he only wants to have a Muslim database for refugees, not Muslim citizens. It says that very clearly in the Politifact source you used. Secondly, he did not suggest that ""Muslims should have to carry around specials IDs"" in your second source, it only says that he did not rule it out at the time, and by the looks of it, he has ruled it out now. Finally, in your third source, he says that perhaps we should start thinking about profiling Muslims, not that he supports it. In fact, he said he is hesitant about profiling in that same source, though he said we should not yet rule it out. He has not gone any further with it, however. 6. KKK Supports Trump They also endorsed Hillary. William Quigg, a grand dragon in California, pledged his allegiance to her and the Klan donated $20,000 to her campaign. Does that mean we can interpret her policies as racist now? Donald Trump is NOT a racist.

trump,"Since you have provided a definition of Fascism for this debate we will work on that definition. You define 4 main qualities that can differentiate a Fascist ideology from a non-fascist one. I will not argue either that Trump fulfills these ideologies completely or that they are the total of his policies. You can have fascist socialists (Nazis), Fascist Communists (Communists), And even fascist-like communal states (cults). Fascism is the name we give to a way of political thinking, Not an ideology in itself. So I move onto the 4 terms you specified: . . . That exalts nation and often race above the individual. . . This is probably the easiest to justify. MAGA is an issue of American pride, Exalting the nation above the individual. Nationalism by itself isn't a bad thing but to a certain degree it's taking away the identity of the individual and putting a social or state identity that people should defend or make ""great"". . . . That stands for a centralized autocratic government headed by a dictatorial leader. . . So here we are talking about degree's. Trump does not have absolute control of America (which would make him a complete dictator), But he is centralizing control of the National government and especcialy to his branch of government. A prime example is the issue of the wall. Where Trump, Unable to pass the plan through congress, Used a power of the executive branch (national emergency) to call for the wall anyway. This has been a consistent theme of his presidency. Him vs. Congress (which his party had control of anyway for the first two years) and him vs. The States (travel ban) . . . Severe economic and social regimentation. . . Again, Degrees. Trump has certainly leaned more towards economic regimentation (trade war with China, Criticism of NAFTA and free trade policies in general) and also social issues (Transgender ban, Appointing anti-pot Attorney General) . . . Forcible suppression of opposition. . . Trump has routinely called the media, His critics, And the actual oppositions the following: Fake news, Enemy of the people, phoney. The list of insults he has actually used is amazing. Although he has only used his power as president to forcibly suppress these voices vary rarely (banning CNN from whitehouse). The main force of trumps power is undoubtedly online and through a mob mentality of calling everything fake news. And even though this is not what we immediately think of as ""forcible"" is is still a type of force and so the statement is true to a certain degree.

trump,"The man leading the current race for the presidency is who? None other than Donald J. Trump. Why is this? Why are people voting for him? I'm both curious and scared. To start this debate, I'll use one of the most obvious points as to why people should not be voting for this man. Racism. In a world that is constantly moving forward, away from a time of racism and prejudice, why is it that there are so many people voting for a man who wishes to bring an end to equality for coloured people? This world is always changing, always evolving, and I had thought that humans, as a species, had moved on from blanket racism. Apparently not, if the majority of Americans are voting for a man who has openly endorsed racist violence. This brings me to another issue on equality. Donald Trump has expressed interest in rescinding marriage equality rights for members of the LGBTQ+ community. He says he is for 'natural marriage'. As I have already said, this world is forever moving onwards. Why take away the rights of a person simply because of their sexual orientation? Why vote for the person that wants to? Trump has also said that he has a big issue with Muslims. This is another example of blanket racism from the man himself. If a minority of Muslims are part of fundamentalist and extremist groups, does that really mean that you should tame away the right to worship from the majority? What Donald Trump, and indeed the people who vote for him for this reason, have failed to realise is that the majority of Muslims are not a part of these groups. He has expressed wishes to close the mosques, but for what reason? Does he really think that will solve his 'problem'? Do you? I have heard that some people vote for Donald Trump because they are tired of listening to politicians. Tired of their empty promises to give this and that, but what makes you think he will be any different? What makes you believe his promises more than anybody else's? What will you do if he gets into the White House, and you find out that he has no intention of fulfilling any promise he's ever made? What makes you think he can do what others cannot?

trump,"I find it a tad bit humerous that my opponent resorts to trolling instead of refutting my arguments. Nevertheless, I shall continue the debate. Economy Donald Trump is going to make America poor again. A group of expert economists did a study on Trump's purposed 35% tarrif on Mexico and 45 tarrifs on China and the results are disasterous. It will cost the Average American $11,500 in increased prices over the next 5 years, and these numbers are expected to continue to climb [1]. It will cost poor Americans 53% of their income and prices will rise 30%. US exports to these nations will decline by 78%! If you want to make America great again, then Trump is not the right answer. Sure Trump may oppose the TPP, but so does Hilary [2]. Trump is simply in love with Hillary and the Democrats, ""I've been around a long time. And it just seems the economy does better under the Democrats than under Republicans. [3]"" Foreign Policy I have previously brought up Hilary's peace deal with Israel and Hamas stoping a war. What has Trump done to even come close to this? Trump actually supported the Iraq War, Trump had stated on the Howard Stern show that he supported the Iraq war when asked. In a seperate interview, he said he'd supported it since the markets would skyrocket [4]. Sounds like strong support to me. As much as Trump likes to bash the Iran deal, we can call this a huge success for Hilary, she created the sanction that finally brougth Iran to it's knees while all the other sanctions just encouraged Iran to continue nuclear developement [5]. Trump stated that he would hammar them with sanctions, but if that was true, Iran would have a nuke under Trump. Speaking of the Iran deal, Trump had originally supported the deal [6]. This is just another foreign policy flip flop by Trump. Bengahzi is a dead issue, Hillary Clinton was interviewed by the Bengahzi investigation pannel headed by Trey Goudy and easily won out.

I'll start by attacking my opponent's constructive. It essentially lists all other major contenders and a short synopsis of why they are unqualified to lead our nation. I'll it down really quickly. Clinton- I agree, Clinton is not the best potential leader of our country (I still find her superior to Trump, but that's irrelevant, as this has evolved into a Trump-Johnson debate) Sanders- Not a communist, seeks a middle ground when it comes to gun legislation. Sanders supports a ban of assault weapons, looks to close the gunshow loophole, and is in favor of instant background checks for mentally ill and felons to keep such individuals from acquiring guns [1] (Trump also supports more background checks [2]). In this case also, I'm not Feelin' the Bern, but would rather have a socialist government under Sanders than an authoritarian one under Trump. Stein- If being a doctor disqualifies her as she is not of the political class, this should disqualify Trump as well. If not believing in the Constitution disqualifies her, it should disqualify Trump as well. Trump has acted or made comments that conflict with the 1st Amendment via free speech, freedom of religion, and freedom of protest ""After a fight erupted between protesters and police last year in Birmingham, Trump said: """"Maybe he should have been roughed up."" Of a protester in Nevada last month, Trump said: ""I""d like to punch him in the face."" In Kentucky, he said: ""Get him out. Try not to hurt him. If you do I""ll defend you in court. "" Are Trump rallies the most fun? We""re having a good time."" [6] [3] [4], 5th Amendment [3], and 14th Amendment [3] [5]. In the Meet the Press interview, it is made painfully obvious that Trump doesn't know the 14th Amendment [7]. Johnson- In the only attack my opponent has made on Johnson so far, he has provided a vague statement with neither evidence nor warrant. Either way, prefer it to Trump's vague anti-China rhetoric (and vague rhetoric on just about everything). Now for general attacks against Trump: 1. Trump vs. Islam Trump not only says that Islam ""hates"" the US [8] but that we should ban all Muslim immigration, as well as banning American citizens who happen to be Muslim from returning here if they have traveled abroad. [9] Not only does this destroy freedom of religion, the ""US vs. Islam"" attitude actually helps ISIS recruiters. ISIS even said in their publications that they benefit from such an attitude. [10] Furthermore, Trump said he would kill the families of ISIS members if he were president [11] because ""They're using them as shields."" Not even because Trump thinks their family members are more prone to radicalization, but because he promotes killing more of the enemy no matter what the civilian casualty rate may be. 2. Trump admires tyrants Donald Trump openly praised Russian president Vladmir Putin [12]. If you don't get why that's not ok... [13][14][15] Trump also kept a book of Hitler quotes on his nightstand when married to now ex-wife Ivana. [16] 3. Trump has literally no foreign policy Trump told reporters he'd like to be ""unpredictable"" when it came to foreign policy. [17] Essentially, he doesn't have one. 4. Trump sucks and everyone knows it His unfavorable rating is around 60%. [18] I'd add more, but I'm tired and feel comfortable with my current position. [1] http://feelthebern.org...

trump,"While I don't agree with everything Donald Trump stands for, I will partially devils advocate for this debate. I think people who know me will be able to tell the difference betwene when I'm serious and when I'm not here. Here we go: OMG Donald Trump is one of the greatest men to ever live! He's a combination of Ross Perot, Napoleon Bonaparte, and Margaret Thatcher and that's saying a lot. It's important to understand that Trump is a very successful businessman who owns a very large corporation. I believe that the government should be run like a business and Trump is just the man. It's also important to remember that Trump has made mistakes and has experienced bankruptcy once. This, however, is a good thing because he now understand how to avoid bankruptcy in the future. I would take Trump, a man who has experienced bankruptcy over Obama, the ""constitutional law professor"" who could not be more hypocritical and has never experienced work in the market before. Trump has worked in the economy, Obama has not. [1] Three things Trump said he would if he were president: 1. Sue OPEC for violating antitrust laws and use America's resources to create jobs. [2] 2. Cut taxes and reduce government spending in order to bring more economic growth. [2] 3. Repeal Obamacare. Who likes that BS anyway? [2] Finally, just because Trump has held no political office does not mean he should not be elected. I anything he's not part of the problem in Washington.

trump,"Donald Trump, the man who has drawn headlines for repeatedly skirting the unspoken rules of decorum during his presidential campaign, has also promised to break several actual United States laws if elected in NovemberR02;""R02;murdering terrorists"" families and torturing suspected criminals among them. These are, of course, likely ""high crimes and misdemeanors,"" and therefore grounds for impeachment under the U.S. Constitution. But even if Trump doesn""t make good on his boasts, has the GOP candidate already laid the groundwork for his Congressionally induced removal from the Oval Office? Don""t be so skeptical: His brief tenure as the face and leader of the for-profit Trump University suggests as much, according to a new working paper from University of Utah law professor Christopher Peterson. In his paper titled ""Trump University and Presidential Impeachment,"" Peterson argues that fraud and racketeering accusations that Trump is currently facing in three ongoing lawsuits regarding his business school may count as high crimes and/or misdemeanors. Peterson, who recently took an academic hiatus to work in enforcement at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, knows what he""s talking about: The professor, who focuses on financial services and consumer protection, spent the past four and a half years determining the validity and reality of""and bringing cases against""banks and other financial providers, payday lenders, mortgage brokers. Or, as he aptly puts it, ""deciding when a case has legs."" There are three ongoing cases against Trump that could head to trial sometime after the November election, which collectively accuse him of fraud, false advertising, and racketeering. In his latest analysis, Peterson argues that, barring settlement, the fraud and racketeering allegations in The People of the State of New York v. The Trump Entrepreneur Initiative LLC; Low v. Trump University, LLC; and Cohen v. Trump University, LLC count as serious and imprisonable crimes in the states in which these cases are being tried, and could also be deemed grounds for impeachment by Congress. (Whether they would decide to act on that reminder is up in the air, however: Under U.S. law, the majority-Republican House of Representatives would have to initiate the motion to impeach Trump, while the Republican-majority Senate would try the impeachment.) If he were impeached, Trump would join Andrew Johnson, impeached and acquitted in 1868, and Bill Clinton, impeached in 1998 and acquitted in 1999, as the third president to face such action in history. As Peterson discussed in a phone call with Pacific Standard, a Trump impeachment would also be highly original: the first to include accusations of racketeering. Peterson talked to us about the strengths, obstacles, and sheer originality of the legal impeachment case against TrumpR02;""R02;and why he thinks Trump may be worried. How did it first dawn on you that these three ongoing Trump University cases might be laying the ground for impeachment if Trump is elected president? I do consumer protection cases for a living, and obviously it isn""t lost on me that Trump is running for president of the U.S., so I took a look at those cases to figure out whether there was something really illegal about what he did there. And as I was reading through the cases, I started to realize how serious the allegations are: The claims that he is currently facing are at the boundary of where a case is no longer really appropriate to be resolved as a civil matter, and needs to be addressed as a crime. Then you think, well, gosh, can we have a president who""s engaged in fraud? That led me to take a look at the impeachment statute and compare that to the alleged inappropriate behavior that presidents have engaged in in the past, and to think about whether this was comparable. What was the strongest legal evidence that you found to support a case for Trump""s impeachment? The most compelling evidence, in my view, are the stories that you hear from consumers themselves. The one that stands out in my mind is from a mom of a kid with Down syndrome. She""s hoping to make a better life for her kid, decides she can""t really afford an expensive Trump Gold Elite mentorship package, but [a Trump University instructor] talks her into buying one anyway, because [the person] convinces her that if she pays $25,000, she""ll make it back in 60 days.

trump,"You agree that there was racial bias in the Trump business. The fact that it was led by Fred Trump at the time doesn’t matter since after the lawsuit Donald could have still admitted there was racial bias and apologized for it. One does not have to defend the racist discriminatory activities of their father (or their employees). Furthermore, Donald became president of his father’s organization in 1974 when the lawsuit was ongoing. He was president years later when the terms of the settlement were violated. Donald, being in a position of power, definitely had responsibility. 2. You agree that Trump’s role in the birther movement was inspired by Obama’s ties to foreign countries. I argued that Obama’s race and relationships with Muslims were also in the mix. Most people understand that none of Obama’s connections invalidate his birth certificate. We could just say that Trump believes in absurd conspiracies for no reason, but usually conspiracy theories pander to underlying biases. The birther movement panders to racist and xenophobic ideas. In regards to your rebuttal about other black candidates, none of them actually won a presidential election (the birther movement reached its peak after Obama was elected) and so they didn’t get the same treatment from Trump. Additionally, as already stated, Obama had other factors that made him the target of xenophobic attacks (I regard xenophobia as essentially a form of racism). 3. As I stated in my original point, Trump does not want more Mexican immigrants, legal or otherwise. If Trump were truly pro-immigration as you argue, he would try to make it easier to migrate to the United States legally. This means reducing the amount of paperwork and easing up on migration restrictions. However, increasing legal immigration was never Trump’s goal, he wants to reduce the total number of Mexicans coming over. The crime statistics you bring up are disputable, but I’m not going to talk about that since it’s not very relevant to this debate (Trump’s original statements were not based on statistics at all, only later did his campaign scour the globe for any information that might bolster Trump’s position). While Trump said that some illegal immigrants are good people, his framing betrays his biases. He described illegal immigrants as a group of criminals with some [he assumes] good people. A person without Trump’s biases would have described them as a group of good people with a sizable number of criminals amongst them. In this instance, Trump was talking strictly about Mexicans, and no listener was left with the impression that Trump would have wanted those same immigrants to be there if only they had the correct paperwork. 4. In the second to last sentence of your rebuttal for part 4 you take for granted that Hispanics dislike Trump. The fact is that not only do Hispanics dislike Trump because of his racism (see above), but Trump realizes this. If the true motivation for Trump’s immigration policies were to reduce crime as you argue in your opening argument, Hispanic Americans should be just as enthusiastic about those policies as anyone else. When Trump sites his own policies as reasons why Hispanics don’t like him, it’s as if he’s saying “of course Hispanics hate me, I’m racist against them”. The incident is significant mostly because it blows away Trump’s cover. Additionally, I maintain that it is racist to say that someone is disqualified because of their race, which is exactly what Trump did to Gonzalo Curiel. 5. Trump clearly supports discrimination against Muslims, most notably by banning their entry into the United States. Your entire rebuttal consists of trying to downplay Trump’s other statements. I’ll be generous and grant you that Trump did not pursue the three proposals besides the Muslim ban. However, at the very least, he gave them serious consideration. Someone who is not bigoted against Muslims wouldn’t take these ideas seriously as they violate fundamental principles. These ideas also wouldn’t work as genuine counter-terrorism strategies since one can lie about their religion. Then again, counter-terrorism is just the cover and not the goal. I will repeat that bigotry against a religious group is still racism, if it weren’t then one could argue that the Holocaust was not racist since it was waged against Jews. 6. Trump’s candidacy led to a wave of enthusiasm amongst racists unseen in any mainstream candidate. Hillary received some support amongst racist Democrats in 2008 when she was running against Obama, but it was not comparable to the support that Trump is getting and it was not because of her ideology. Refer back to Rick Tyler’s “Make America White Again” campaign. He writes on his website: “In our present political season the dominant presence of Donald Trump has served to open us channels of discourse and dialogue that have previously been off limits. His advocacy of a ‘temporary ban’ on Muslim immigration and the construction of a wall on the Southern border have created a climate conducive to conversation relative to the elephant in the living room no one wants to talk about...namely, the urgent and vital subject of race.” (http://webcache.googleusercontent.com...) Again, Trump isn’t responsible for these people, but it’s very revealing that racists see an ally in Trump because of the language he uses and the policies he supports. Also, Trump has done conspicuously little to distance himself from his racist supporters, implying that they probably aren’t misinterpreting his message.",PRO,"As I stated in my original point, Trump does not want more Mexican immigrants, legal or otherwise. ...

trump,"In full, My opinion: Donald Trump is not a racist. Before addressing your points I'd like to ""develop"" an understanding: Where do we draw the line on an accusation and allegation? Especially when labeling one as a racist, A word that carries weight when factually and undeniably proved. Simplified I believe an accusation or allegation needs in my opinion substance, Credibility, And truthful intent. When an accusation or allegation is lacking and/ or is dis-aligned within these things it loses its ability to hold or grasp at a factual status. I would like to hear your opinion on this as it will apply to this debate. 1. This is a line from John R. O'Donnell's book, ""Trumped! "" This is not a direct quote. In fact, All of O'Donnell's book is simply a recollection of what he thinks Trump said. 2. The whole narrative of this quote was to shed light on the atrocities ILLEGAL immigrants have been committing. I'm going to assume for respect's sake that you didn't twist this quote intentionally. In your point you write, ""They're rapists"" when the real quote is, ""Their rapists. "" If he really meant to label all Mexicans then he wouldn't have said, ""and some I assume are good people. "" Which came right after where you left off his quote. 3. The Trump Organization, Fred Trump, And Donald Trump were sued. While reading your points it seems that convenient context is being removed from these situations to paint Donald Trump a racist. I'd like to point out that this case was settled with an agreement to give a group of civil-right's activists priority in housing with Trump Management emphasizing no admission of guilt. I'd also like to point out that all forty-three of the African-Americans accusers of the Trump Organization didn't hold Donald Trump at any fault. Lastly, No evidence was uncovered that Donald Trump created or carried out discriminatory policies. 4. I cannot find anything on the Trump Organization, Fred Trump, Or Donald Trump being sued in 1976 for refusing to rent to people of color. A further explanation of this point would be helpful. 5. I fail to see why this is a point in your argument. Donald Trump spent $85, 000 rolling out an ad campaign calling for the death penalty of these teenagers while firmly believing they were the perpetrators. The police through coercion convinced the teenagers to confess to this crime. Thing is, Unbeknownst to the coercion Donald Trump made this decision; moreover, I personally don't agree with his stance on this issue (even though I can see why he holds this view) but in no way is his view and stance on this issue racist. In no light can one find Donald Trump making this case into anything racial. 6. Absolutely not. Yes, Donald Trump still believes the five are guilty for the rape but he has not in any way shape or form connected race into his stance. Saying he believes they are guilty due to their color is downright outrageous and unfounded. 7. We encounter my issue with accusations and allegations. I find this point lacking substance. Simply put, All the substance of this allegation is a former employee alleging that blacks were ordered off the floor when Trump and Ivana came in. That's it. There is no evidence of this happening nor others speaking out on its behalf that I can find. I couldn't find Trump addressing this allegation anywhere either. 8. Once again cannot find anything on this. Please explain and present detailed evidence of these situations. 9. I'm assuming your point is talking about the CNN State of Union show. Donald Trump after being asked to disavow David Duke responded by saying, ""Well, Just so you understand, I don""t know anything about David Duke, OK? I don""t know anything about what you""re even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists, I know nothing about David Duke. I know nothing about white supremacists. "" He went on to say he needed to do research before he disavows anything or anyone. Thing is, Later during the Republican debates in 2016 Donald Trump DID in fact disavow David Duke and the KKK. 10. Same situation as your first point. If you would like to press these two points more, Then I feel our debate will partly lie in the threshold of authenticity regarding accusations.

trump,"The definitions my opponent uses are vague and unsubstantiated. I propose alternate definitions. Sith Lord: Sith Lord was a title that was conferred on members of various Sith Orders who had both considerable knowledge of and strength in the dark side. (1). With that, it's worth noting that Pro has the Burden of Proof. The one making the positive claim that goes against the status quo (i.e. that Donald Trump is a normal human being) has the burden to substantiate their claims. So before I go through and respond to his individual claims, I'll make a list of the reasons why it's hard to believe that Donald Trump is actually a Sith Lord: 1. Donald Trump has shown no instance, or given any evidence for us to believe, that he can actually use the dark side of the force. As this is a prerequisite to being a Sith, much less a Sith Lord, it's on Pro to give us evidence that he can actually wield the force. 2. There's no evidence to believe that Donald Trump owns a light saber. Possessing a lightsaber is a key attribute of a force-wielder, and it's usually never absent from their person. If he owned one, we would know of it. Therefore, it falls on my opponent to show him possessing and being able to wield a lightsaber. 3. Those seeking to become a Sith Lord, per tradition, had to train and pass the Sith Academy course on Korriban, which consisted of various brutal tests and trials for Sith to overcome.(1) This places a few burdens on my opponent to prove: first, that Korriban exists in the first place, second that Trump has actually visited Korriban to enroll in the Sith Academy, and third that Trump actually successfully completed the Sith Academy and became a Sith Lord. Anything short of this means that Trump cannot be a Sith Lord. With that, let's go to my opponent's claims. ""Donald Trump wishes to achieve great power."" - A few responses to this: 1. So does every other politician. Unless my opponent is claiming that every politician in history was a user of the Dark side of the force, this claim means nothing. 2. This doesn't even mean he's a Sith Lord. By Sith beliefs, this matches literally every single Sith in existence, from the lowely apprentices to the highest ranking Sith Lords and officials. This does nothing to distinguish where in the organization Trump ranks. ""Donald Trump hates Mexicans."" First, reject the assumption that Mexico is the Jedi. Border wars and drug violence seems to indicate that Mexicans are anything BUT peaceful or pacifists. Second, turn this against him as Trump has more dealings with Jedi than he does with Sith. When you hear that the Jedi are peaceful and pacifistic, what country would instantly come to your mind? Mexico, with their drug wars and crime? Or mother-f*cking SWITZERLAND, with absolute neutrality and a hate for conflict and violence? Since Trump for sure has Swiss bank accounts (2), he has more positive interractions with Jedi than my opponent would lead you to believe. This leads us to the conclusion that it's far more feasable for Trump to be a Jedi rather than a Sith. ""Donald Trump wears Sith garments and command a legion of soldiers"" First, that's hardly a legion of soldiers. That's barely more than a platoon. Second, those are hardly Sith garments. That looks like what imabench would wear to a kinky office orgie. As such, there's no reason to believe that Trump is a Sith Lord. Rather the opposite, I'm of the belief that he's a Jedi Knight who deals with peaceful swiss bankers. Sources: [1] - http://starwars.wikia.com...

I can't find anything related as evidence with increase in jobs so I will pass the burden back to you because what I am doing is providing the burden of proof you did not. The GDP is growing at a 3 percent-plus rate. In what way does GDP help to improve the life of Americans? It doesn't and as I have shown with the two below it can't be given as a good reason why Trump is a good president becasue both sources I have stated is that the trend started under Obama and what Trump needed to do is not ruin what Obama did well. The unemployment rate is near a 50-year low. If we look at source 1 it was already on a general trend of decreasing. If Trump really had an impact on unemployment there would be a more drastic decrease when he when into office instead it is a repeat of what happened during Obama's presidency. The decline in unemployment rate started with Obama and continues with Trump. Trump can't take credit for that because the start of the decrease occured during Obama's presidency not when Trump took office. You state 50 year low as if there was some drastic decline under Trump. It wasn't. It was the same gradual decline under Obama and if Trump really did do good for the economy the decline would not be decreasing at the same rate as Obama was in charge. The stock market has jumped 27 percent amid a surge in corporate profits. Source 2 clearly states rich people use the stock market. If this was so good for the majority of Americans it would benefit people would lower incomes but it doesn't. It states from the source only 21% of people earning below $30, 000 a year use the stock market whereas 79% of people use the stock market who earn more than $30, 000 a year. This basically means the stock market is used by the rich to be richer. If your argument was that Trump was helping America with the stock market I will say no he isn't. He is only making the rich richer. Even the stock market itself can be considered a reason why Trump is a good president. This is because the stock market was already on a general trend of increasing. Meaning under Obama it was increase at similar rates so basically all Trump had to do was don't ruin what Obama did and the stock market will be okay. This is from source 3. Another thing I would like to add is that before 2016 the wages were showing a general trend of increasing. Meaning under Obama the wage increasing and it still is under Trump.

trump,"First I want to thank my opponent for challenging me to this debate. I will be going against the argument that Hillary is better than Trump. First off Hillary has done so many things evil in her life that she cannot and, in fact, shouldn't even be allowed to be president. Hillary is worse than Trump for the following reasons: Hillary supports the killing of babies, even after the nine week mark, as well as after birth. She says that babies aren't babies until they leave the hospital. This is outrageous and wrong, and she knows it. She is pro-choice, which is pro-death. Hillary sent private and confidential information by email, and when it was discovered, deleted about 30,000 emails, and lied saying that they were about a yoga program and her daughter's wedding. Really? Like Trump said, that must have been a big wedding. According to nytimes.com (http://www.nytimes.com...) 8 of the emails that were released contained top secret information, 36 contained secret information, 8 contained confidential information, and 2,000 were classified as confidential. These emails show that she can jeopardize America by giving secret information to the wrong people. Hillary should be in jail. In newly leaked videos, the Democratic party were hiring people to incite violence at Trump's rallies, and they were also trying to figure out how to accomplish voting fraud for Hillary. Hillary left a couple people to die. She was heartless. Hillary has done terrible things that people, who have only done one fifth of what she did, have been put in jail for.

trump,"Thanks harrytruman. Quick review of my opponent's R5: 1. Totalitarian Trump I have given numerous examples in my rebuttal of Trump having violated or likely to violate the Constitution, specifically Amendments 1, 5, and 14. ""Trump has acted or made comments that conflict with the 1st Amendment via free speech, freedom of religion, and freedom of protest ""After a fight erupted between protesters and police last year in Birmingham, Trump said: """"Maybe he should have been roughed up."" Of a protester in Nevada last month, Trump said: ""I""d like to punch him in the face."" In Kentucky, he said: ""Get him out. Try not to hurt him. If you do I""ll defend you in court. "" Are Trump rallies the most fun? We""re having a good time."" [6] [3] [4], 5th Amendment [3], and 14th Amendment [3] [5]. In the Meet the Press interview, it is made painfully obvious that Trump doesn't know the 14th Amendment [7]."" -Warren42, rebuttal We'll have to agree to disagree as far as Putin is concerned. I provided sources in my rebuttal proving my position as to why he is not an ideal head of state. harrytruman also put a few words in my mouth in R5. I called Trump authoritarian, not totalitarian. I called Putin an authoritarian and a tyrant, not a dictator. Though these are similar words, they are not the same, and I'd like to make the distinction as this may be an attempt by harrytruman to make a straw man argument against me. 2. Trump vs. Islam I know who the Constitution applies to (though Trump doesn't, see 14th Amendment argument in rebuttal) but the Trump plan also applied to American citizens living overseas. Just because they don't live here doesn't make them non-citizens. Islam is widely recognized as a religion. The argument against it is yours and yours alone, as you have provided no evidence to supplement your claim. The Atlantic, a highly respected publication, was referenced in my R4 arguments to support Islam as a religion. I don't think any further evidence is needed. Islam and Nazism are not comparable. Trump and Hitler are though! Both used bigotry and hatred to rise to power, and Trump admired Hitler according to his ex-wife Ivanka (see rebuttal). Now for my voting issues. I ask the voters to consider these key points when deciding the winner of this debate. 1. Trump is Authoritarian I referenced Trump's ideology conflicting with the First Amendment in three ways- freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of protest. harrytruman argued that Trump's ban of Islam does not violate freedom of religion, yet as I have proved that Islam is a religion and that Trump would also turn back Muslim American citizens living abroad, it does. Note that harrytruman dropped freedom of speech and freedom of protest. Also note that he dropped my 5th and 14th Amendment arguments. As Pro did not address them, Con wins these arguments and in turn, this issue. 2. Trump vs. Islam Again, I proved that Islam is a religion, and that Trump would restrict the rights of Muslim American citizens. This alone should prohibit him from being POTUS. Vote Con. 3. Trump's Foreign Policy It doesn't exist. This was unrefuted by Pro. I prefer a leader with foreign policy. Con wins this issue. 4. Trump vs. Johnson Remember my constructive. Only one person can be elected President. Therefore, if Gary Johnson is better than Trump, Con wins this round. The only criticism of Johnson Pro gave was that free trade with China would ""kill us."" This was without any further explanation or any evidence to support the very vague claim. Extend literally every pro-Johnson argument from my constructive. As Con has won all four of the major points of contention in this round, Con should win this round.

trump,"Trump fans vehemently assert that you cannot call them racist or sexist, simply because they support Trump. I beg to differ. In light of the deplorable things Trump has said about Latinos, Muslims, African Americans, and women, continuing to support him, shows at least tacit approval of racism and sexism. Of course not every trump supporter is a cross burning, p*ssy grabbing maniac. But to support a man who has said the things Trump has, shows open disregard for the well-being, feelings, and economic/social concerns of the groups he demeans. Trump supporters clearly do not think these groups are important enough to be considered or acknowledged, which is a sign that they do not view these groups as equals, who are deserving of dignity and respect. They have dehumanized these people to such an extent, that it is easy for them to ignore the interests of these groups with a disturbingly cavalier attitude.

trump,"There is a long lists of statements and actions made by Trump that reveal his racist attitudes. Trump doesn't come out and make overtly racist comments, but if you read between the lines, pay attention to his tone, and try to understand what he is implying, his racism becomes apparent. Some of his statements can be dismissed individually, but if we examine all of the evidence it shows a clear pattern of racial bias that runs through his campaign and his life. For this debate I define racism as holding negative attitudes or discriminating against people of a particular skin color, ethnic background, or religious identity. Religious identity is the controversial part of this definition and I will return to this when I discuss Trumps attitude towards Muslims. Starting back in 1973, Trump was sued by the Justice Department for alleged discrimination against blacks in his housing complexes (source: https://www.washingtonpost.com...). Two ""testers"", a white woman and a black women who worked for the government, were sent to a Trump apartment complex around the same time to apply for an apartment. While the black woman was told there was no space, the white woman was offered an apartment. During the government investigation, Trump employees told investigators that they placed a ""C"" for ""colored"" on applications filled out by African Americans. Eventually, Trump lost the suit but didn't admit guilt. He argued that he was not discriminating against African Americans, but rather against welfare recipients who couldn't afford to pay. However, the investigation clearly showed this was false. Trump eventually faced a second law suit for not complying with the terms of his first. It's true that Trump never openly discriminated against blacks with something like a ""whites only"" sign, but the evidence for discrimination against blacks is still there. While Trump may be racist, he's also a businessman and he knows that any outwards appearance of racism would hurt his success. Before his presidential campaign, Donald Trump led a campaign to get Obama to release his long-form birth certificate. However, Obama already released his short-form certificate which was all that was expected of any other candidate. This drives the major question, what was the purpose of Trump's birth certificate campaign? The idea that Obama's birth certificate was faked was based on the idea that Obama was not born in America, which I argue is fueled by xenophobia and racism. Obama is different from other candidates in that he's black, has family and friends abroad, and has relationships with Muslims. None of this should bother anyone who isn't xenophobic, but those who are use this to portray Obama as non-American. Trump has both questioned Obama's birthplace, and suggested that he is a secret Muslim. While I can't prove definitively that the birther movement is motivated by racism, I can say racism seems to be the most plausible explanation for its existence. During Trump's presidential campaign, his racial controversies have radiated around two groups, Hispanics and Muslims. Trump made his most controversial comment about Hispanics during the speech that announced his candidacy. It is true that Donald Trump was talking about illegal immigrants from Mexico, and not Mexican immigrants in general. However, I argue that while support for a border wall or deportation is not necessarily racist, Trump's anti-immigration campaign is. To begin with, immigrating illegally is a fairly minor crime; it either means that one crossed an arbitrary line in the sand without the correct paperwork or that one entered legally but overstayed their visa. Immigrating illegally is more comparable to underage drinking or parking in a no parking zone than it is to drug trafficking and rape. Because of this, it raises a red flag when someone is excessively passionate about stopping illegal immigrants. During Trump’s opening speech, he associates illegal immigrants with serious crime without citing statistics. This association would appear to be based entirely off of stereotypes of Mexicans. Trump tried to soften his message by saying that some illegal immigrants (he assumes) are good people, but his emphasis is still clearly on the criminals. At other times, Trump has said that he wants Mexicans to come here, but legally. The problem with this is that the immigration laws we have in place are designed to restrict the number of immigrants who can come here legally. Donald has done nothing to challenge these laws. Trump’s true preference seems to be that these immigrants don’t come at all, legally or illegally. Perhaps the strongest evidence for Trump’s racism against Hispanics was his argument that Judge Gonzalo Curiel was unfit to oversee the Trump University case because of his Hispanic heritage. To say that anyone’s heritage disqualifies them from anything is inherently racist. However, the interesting part about this is that it shows that Trump understands why Hispanics perceive him as racist. In an attempt to defend himself, he argued that his plans to build a wall and to renegotiate trade deals with Mexico have made Hispanics biased against him (http://www.cnn.com... ). If these policies were not motivated by racism then there should be no reason to assume that Hispanics would automatically be against them. It’s therefore very telling that Trump himself believes that these policies cause Hispanics to hate him. Lastly, we get to Muslims. Even though Islam is a religion, not a race, I classify Islamophobia as a form of racism, equivalent to antisemitism. It is acceptable to criticize beliefs or practices associated with a religion, but it is not okay to discriminate against someone simply for the religion they identify with. The majority of Muslims are good everyday people who do not heed the worst parts of their religion. Keep in mind that most Muslims were born into their religion and didn’t subscribe to an ideology. An attack on all Muslims is there for an attack on their identity, not their beliefs. Trump has supported discrimination and profiling of Muslims in several ways: he supported a database of all Muslims (http://www.politifact.com... ), he suggested that Muslims should have to carry around special ID’s (https://www.theguardian.com... ), he advocated strongly for a ban on all Muslims entering the US, and he openly advocated for profiling Muslims (https://www.washingtonpost.com... ). Donald Trump doesn’t talk very much about the effectiveness of these policies as a counter-terrorism strategy; most likely they wouldn’t work since one can simply lie about their religion. Therefore, these policies are probably motivated by racism, not security concerns. Also, while stereotypes can contain shreds of truth, profiling inherently leads to discrimination against innocent people. We’ve learned during the civil rights movement how severely discrimination affects lives. Trump openly supports taking away rights from Muslims, which in my opinion makes him racist. In addition, it’s noteworthy that Muslims are not the only demographic associated with terrorism; Trump could also go after all young males, but he doesn’t. As I have said earlier, many of Trump’s statements and policies are not overtly racist and can be shrugged away. However, it’s not just liberals who interpret him as a racist, it’s also his most extreme supporters. There’s a clear reason why the KKK strongly supports Trump (they interpret his policies as racist, which they believe is a good thing) and Trump has not made a serious effort to distance himself from them. Trump also inspired the overtly racist campaign slogan for Rick Tyler, “Make America White Again” (http://www.nbcnews.com... ). This doesn’t prove that Trump is racist, but it does show that allegations of racism are not simply the result of a liberal smear campaign; Trump’s strongest supporters are interpreting Trump’s message the same way that liberals are. If Donald is being misinterpreted, he’s not doing a good job setting the record straight. Trump has a long pattern of saying and doing racist things. The reason he is not overtly racist is because he doesn’t want to say anything incriminating, as that would hurt both his business and his presidential campaign. That being said, Trump’s biased attitudes towards certain groups are apparent to both his supporters and his opponents.

trump,"""He lied about Hillary being a sad excuse for a candidate."" But, in my opinion, she is!

Trump is not sexist because he doesn't think that women are as skilled as men in the work force. Trump is racist and sexist because he regularly degrades minorities and sexualizes women by saying things like: “Laziness is a trait in the blacks. ... Black guys counting my money! I hate it.” “The only kind of people I want counting my money are little short guys that wear yamakas every day.""

I most certainly don't want to spend 4-8 years of my life listening to those kinds of things while knowing that he represents me as an American Citizen. Trump didn't get out of debt on his own: In 1990, due to excessive leveraging, The Trump Organization revealed that it was $5 billion in debt ($8.8 billion by some estimates), with $1 billion personally guaranteed by Trump himself. The survival of the company was made possible only by a bailout pact agreed upon in August of that same year by some 70 banks, allowing Trump to defer on nearly $1 billion in debt, as well as to take out second and third mortgages on almost all of his properties. If it were not for the collective effort of all banks and parties involved in that 1990 deal, Trump’s business would have gone bankrupt and failed. His failure to acknowledge anyone’s contributions, save his own, in the creation of his success shows where his priorities lay. Trump is a liar: In his book The America We Deserve, Trump explains that, “the greatest threat to the American Dream is the idea that dreamers need close government scrutiny and control. Job one for us is to make sure the public sector does a limited job, and no more.” This quote proves to be particularly ironic when considering Trump’s feelings about eminent domain laws. He was quoted as saying, “I happen to agree with it 100 percent” when speaking of the 2005 Supreme Court decision on Kolo v. New London, which affirmed the government’s ability to transfer land from one private owner to another for the purpose of economic development in the area. In fact, Trump attempted to take advantage of eminent domain laws on multiple occasions, once even demanding that an elderly widow give up her home so that he could build a limousine parking lot. ISIS The idea of a man like Trump ""negotiating"" with ISIS is a frightening one.

trump,"My reasons for asserting that Trump is indeed a racist, as well as the people who support him, are as follows, In 1973 The Justice department sued Trumps Real estate company, alleging that the company quoted different rental rules for African Americans, than it did for whites. Another charge was that his company lied to African Americans by telling them that apartments weren't available, when they truly were. Trump tried to sue the department for 10 million, claiming defamation of character. The company settled out of court, and agreed to give A vacancy list to a certain number of black applicants. However, 3 years later, his organization was sued yet again, for lying to blacks and Puerto Ricans, about the availability of apartments. I believe this fits in with your second definition of racism: A policy, system of government, etc., based upon or fostering the doctrine that one race is superior, and has the right to dominate others; discrimination. Trump also stated that a judge named Gonzalo Curiel, who was presiding over a case against Trumps own university, could not be impartial because he is Mexican. Trumps own words are: ""He""s a Mexican, We""re building a wall between here and Mexico. The answer is, he is giving us very unfair rulings "" rulings that people can""t even believe. Trumps own party was angered by that comment, and attempted to distance themselves from the remark.

Why He’s Voting Trump: Warshauer says he does not believe Trump wants to ban Muslims from entering the country because of a dislike for them, but because he wants to solve terrorism. “”Most are outraged at Trump saying he wants to ban Muslims from entering America, but I support that as a Muslim person, because we have to stop what is happening and work with other Muslim countries to stop terrorism. If you stop Muslims from entering the country, it forces everyone to look at the problem.” Raed Hamdan, 41, Muslim supports Trump. ""Is he reckless with what he says? Yes. Is there a lot of cleaning up to do in the country? Yes. Being a billionaire, I can’t see anyone buying him—paying him off to push him in one direction or another.

trump,"Donald Trump is far from perfect. He is far from it, Not only failing at several things as president but also as a businessman. As president, Trump's biggest failure is the coronavirus and the slow reaction of his White House. Despite being warned several times, President Trump refused to accept the reality of the coronavirus, Assuring the country that it was ""under control"". However, It became very obvious that the country was not safe, And by the time Trump finally took proper action, The US was the new hotspot of the virus. Even now, As we accept our new reality, Trump ignores the virus, Pushing for reopening with disregard to coronavirus guidelines and the safety of our citizens. As a businessman, Trump has also had his failures. One of his many failures is his involvement in casinos. Trump's Taj Mahal was the most expensive project he had ever participated in when it first opened, Costing a whopping $1 billion dollars to build. It was located in Atlantic City, And attracted thousands of visitors each day it was open. However, A year later, The casino had failed to make enough profit to cover its cost, Going into Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Trump, Who could not afford to pay $1 billion dollars back to the banks that he had lended from, Was forced to sell his yacht and airline, Both a huge part of his figure and pride back then. As you can tell, Trump is far from perfect. He has made many mistakes in his life and will most likely continue to do so up until his death.

This election is different because we are faced with an outsider as the Republican candidate on the ticket this year. That""s without getting into an argument about the Democratic selection, but it must be mentioned because she adds to the interest in this case. However, Donald Trump being an outsider is a good thing. His ideas are not radical; they just go against the way things have been done. Its time to take a turn off the same road we""ve been driving on for years and see where that takes us. Donald Trump owes no one for the position he is in.

A man who isn""t afraid of his own ideas, a man who says what he thinks. Not a man who has filtered his ideas through rooms full of people who have polled every sentence that will be said to know how it will play on the American people. Donald Trump has ideas as I will continue to explain. He wants to bring jobs back to the American worker. He wants to stop outsourcing jobs to China and other places where the work can be done cheaper. With souring unemployment, why wouldn""t we want this. Unemployment effects everyone in almost every aspect of their life. Taxes go up, crime rates go up, and the list goes on. Bringing Jobs back to America is a great thing. Now down to the nitty gritty of things. His proposed policies. This is why I support Donald Trump for the Republican nomination for President of the United States. One of the areas that seems to get hit hardest is his immigration policy. Building of the wall. Mexico who had a problem with immigration and drug trade from their southern border did the same thing. They built a wall. Why shouldn""t we. It is not racist, hurtful, or hateful. I am expected to obey the laws of the land, so should every person in this country.

trump,"Rebuttal: Donald Trump is without a doubt a successful businessman, and is very knowledgeable about the economy. However, Donald Trump is not a politician. He may have what it takes to employ the people of his businesses, but that does not mean he will be able to find a way to employ the millions of Americans without a job(from a political standpoint). Trump has been proved to fail in many business situations as well; he is not all just success. Take a look at the scandal involving Trump University. At the start, Trump University violated the law of operating without proper license, according to the NYSED license code of conduct.[1] Given the fact that Trump had violated laws in order to make money suggests how Trump may not even be that great of a businessman in the end, considering that he has to break laws in order to make his fortune. (Not to mention, the numerous lawsuits upon Trump following the scandal). Due to these reasons, the argument that Trump would make a good president because of the fact that according to Pro, he is a ""good businessman"" is faulty. (Not to mention the fact that your contention is extremely superficial) Contention 2: Trump would not make a good president because he does not practice as he preaches. Trump says that as president, he will look to employ American workers, and find Americans specifically, jobs. This is a faulty Trump statement as he has even openly admitted that in his companies, he does not employ as many American workers as he should. Trump turned down 94 percent of job applicants from American workers.[1] Trump promises to get more Americans employed, but is that what truly wants? If that were truly what Trump wanted, he would not have declined 94 percent of American applicants for his companies. Trump would make a poor president because he does not practice what he says his ideology is. Thanks for the great debate! You had strong arguments!

brexit,"Hello! I have a number of arguments that will be elaborated upon in further posts. For now, here they are: 1. Global Economic Impact As we have already seen, the Brexit has already led to severe economic implications in markets worldwide. Over $2 trillion have already been lost just in one day (June 24).This has resulted in worldwide stock markets plunging in value. Spain's IBEX 35 fell 12.5%, NASDAQ fell 3.6%, Europe's Euro Stoxx 50 tumbled 9.1%, and Japan's NIKKEI 225 fell 7.9%. The British pound has plummeted to its lowest level in thirty years in just one day! British trade will be hindered by not being able to easily trade with the continent. This will inevitably result in further economic trouble in Britain even after this initial damage outlined above. As for Europe: the EU just lost its biggest economy. This will mean that the whole of Europe just got a whole lot poorer, because Britain no longer has easy access to trade. What will this mean for countries like Greece? What will happen to the European continent if there's an economic downturn? The financial security of Europe and all of its trading partners will be made much weaker because of Brexit. 2. Impact on Britain As we both know, there was a referendum in Scotland in September of 2014 to secede from the UK. It failed and the UK is still whole. In the Brexit vote, Scotland voted overwhelmingly to stay in the EU. Already there is talk in Scotland of seceding and rejoining the European Union. There is also a movement starting for the reunification of Ireland (meaning the UK would also lose Northern Ireland). If these happen and the UK is split into three pieces, the consequences will be both profound and irreparable. The UK is our strongest ally overseas. If it splits, NATO, the UK, and the US will be much less powerful, both militarily and economically. Brexit has already set this in motion. Would you (or anybody) knowingly and willingly support the weakening of our country? 3. Peace in Europe The organizations that led to the EU were founded in 1945, just after World War II. The idea was to create a union of countries that would be so closely intertwined that war between them would be unthinkable. After Brexit, other countries are already clamoring to leave the EU as well. This Brexit has started a long domino chain that will eventually result in the collapse of the EU. At some point, there will be war in Europe because of this collapse. Now that countries are abandoning the network that has held relative peace in a whole continent, who knows what the disastrous consequenses will be?",CON,"This will mean that the whole of Europe just got a whole lot poorer, because Britain no longer has easy access to trade. ...

Just as a note--since the British people have now voted to leave the EU, I hope that it happens and that Britain does succeed in invoking Article 50.

brexit,"Britain's latest campaign to leave the EU is the biggest yet and it has garnered enough momentum to have a referendum. The Leave Campaign argues that Britain is losing out a big deal by staying in the EU: it has to pay millions of pounds each week as a contribution to the European budget; the extremely bureaucratic nature of the European parliament is hurting British exporters; and finally, that unmitigated migration from the European Union into Britain is creating an imbalance in the welfare schemes of the UK government. However, as numerous experts have pointed out, none of this truly holds water. Britain gains much more from the EU than it pays as contributions; despite the bureaucratic hurdles, British companies have unfettered access to the entire European Union; and finally, Britain would not be able to shut its doors to immigrants even if it exits the EU because to trade with the bloc, it would need to accept some share of outsiders within its borders. Despite being a ludicrous proposition, countries across the world must address the contingency of a Brexit. If it does happen, it will have wide-ranging repercussions on every country that is remotely connected with the global financial market. Here are five ways in which India will be affected: 1. The uncertainty following Brexit: The biggest drawback of the Leave Campaign is that they have not mapped out the future course of action if Brexit indeed happens. There is no sound plan regarding Britain's future relationship with the EU or any other specific country within the EU. Will they continue to have access to the European markets? Will trade barriers increase if they leave? Are there any agreements with the Union regarding the movement of goods, capital and labour? These are the important questions that are left unanswered by those advocating for Britain to leave the EU. And it is precisely the uncertainty over these questions that are spooking financial markets across the world. If Brexit does happen, global financial market volatility can be readily expected. Markets across the world will tank. The pound will depreciate against most major economies. India cannot remain immune to this. Sensex and Nifty will tumble in the short-run. 2. Investment: India is presently the second biggest source of FDI (Foreign Direct Investment) for Great Britain. One of the main reasons for this is the historic and cultural ties with the UK that India shares along with the fact that the UK proved to be a gateway into the rest of Europe. Indian companies that would set up their factories in the UK could sell their products to the rest of Europe under the European free market system. However, if Britain exits the EU, it will not be as attractive a destination for Indian FDI as before. Having said that, Britain would not want to lose out on capital coming in from India. Thus, one can expect Britain to try extra hard to woo Indian companies to invest there by providing much bigger incentives in terms of tax breaks, lesser regulation and other financial incentives. Further, if Britain is leaving the EU due to the latter's complex bureaucratic regulatory structure, Indian companies can expect a deregulated and freer market in Britain. 3. Another EU partner: As aforementioned, if Britain exits the EU, India will lose its gateway to Europe. This might force India to forge ties with another country within the EU, which would be a good result in the long run. India is already trying to build trade negotiations with Netherlands, France, Germany, and others, albeit in a small way. Netherlands is India's top FDI destination as of now. A Brexit could force India to build trading partnership with other EU nations in order to access the large EU market. 4. The Commonwealth: With Britain cutting off ties with the EU, it will be desperate to find new trading partners and a source of capital and labour. There have already been many proponents of the Leave Campaign that suggest that the UK should look towards the Commonwealth to forge new alliances. Britain will still need a steady inflow of talented labour, and India fits the bill perfectly due to its English-speaking population. With migration from mainland Europe drying up, Britain would be able to accommodate migration from other countries, which will suit India's interests. Further, Britain is one of the most important destinations for Indians who want to study abroad. Presently, British universities are forced to offer subsidized rates for citizens of the UK and EU. With Brexit, however, the universities will no longer be obliged to provide scholarships to EU citizens, which will free up funds for students from other countries. Many more Indian students may be able to get scholarships for studying in the UK. 5. Ties with European Union: With or without a Brexit, it would be in Europe's interest to develop India as a strong trade and strategic partner. Brexit would surely accelerate this process. Europe needs to counterbalance United States and China geopolitically and would also need to hedge against a slowing China for its economic interests. For this, Europe would be looking at the fastest-growing major economy in the world and would need to quickly resolve the pending trade issues with India in order to develop a lasting relationship. Thus, even though Britain stands to suffer from leaving the European Union in terms of reduced trade and a sustained drop in its GDP, the net effect can turn out to be positive for India.",PRO,"However, as numerous experts have pointed out, none of this truly holds water. ...

brexit,"Anti-Brexit had the facts, Brexit had the rhetoric. Irrational fear of immigration and losing autonomy. Britain clearly needs migrants considering it's own workers don't want to work the dirty jobs such as farming so migrants need to do it for them. [1] Let's Look at the facts. Britain's Membership in the EU costs around 6.3 Billion pounds or 0.3% of britains GDP. So for the leave side to be economically superior leaving would not be able to affect the UK by more than 0.3%. But considering the UK makes 13% of it's GDP from selling commodties to the EU this seems unlikely. [2] The problem with this is that economists predict that the UK could lose up to 6% of It's GDP from leaving the EU which is much greatet than 0.3% [3] This isn't even including additional costs for tarrifs that would amount to close of the cost for eu membership after free trade deals are abolished along with eu membership.

brexit,"While there may be a few advantages to the Brexit, I find it very unnecessary.

brexit,"It's an honour, Envisage. Yes, this debate format is nice, but a little bit tight, if you know what I mean? Brexit's Disadvantages: Most Foreign Direct Investment comes from the EU. UK's FDI is worth 1 trillion [1]. Foreign investors like investing in the UK because it gives them easy access to the EU's single market (which means less borders in moving goods, less tarriffs, and more profit). Brexit makes it harder for UK to trade with EU. Deals can be made but will probably not be as good as it was before Brexit. Thus, investors look elsewhere than UK. UK loses a varied amount of FDI. Graph: http://tinyurl.com... Any deals made, is likely to be complicated. The leaders of the EU have already said that in order for UK to access the single market, it must allow free movement of EU workers (for them to easily immigrate to the UK).

About 3/4 of EU workers would fail this test, those in the primary and secondary sector (farming, hotel staff etc.). [3] It's not just a problem of foreign workers.

And it is precisely the uncertainty over these questions that are spooking financial markets across the world. If Brexit does happen, global financial market volatility can be readily expected. Markets across the world will tank. The pound will depreciate against most major economies. India cannot remain immune to this. Sensex and Nifty will tumble in the short-run. 2. Investment: India is presently the second biggest source of FDI (Foreign Direct Investment) for Great Britain. One of the main reasons for this is the historic and cultural ties with the UK that India shares along with the fact that the UK proved to be a gateway into the rest of Europe. Indian companies that would set up their factories in the UK could sell their products to the rest of Europe under the European free market system. However, if Britain exits the EU, it will not be as attractive a destination for Indian FDI as before. Having said that, Britain would not want to lose out on capital coming in from India. Thus, one can expect Britain to try extra hard to woo Indian companies to invest there by providing much bigger incentives in terms of tax breaks, lesser regulation and other financial incentives. Further, if Britain is leaving the EU due to the latter's complex bureaucratic regulatory structure, Indian companies can expect a deregulated and freer market in Britain. 3. Another EU partner: As aforementioned, if Britain exits the EU, India will lose its gateway to Europe. This might force India to forge ties with another country within the EU, which would be a good result in the long run. India is already trying to build trade negotiations with Netherlands, France, Germany, and others, albeit in a small way. Netherlands is India's top FDI destination as of now. A Brexit could force India to build trading partnership with other EU nations in order to access the large EU market. 4. The Commonwealth: With Britain cutting off ties with the EU, it will be desperate to find new trading partners and a source of capital and labour. There have already been many proponents of the Leave Campaign that suggest that the UK should look towards the Commonwealth to forge new alliances. Britain will still need a steady inflow of talented labour, and India fits the bill perfectly due to its English-speaking population. With migration from mainland Europe drying up, Britain would be able to accommodate migration from other countries, which will suit India's interests. Further, Britain is one of the most important destinations for Indians who want to study abroad. Presently, British universities are forced to offer subsidized rates for citizens of the UK and EU. With Brexit, however, the universities will no longer be obliged to provide scholarships to EU citizens, which will free up funds for students from other countries. Many more Indian students may be able to get scholarships for studying in the UK. 5. Ties with European Union: With or without a Brexit, it would be in Europe's interest to develop India as a strong trade and strategic partner. Brexit would surely accelerate this process. Europe needs to counterbalance United States and China geopolitically and would also need to hedge against a slowing China for its economic interests. For this, Europe would be looking at the fastest-growing major economy in the world and would need to quickly resolve the pending trade issues with India in order to develop a lasting relationship. Thus, even though Britain stands to suffer from leaving the European Union in terms of reduced trade and a sustained drop in its GDP, the net effect can turn out to be positive for India.",CON,"However, as numerous experts have pointed out, none of this truly holds water. ... Britain gains much more from the EU than it pays as contributions; despite the bureaucratic hurdles, British companies have unfettered access to",282
brexit,"First I’d like to thank my opponent for accepting this debate. And before I start my argument I’m going to begin with quickly refuting a couple of the arguments are too often brought up in defence of us remaining within the European Union in the hope that my opponent won't attempt to use them. Stock Market: The main British stock market the FTSE 100 is currently at a high for this year in the wake of the EU referendum [1]. The FTSE 250, a more expanded version, has lost value however it has already made up over half of its losses [2]. This will mean that the Brexit crash will have no more long term stock market impact than the February [3] which at this point no one remembers. Long Term Economic Impact: The least optimistic forecast for the economic impact of Brexit is that by 2030 our economy will be 3.2% lower than it would otherwise have been [4]. By the year 2030 based on current projections our economy would have been at 4,169,828,700,000 USD [5] (PPPGDP) or 58730 USD per capita (taking into account population projections [6] ) without brexit and with brexit based in worst case scenario our economy will be 4,078,092,468,600 USD (PPPGDP) or 57438 USD per capita giving us growth of 148% during that time period rather than 151% during the same time period. This is an incredibly minor impact on growth and not the catastrophic economic crash reminiscent of the 2008 crash that was predicted by some of the remain camp. Scotland: It is feared the Scotland could have another independence referendum due to the Brexit vote. However in reality the conservative party in the UK which will remain in power for the foreseeable future has said that this issue is “settled for a generation” [7] meaning that it is very unlikely to have a referendum for Scottish independence after the Brexit. Furthermore there has been no pledge for an independence referendum from the main opposition Labour party. The combination of these factors means in all likelihood there will be no independent Scotland. Main Argument: Long term goals of the EU: The EU is designed to create an “ever closer union” between EU member states [8]. Britain is unique among EU member states in having an opt out to this [9] following our last series of negotiations with the EU. While on the surface this is good it means that the there are fundamental differences between the future goals of the UK and the EU which if we had stayed in the EU would have ultimately lead to a widening gap between the EU and the UK. Sovereignty and Democracy: The EU does not operate democratically, while it is true that the European parliament is elected (which has some of its own problems which we will come to) it is not the European parliament that forms the laws [10] instead it is the European commission [11] which is made up of 28 unelected members who wield the majority of the power within the EU. Another problem with the EU in this regard is that it has no developed demos, that is a people who feel a connection together and some connection to the state overall. Instead what the EU has is 28 (soon 27) different demoses all of which act in their own interests and lead to a union which is fundamentally irreconcilable with a functioning democracy. This is why the elected body of the EU is made up of so many disparate parties representing so many disparate national interests and the ruling side is made up of coalitions of coalitions rather than in other nations where there are one or two ruling parties [10]. Furthermore in order to be a member of the European Union states must hand over many of the necessary trappings of statehood to the EU, this includes large sections of the immigration policy of member states [12], large parts of the financial policy through a partial fiscal union [13]. Furthermore the European Union has the ability to regulate extensively in many fields [14] and these regulations make up anywhere from 10 to 50 percent of UK law [15] and considering that one law decided through an undemocratic process and imposed on the people of Britain would be unacceptable even the minimum figure is by itself justification to leave. Democracy and sovereignty are not abstract concepts with no real meaning or application, they are fundamental for a free and prosperous nation [16]. [1]http://www.londonstockexchange.com...

brexit,"Your main argument seems to be that (security > all other concerns). ""Security of the country is more important than trade"" This is where I simply cannot agree with you. The long-term damage to the economy, And the resulting affect that will have on the peoples lives, Far outweighs short-term damage caused by immigration. ""A border crossing with northern and southern Ireland is also critical in keeping the IRA at bay and controlling movement of people"" Both sides of this issue have agreed that they don't want a border between the Irelands.

You need to account for the massive loss to trade, The affect of delayed transit and delayed travel times, The rights of ex-pats living outside the UK, The damage to small businesses caused by tariffs, The list goes on. I argue that your position is over-simplified. Brexit has massive, Dangerous implications to all of the above.

brexit,"Outline: When considering whether a policy is a “mistake,” everything should be accounted for and if a policy will bring more bad than good, it should be considered a mistake. In other words, neither Con nor I need to show that Brexit is completely good or bad either way for Britain. Merely, we need to show that, all things considered, Brexit is a net positive or negative for the UK. Argument 1-Economic Effects: Con has conceded this whole argument; therefore, we both agree that Britain will face an economic downturn as a result of leaving the EU. This means that Con accepts that Britain will suffer economically from the loss of free trade deals and lack of immigration to stimulate the economy. Argument 2-Scotland: Con failed to respond to or even reference this argument. Therefore, due to a lack of rebuttal, the point stands that Brexit will most likely lead to Scottish independence. Con’s Case: Con’s case can be broken up into three arguments: disadvantages of open borders (his third paragraph), the burden of the EU’s complex constitution (his fourth paragraph), and the benefits of being an independent a nation (his fifth paragraph). I will address each of these separately. Rebuttal 1-Open Borders: Con’s argument for open borders is riddled with bare assertions and absent of any evidence. Con’s argument can essentially be boiled down to the idea that the EU does a “lousy job of isolating terrorism,” yet an independent UK would be much more efficient at spotting out terror threats. However, neither of these ideas is presented with any evidence. Thus, there is no reason to accept Con’s argument that Britain would deal with terrorism better without the EU. Rebuttal 2-Complex Constitution: Once again, Con provides no evidence for his argument. He argues that, because the EU has a relatively complex constitution, it leads to corruption because it’s confusing. However, that argument is ultimately unconvincing because no evidence is provided. He mentions how the American constitution works better because its simplicity allows Americans to fight for their rights more. However, there is no evidence for this, nor is there evidence that the EU is corrupt and trampling on the people’s rights. Once again, this leaves Con’s argument empty. Rebuttal 3-Benefits of Independent: Con continues to argue with bare assertions, absent of any evidence. This argument can essentially be boiled down to the fact that being an independent nation is better and that Britain will bounce back, better than ever. It’s a really idealistic argument, but lacks any substance. For instance, there is no reason to accept the premise that being an independent nation is better. He simply states it, along with brief mentions of freedom of speech, national border protection, and national pride. Border protection has already been discussed, but he doesn’t show how the EU suppresses Britain’s freedom of speech or national pride; Con also fails to demonstrate why either of those helps the UK. Con also fails to provide a reason to believe Britain’s economy will bounce back, beyond bare assertions. No statistics to demonstrate this and he had already conceded to my arguments that would suggest otherwise. Therefore, there is no reason to accept any of Con’s statements in this argument. Conclusion: To conclude, due to a lack of any evidence, Con has failed to provide any convincing reasons why passing Brexit was a good decision. Also, due to Con having no rebuttal to my points that passing Brexit was a bad decision, it stands that passing Brexit was mistake for the UK.",PRO,"Rebuttal 1-Open Borders: Con’s argument for open borders is riddled with bare assertions and absent of any evidence. ...

brexit,"I am sorry for my lack of evidence. That was my mistake. Perhaps I thought that there would be a general knowledge to be able to look up the United States Constitution as well as the EU's constitution as they are well known documents. As for you saying I have conceded to this argument, I beg to differ, there is no evidence suggesting this, and is merely an assumption by my opponent. Argument 1: Economic Effects: You are right, there will be an economic downturn. That unfortunately for you was not what this debate was about, the subject of this debate is ""Passing Brexit was a mistake for the United Kingdom"", and not ""There will be an economic downturn due to the passing of Brexit"". So I believe I am in the clear to agree with you on the economics of the situation. This does not mean I agree with you that Brexit was a mistake. I clearly stated that anytime a country desires to gain freedom there will be a storm before the clear. I believe the economy will become bad before it becomes good again, the difference is that the UK will be independent once it climbs atop the economic hill and ends up on the other side, thus making it a prospective decision. According to the World Trade Organization (of which the UK is a part of), over half of the UK's trade is with other countries and not with the EU, so that is over half of their trade that will go unaltered. As for trade with the EU, the UK is a number one trade market for many countries under the EU, and for that chain to break would be devastating to both countries, so I don't really believe it will happen. For instance, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity at MIT, the UK is the 9th largest export economy in the world and is the most profitable export market for countries that are in fact in the EU. For ex: Germany. The UK alone accounts for 34% of the German surplus with the EU making the UK by far Germany's most profitable export market. That is just one example of how the EU will probably without a doubt continue on with the UK in trade markets. Argument 2: Scotland You said that ""It is reasonable to conclude that the passing of Brexit will likely lead to a literal dividing of the UK, which would undoubtedly be a mistake for the UK"". You did not back up your argument. I'd like to know why the division would be a mistake for the UK, which you did not expound on. I would like to suggest that a division of the UK could in fact be a very good thing. For one, Scotland might become independent again (like they were before the year 1707) under the European Referendum. The First Minister of Scotland Alex Salmond stated ""an independent Scotland, aided by its oil wealth, would be one of the world's richest countries"". Scotland actually would be in a good position for wealth if they became independent of the UK, and not only that, Scotland would have all the things I mentioned in my first argument that comes with independence: more freedoms, national pride, leeway for better prospects, etc. Now, Scotland also wants to rejoin the EU if they become independent (You don't need evidence for this, just look at the news right now), which wouldn't be the worst thing to happen for them. As for what happens to the UK if Scotland leaves, it will not be the end of the UK. For one thing, (and this is my opinion, nobody elses) if Scotland leaves the UK, that if anything, will give the North East a great advantage in trade--having a land border with an EU country will be excellent for trade and relations. And once again, I will state: An independent country is better than a dependent country. Conclusion: Once again, I will say that I agree with you, the UK will have the disadvantage due to Brexit....At the beginning. (I'm not saying you win this argument, don't misinterpret that, I am merely agreeing a point with you). But if you could see the benefits of becoming an independent country, then for all that is holy, why not take a chance? People are so scared of change and the implications of change, that they cower. I truly believe that the UK voters voted on Brexit because they had faith that they would come through on the otherside unscathed and rewarded. I do not believe that all UK people didn't understand what Brexit was when they voted. In fact, only millions were googling Brexit after the vote out of 64 million people.( The news likes to exaggerate things). The UK will be fine as long as they do everything correctly. Trade will come back, independence will become a flying beacon of freedom, and the UK will find its place in this world with bigger and better prospects that were never thought possible before.

brexit,"Outline: When considering the resolution, it is important to remember that both sides have to prove what is better for the United Kingdom, the nation, as a whole. Argument 1-Economic Effects: When considering policy it is of utmost importance to always consider the economic effect. Nations typically thrive when their economies do. However, Brexit will almost certainly hurt the British economy. The British economy is heavily dependent on trade with the EU. Trade with the EU accounts for half of Britain's exports and imports; moreover, Britain's exports to the EU account for 15% of its GDP. (1) The main reason for this was due to the limited, if any, trade barriers the British experienced while in the EU. So, it can be observed that being in the EU gave markets for the UK to export its goods and also allowed it to import goods for cheaper. This is obviously good for Britain as a whole, as it creates demand for their products overseas (creating more jobs in areas where British products and services would be in high demand) and also allows the people to purchase goods for cheaper (due to avoiding tariffs, border control, etc.) The London School of Economics’ Centre for Economic Performance, created a model showing two possible outcomes for Britain. One scenario is if the UK makes its own free trade agreements with the EU (like Switzerland and Norway) and the other is if the UK is unable to make such agreements, and thus faces much higher trading costs and barriers. Both result in British national income dropping. If Britain is able to negotiate such deals the expected decline was calculated to be 1.1% of GDP, but if they are not, the expected decline was calculated to be 3.1% of GDP. (1) The study also accounts for the common counter-argument that the UK will save money that currently goes to the EU, which will stimulate the economy. However, not only is this a very miniscule amount, 0.53% of the national income, the study also showed how Switzerland and Norway pay on a per capita basis 41% and 83%, respectively, what the British currently pay to the EU, just to have such trade deals. (1) One may argue that the British will simply be able to negotiate new trade deals with other nations. However, this argument is weak seeing as there is currently nothing stopping the British from currently doing so. In fact, it may be more difficult now that the UK has left the EU. The EU is currently negotiating two major trade deals with the US and Japan (the world’s largest and third largest economy, respectively). The study calculated that these trade deals likely would have saved British households a total of £6.3B. (1) Finally, another benefit Britain gains from being an EU member nation is it is highly integrated with other European economies. One of the benefits of this is that Britain receives a lot of direct foreign investment. Currently, Britain is beat only by the US in the amount of direct foreign investment. This is because, in the EU, the UK is well integrated with European markets and can act as “export platform” to the rest of Europe. (1, 2) However, many international banks are considering moving some of their business from London to Frankfurt in response to Brexit, as Germany is another major economic power in the EU. (2) This could become a trend, especially if the British are unable to negotiate new trading deals with the EU, as the UK will become much more economically isolated than its continental counterparts. Not only that, but Britain will also not be integrated with EU policy, that could affect their business in other ways. Jacob Funk Kirkegaard lays out this argument as such: “If you are Nissan or some other car producer with major production in the UK, today, the same safety standards and environmental standards allow you to sell everywhere in the European market,,,[but if the UK leaves] you would no longer be able to sell into other European markets, not because you face a small tariff but because you'd have to go through another set of safety certifications. This kind of thing would be repeated in every industry you can think of.” (3) The argument here clearly displays how Britain’s reduced integration would make it harder for companies to sell to Britain and EU nations, simultaneously. When one considers that the EU is a much bigger market than the UK, it is reasonable to conclude that companies would rather adjust to EU standards over British standards. Thus, the UK will also suffer from its reduced integration with the rest of Europe. Overall, it is clear that Britain greatly benefited from its trade deals and integration with the rest of Europe as an EU nation, thus leaving will hurt their economy. Another common argument for Brexit is that the EU forces Britain to take in migrants who leach welfare and hurt the economy. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the British will now implement a more restrictive immigration process. However, this will also hurt the British economy in the long run. The main thing to consider is that the reputation of the lazy migrant is unfounded. For instance, over a ten year span, migrants contributed a net £20B to British public finances. (4) Also, immigrants were also found to be 43% less likely than natives to receive state benefits or tax credits. (4) Not only that, but one only needs to consider that the UK is facing an aging crisis. Due to relatively low fertility rates and increased lifespans, Britain will be facing an increased strain on its pension services and healthcare, while also seeing a decline in productivity (less people of working age). (5) For this reason, it is important to consider how the British economy will look in the following decades, because without increased immigration/migration, the British will undeniably see its workforce shrink and public spending increase. To conclude, from an economic perspective, Britain is in desperate need of immigrants. Overall, it is abundantly clear that Brexit will be a negative force on the British economy. Britain will lose several benefits it gained from being an EU nation, as well as likely facing restrictive immigration laws which will only hurt the country in the long run. Argument 2-Scotland: It doesn’t take much convincing to realize that a country is better off unified than divided. However, the passing of Brexit threatens to literally break up the country. A little less than two years ago Scotland voted to stay in the UK. One may assume then that, that would be the end of the issue; Scotland will remain part of Britain. However, during the Brexit vote Scotland voted heavily, 62% to 38%, in favour of staying in the EU. (6) Also, in response to the Brexit vote, polls are now showing support for Scottish independence to be at 59%. (7) In fact, following Brexit, Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said that it is “highly likely” that Scotland will have another vote to leave the UK. (8) Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the passing of Brexit will likely lead to a literal dividing of the UK, which would undoubtedly be a mistake for the UK. Conclusion: To conclude, one only needs to look at the stats to realize that Brexit will hurt the British economy and could likely lead to the nation breaking up. These two points are more than enough proof that passing Brexit was a mistake for the UK, as it will undeniably hurt the nation more than help it.

brexit,"I appreciate your response, So here is my final debate round Security of the country is more important than trade. Just look at what is happening in the rest of Europe. The migrant crisis is reaching epic proportions all the way to France because the borders were open and the migrants came cross all borders unobstructed. From Italy and Turkey through the rest of open Europe through the poorer nations all heading for England the most prosperous country in the EU. A border crossing with northern and southern Ireland is also critical in keeping the IRA at bay and controlling movement of people. Open borders are a disaster for security reasons. It might be easier to cross borders for regular travelers but lets look at the Sicilian mafia, They are now free to roam all over Europe, The Russian mafia has open borders to travel to England right now and poison people with polonium. The Gypsies can roam all around Europe without obstruction. And finally the migrants from the middle east including ISIS can freely cross from Turkey to anywhere in Europe. Everybody is complaining about Brexit until the bombs go off in France and England or a 1000 women are raped in Germany over the holidays because there is no control at the border. Switzerland and Norway are not in the EU and they are doing excellent. Not everyone needs to be in a big EU boys club. Countries all separated a long time ago because people couldn't get along. Yugoslavia split into 6 countries because they couldn't get along, Who says we need to make one big Europe country? Have we not learned from the Roman empire, From the Ottoman empire. Countries are created every decade in Africa, In the past in South America. Panama did not want to be part of Columbia so they created their own country with a border. Not having borders or having open borders is a bad idea. That's like not having a fence with your neighbor. And besides why should England pay 13 billion euros to the EU, How much is Romania and Bulgaria paying? Nothing. England is a rich prosperous country, They don't need to be part of the EU clan that is suffering from migrant invasions and terrorism. Besides other countries are pulling out too, Poland and Sweden mentioned they might pull out next. You can have your own country so why would you want to be under the thumb of the Hague and the big brother EU.

brexit,"I will first begin my addressing the rebuttals made by my opponent to defend my arguments. My opponent started off by accusing me of not understanding opportunity cost. Let me assure him that I have quite a good idea of what opportunity cost means. He then brings in some technical terms with the hopes of confusing us to believe in him. Basically, he brushes off my argument which is the net high costs of remaining in the EU by accusing my data as biased and claiming that the opportunity of free trade justifies the cash. We have to remember that the costs of remaining in the EU have been rising STEADILY these past few years. If it has just been rising the last couple of years, yes, we might still be optimistic. But the truth is we are starting to question how much of a benefit this supposed free trade is when the figures have continuously been rising. When you consider that these costs are almost at par with medical costs in Britain, how long can we trick ourselves into thinking that ""you know, this is all for free trade. All this cost is justified."" And that is why I brought up the countries Norway and Switzerland. These countries are proof that you can stay out of the EU without having to succumb to membership fees. I was not at all implying that Britain should adopt a Nordic model. Of course, as a country with values of its own, they should negotiate a different treaty and a different model that suits them. Finally, I agree that America has no rights to comment on the Brexit. I was in no way implying that we should 'make Britain great again' as per Trump's model. And I never said that we should disallow refugees/migrants. I said that we should be able to draw our own laws up and not follow Brussel's laws, if for nothing else other than to maintain Britain's standing in the eyes of the world as an independent and strong nation. ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Now I will rebut my opponent's points. My opponent claimed that Britain throughout history has almost had strong ties with Europe and they have prospered. TO this argument, I will say that times have changed. When you look at how Greece, France and Spain's economies are struggling, you start to ask questions of how much longer Britain is expected to help out. My opponent then said Britain must not close its borders. Who said anything about closing borders?

brexit,"Con’s Case: Con more or less dropped all of his arguments, and due to a lack of response, conceded to my rebuttals. In reference to his opening arguments, Con only made reference to the fact that it is common knowledge that the EU constitution is much longer than the American one. However, that’s beside the point, I didn’t even dispute that. What I disputed was the assumption made by Con that, because it’s longer, it leads to more corruption, prevents Europeans from fighting for their rights, and causes the EU to trample on people’s rights. Without any evidence to that effect, there is absolutely no reason to believe it. No instances of EU corruption, no instances of Europeans being confused over their rights, and no instances of Europeans losing their personal rights were provided by Con. Thus, without evidence, he is simply speculating and making assumptions. Con did not once reference his open borders argument and his argument about the benefit of independence was linked into his rebuttal on my arguments, so I’ll address that there. As it stands, however, Con’s arguments remain absent of any evidence. Rebuttal 3-Benefits of Independence/Argument 1-Economic Effects: Con attempt to mitigate the economic downturn by arguing that Britain will benefit in the long term. However, the evidence here is still shaky and the benefits of independence are still not made clear. Con begins by emphasizing the fact he stated in the previous round that “there will be a storm before the clear.” That’s nice, but it doesn’t mean anything, it’s an empty statement. I can say “when things go bad, they keep getting worse.” Again, it doesn’t mean anything without anything to back it up. However, he is basing his argument on the idea that Britain will climb back to its pre-Brexit economic state and that this is better, because it will be independent. Con provides some level of evidence for this, which I will address later. However, I highlighted last round that Con didn’t provide a reason why it is better to be independent: “For instance, there is no reason to accept the premise that being an independent nation is better. He simply states it, along with brief mentions of freedom of speech, national border protection, and national pride. Border protection has already been discussed, but he doesn’t show how the EU suppresses Britain’s freedom of speech or national pride; Con also fails to demonstrate why either of those helps the UK.” I might as well say it is better for the UK to be part of the EU, because it becomes more integrated with the rest of Europe. No explanation as to why being more integrated with the rest of Europe is better for the UK, but it’s the same level of reasoning done by Con as to why Britain would be better off independent. As for evidence that the UK will recover, Con just tries to downplay the EU’s effect on the British economy. He takes a bird’s eye view of the fact that the majority of Britain’s trade comes from non-EU nations and that the other EU nations benefit too much from their trade with Britain. However, it is important to realize that being in the EU opens Britain up to trade with a lot more than just EU nations. I will refer back to my opening argument in which I reference the EU making deals with the US and Japan, and it was calculated that it would have likely ended up saving British households a total of £6.3B. (1) Also, to expand on that point, the deals with the US and Japan would have given British businesses easier access to U32; of the world’s market (by value). (2) However, those are only two examples of EU trade deals with international markets. In order to appropriately rebut Con’s point, I’ll give more examples of how being in the EU gives Britain access to more than just European markets. The EU has separate deals with over 50 countries. As of right now, EU trade deals account for 60% of British trade. (2) However, when you also consider deals the EU is currently negotiating (such as the aforementioned ones with the US and Japan), EU trade deals could eventually account for 88% of British trade. (2) Another major deal to consider is the EU’s deal with South Korea. Following the EU-SK deal, British trade with South Korea increased over 50%. (2) This is no suprise, as not only is South Korea a growing economy, the EU allowed it to be much easier to trade with the South Koreans. Also, the EU’s recently signed deal with Canada would have potentially raised trade with Canada 29%. (2) I could go into more depth, but it should be clear, that Con’s statement that “over half of their trade will go unaltered” is misinformed and flat out wrong. Con will likely rebut that Britain could just remake the trade deals it has, but that is a foolish idea. Looking at Canada (who only exports about 3.2% less than Britain in value), we can see they have a lot less trade deals than Britain (as a member of the EU). (2, 3) This should be obvious, as signing a deal with all of the EU economies is more attractive than just signing a deal with one economy. Also, Britain will not have nearly as much negotiating power. With the weight of all the EU economies, it is much easier to gain favourable deals. This is obvious, because the EU has much more to offer than an independent UK does. This is why stronger nations such as China in the China-Switzerland deal, South Korea in the SK-Australia deal, and the EU in the EU-SK deal, get better deals and have more ability to dictate terms. (2) Therefore, it is undeniable that the UK will be unable to sign trade deals as good as they had with the EU. Finally, I will respond to Con’s point that his example of Germany will want to continue having the same deals with the UK. My opening argument addressed this idea, and the study provided still predicted a 1.1% decline each year in GDP. (1) Why? Because as mentioned above, the EU is a much stronger negotiating party than the UK and the UK loses its other deals mentioned above. Plus, we need to remember that as the UK becomes more isolated, the rest of the world is still globalized. Using Con’s source, Britain’s exports to Germany can be analyzed. Transportation (e.g. cars, aircraft and vehicle parts, motorcycles, etc.) and machinery (e.g. engines, computers, and telephones) account for 17.94% and 20.04% of Britain's exports to Germany, respectively. (4) These are primarily manufacturing sectors, and there is no reason to keep manufacturing jobs, such as these, in the UK when they can easily be relocated. I included a quote in my opening argument which explained that an independent UK would have its own safety restrictions and regulations, as well, making it more complicated for most companies to operate in the UK. Obviously, these companies would rather focus their efforts on the European market than the British market. Plus, one has to consider London’s large financial sector. I also showed in my opening argument how many banks are considering moving much of their operations from London to Frankfurt. Again, this is obvious, the market is much larger in a EU nation like Germany than an independent UK. Overall, it can be concluded that the chances of Britain bouncing back to its previous economic levels is wishful thinking and there is no reason to believe the UK is better off independent, as Con provided no evidence to that effect. Thus, Brexit will undeniably hurt Britain’s economy in the short and long run, with no forseen benefits. Finally, I will once again bring up my immigration point from my opening argument, which Con never touched. With the likely decrease in immigrants, Britain will have immense strains on its pensions and healthcare, and iwll have less workers for future generations. Obviously, this hurts the UK in the long term. Argument 2-Scotland: Con says I lacked any evidence that a divide of the UK would be a bad thing. I’ll briefly expand on this idea. We are not arguing what’s best for the Scottish people, we are arguing what is better for the nation, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. That nation currently includes Scotland. The UK losing Scotland undeniably makes the UK less powerful, that’s just a simple numbers game. In other words, we don’t care about how good it is for Scotland, if it hurts Britain. Now, Con argues that for Britain, having a border with a EU nation, will help it. This may be true, but to effectively rebut this, we have to consider what Britain also loses from Scotland, which will just strengthen my economic argument. In 2014, Scotland’s exports were worth £76B and Britain's total exports were $473B. (5, 6) Using today’s conversation rate, Scotland accounted for over 20% of Britain’s total exports. However, it is even more important to consider what Scotland has. Scotland contains many minerals (such as coal), suitable land for agriculture, and North Sea oil (which Con makes reference to). (5) These natural resources (most notably the oil as petroleum accounts for 11.4% of the UK’s exports) are sectors that cannot be relocated like a car plant can, weakening Britain’s negotiating power, further abroad. (6) Therefore, it is clear a separate Scotland will hurt the UK. Conclusion: Without any evidence, Con’s arguments hold no weight and his rebuttals of mine were ultimately unconvincing. It has clearly been demonstrated that in the long run the UK’s economy will be hurt by leaving the EU, through the loss of favourable trade deals and the likely decline of immigration. Also, it has clearly been demonstrated that an independent Scotland would hurt the UK. For this reason, it is clear that passing Brexit was a mistake, and I urge voters to vote Pro.

brexit,"Good day to my formidable opponent and esteemed members of the jury. I would first like to thank my opponent for accepting this challenge and the judges for agreeing to vote on this debate. I will be arguing for the Brexit which is Britain leaving the EU. My stand is that ""leaving Europe is in the best interest of the British people"". I think everyone will agree that Britain is one of the most important countries in the world. It was once a great empire and it still continues to be a massive influence in terms of economy and military in Europe. For Britain to remain influential, it must not be restricted by the rules and laws drawn up by the European parliament in Brussels. An example of such laws that Britain has and will continue to have to abide to should they remain in the EU, are laws regarding trade. These past few years, Britain has had to contribute more and more financially into the EU purse for the benefit of enjoying free trade with members of the EU. If we look at the net sum, indeed Britain has lost money for the supposed benefit of business advantage. To put this figure into perspective, the net amount of money Britain has had to spent is slightly lower than the government's medical expenditure. To make matters worse, Britain is one of the countries which receives far less money from the EU with countries like Greece and France receiving much higher which is understandeable considering their economies are not doing too well. It is the believe of the instigator (which is me) in this debate that it is better for Britain to draw up new trade agreements with the EU without having to contribute to the 'kitty'. Why should Britain continue to be played as 'big brother' to bail out other countries? If Britain is out of the EU, yes they will still need to abide by EU laws to trade with the EU, but we find that this situation is not too far different from remaining in the EU and still having to abide by these laws while incurring a tonne of expense. Countries like Norway and Switzerland enjoy the benefits of European Free Trade while still keeping their dignity (for lack of a better word) as countries which are brave enough to stand alone. Secondly, the migrant crisis in Europe is going to impact Britain in a very damaging way. The instigator of this debate believes that the EU will at the very least, put pressure on Britain to accept large numbers of refugees should Britain remain in the EU. Countries like Sweden and Greece are already struggling with the influx of refugees with tens of thousands arriving on the borders every week. It is not so much an economical impact as it is a cultural one. I believe that Britain is not ready to be coerced to take in a large number of a foreign people. Even if Britain were to help out with the crisis, it must do so of it's own accord instead of being seen as meekly having to follow Brussels's orders. This will even create a precedent that migrants can simply enter and be relocated into countries of the EU, of which Britain would most likely be one of the main destinations because it's economy is one of the best among the EU countries. The GBP is a stronger currency than the Euro. Finally, I am going back to what I alluded to at the very start. It is time for Britain to stand alone just because it needs to. President Obama has called for Britain to remain in the EU. But the US would never choose to remain in a pact where it's powers will be far reduced. This is hypocritical of a country which wants to put up walls on the Mexico border. For Britain to be have a big say in economical, military and other matters not only in Europe but also globally it can no longer stand behind the shadow of the EU. Just like Russia, North Korea, China and even Iran who are global powers that are not afraid to stand alone, so to must Britain. We must stand behind the idea that Britain can stand for itself without the crutches of the EU. We must stand behind the idea that Britain can stand for itself without the restrictions of the EU. America and Germany want Britain to stay but that's a testament that they are afraid of Britain should it choose to go alone. I apologise if I have been considered to make arguments without the relevant links. I was writing this under some time constraint. Over to my opponent.",PRO,"Even if Britain were to help out with the crisis, it must do so of it's own accord instead of being seen as meekly having to follow Brussels's orders. ...

brexit,"Thank you so much for your great and well thought out points. I can see you did your research! I come from an outside point of view (meaning I am not a part of the UK), but I try to keep up with the affairs of the country since I intend to move there in the near future. I'll begin by acknowledging what you said about the economic downfall of the country as a whole due to the passing of Brexit. I believe you are absolutely right, and I will not contend your reasoning. What I will contend is the fact of a lack of faith in a country that could potentially become a great independent body. Let's talk a little bit about the EU. You said a lot of really nice things it does for the UK, but I believe those things are a temporary fix that hold certain consequences in exchange for the EU's services , meaning if the UK left the EU, the UK would eventually land back on its feet again, only without the crutch of the EU being there. In my understanding and research, the EU creates a bloated bureaucracy that just doesn't handle well when it comes to things such as border control, cultural defenses, and excessive regulation. It is a fair fear and logical one to be afraid of terrorism. Their open boarders were an issue. Put it this way: Imagine being an American and having open boarders, particularly after the scare of 9/11. It would be terrifying to say the least. So, of course, safety is an issue, especially when you are dependent on it, and the EU is doing a lousy job of isolating terrorism. An independent UK could provide this amenity so much better and more efficiently with control over its borders. Now I'd like to talk about documents. The EU's constitution is just...Well, huge. It's hundreds of pages long, very confusing, and it displays an almost sharia-like regulation on all aspects of human life. The lack of a real separation of powers invites the abuse of power, especially with a constitution that is so complex. Once again I am going to compare the EU's constitution to the US's constitution (I'm not being bias I promise, I just want to compare how the two work separately). The United States constitution works really well, and it is because it is very short and very easy to understand for all citizens so as to retain their rights and understand their government and privileges given to them. The United States is not a perfect country, but its citizens absolutely fight more for their rights because they know their constitution. The UK weening off of the EU gives them an opportunity to set up a much better and less corrupt/easy to corrupt constitution that enforces the main laws and that isn't dominated by lobbyists. The separation of powers is almost non existent it seems in the EU, and that leads for corruption. There are many different reasons for becoming an independent country, they can range from freedom of speech, to national boarder protection, to even having a national sense of pride. Being an Independent country is a beautiful and a well sought after ideal. I think that there is a mountain to get past that most people are to scared to go over, and that is the economic and relation- losing implications that come with leaving the EU, but sometimes you have to have a little vision of what the future can hold. All good things come after hardships, and to become an independent country, the UK will most certainly feel the brunt of their actions--at first, but as time goes on, the UK will form relations again, they are a well respected country that holds a lot of power in Europe. The economy will come back, and the people will be more independent, more free, and more able to establish themselves as an almost new country of sorts. If people could only look past the dark days, they would see a light at the end of the tunnel for the UK. I agree with you, the UK is going to hit some hard times...Some very hard times.

brexit,"Ok, let's agree with the opposition. Let's say that the costs incurred when Britain has to trade with each country separately is higher than the membership fee of being in EU. First of all, economic experts themselves cannot agree whether which scenario is going to incur more cost, especially when you consider that even if Britain does leave the EU it is going to take at least 2 years to gradually leave the EU and to finalise new laws and trade agreements. But when the problem is happening now, we cannot continue to ignore it without trying something new. Britain has been in the EU for too long and a new way of doing things, a change from the old ways deserve at least a 'trial period' to enable us to work things out. My opponent then argues terrorist ideas are home grown, not brought in and therefore an emphasis should be on the education system. I simply cannot agree with this. The fact that most terrorists have radical Islamic views are because they are from Islamic descent. To mitigate this problem, you can't bring in more people from Islamic countries (assuming this is Syria, Iraq etc) and expect that you know, nothing is going to happen and we're all going to live happy in a multicultural society. Which is exactly why, at this period in history with influx of migrants from Muslim countries, and Turkey trying to push their way to visa-free travel, we need to have more control over our borders. It is our concern that Brussels will force us to terms that will impact our community, particularly with regards to the public's sensitivity about muslims and terrorism. The fact that member states can share info to me is not at all a good reason to remain in the EU. The war on terrorism is a war fought collectively by all countries whether or not we remain in EU. America, Canada, Australia all non-EU countries contribute to our info on potential terrorist threats. And when we still cannot prevent incidents like that in Sydney and Paris, we should not pretend that just by sharing info we can solve terrorism altogether. Notice that I am not at all saying that all Muslims are terrorists. I am saying that we have to take the necessary precautionary steps with the knowledge that most terrorists are muslims. Britain leaving the EU does not mean we will leave our collective effort with other countries on the war on terrorism.

brexit,"I bid thank you to the fair proposition with their weak case, and loose ends. I stand on the opposition side for today, arguing for Britain to remain in the European Union (EU), I accept the definition given by the proposition on what Britain is, and will argue with the same spirit of the debate introduced, that whatever consensus that we come to, that it should be for the best interests of the British people. I will start with rebuttals, attempting to unravel the loose threads by the proposition. Firstly, when it comes to the matter of economics and specifically trade, it shows that the proposition had been brainwashed by Eurosceptics, with their fancy numbers that do not illustrate the real picture. The most basic concept in economics is opportunity cost, as long as the proposition do not understand this, and to and extent, the Eurosceptics, their figures should not be taken as an accurate representation of the costs incurred by remaining in the EU. The proposition talked about 'free trade' as it is something petty, when governments around the world are trying to lower transaction costs through Coase theorem in achieving Pareto efficiency. By remaining in the EU, Britain has free access to the single market without needing to negotiate treaties with respective countries they trade with. Yes, there would be issues that will arise when we remain in the EU, and I do not deny that, but I will continue with that rebuttal in my points as it relates a lot. The example of countries provided by the proposition is also very unfair, as it is very one sided and truthfully entirely irrelevant to the point that the instigstor is trying to make. Norway and Switzerland, yes, Switzerland, follow an economic model that is extremely unique, the Nordic Model. The Nordic Model follows the aspects of capitalism but is modified to comprise of socialist values. As that, to compare Britain and these Scandinavic economic countries is extremely irrelevant, as Britain follows a more liberal capitalistic economic values, and these values are not extinguished by remaining in the EU. On my last rebuttal, I will completely destroy the analogy given by the proposition when they brought the US into the fray, which ironically, happens today in reality. The Obama Administration has no rights to actively side for one segment of the referendum made for THE BRITISH. Also, as it is still called the Obama Administration, and not 'Trump Administration', it is unfair for the proposition to claim that the entire population of the great democracy that the US is, supports the building of this 'wall'. Also right, the hypocrite hear is actually the proposition, who wishes to build an artificial 'wall' by disallowing refugees to come in, what different is the instigator to the great Trump himself? Is the proposition's motto, ""Make Britain great again""? I assumed it is the refugee crisis that the proposition is referring to, as the migrant crisis and the refugee crisis are two different crises. Moving on to points. The first issue that we need to contend to is, the issue of multiculturalism. For that we need to go back to history. The British is not a people of its own, it is a creation of a cultural melting pot. The Celts, the Angles, the Saxons, the Frisians, the Normans, and to list all of them is just going to take very long, you get the point. Isolationist policies have never and should never be accepted by the British. A lot of Eurosceptics quote the moment when Europe was isolated from the rest of Catholic Europe during the Elizabethan Era and how they prospered. Again I must say, they were not isolationist at all, they were isolated, and because of that, they build trade partnerships with countries in the Mediterranean, and England prospered, not succumbed to recession. Still along the line of multiculturalism, the issue of migration must be be addressed. Be it the economic migrants, or the refugees seeking asylum, Britain must not close its borders. Let us first look into the issue of economic migrants. Only 44% of London's population are British Whites, and the rest are 'foreigners'. When the proposition made a very snarky remark, by saying that the migrant crisis, whichever that is, is very damaging to Britain, I felt that the instigator is being very insensitive. Not only that Britain is ready for foreigners, it also accepts these foreigners as a part of their own. Yes, there are bigots and dissenters who disagree, the proposition is obviously one, but the fact that the British people in itself is very multicultural, by closing our borders, we will just be going backwards. On the issue of refugees right, especially on refugees escaping Syria, it is very unfair for Britain, along with the EU, to disallow these refugees to seek refuge. It is no hidden secret, that the wars fought in Syria, is not a war by its own people anymore, but wars fought by foreigners, especially European powers. That is all for this round.",CON,"The Nordic Model follows the aspects of capitalism but is modified to comprise of socialist values. ... It is no hidden secret, that the wars fought in Syria, is not a war by its own people anymore, but wars fought by foreigners,",300
brexit,"Thank you good proposition. The issue I will adress now is the fact that there is strength in number. Firstly, when we talk about trade, supposedly right, that there are 'too much' costs that are incurred when Britain remains in the EU. Also, when the proposition is trying to talk about the economic benefits or costs, he/she should have basic understanding of economics itself, in line with political situations. Suppose that Britain leaves the EU, the cost they will incur to facilitate trade with respective countries that they trade with will be far more than the alleged value thay Britain is paying for its 'membership'. Also, when we talk about secuirty, Britain is actually much safer when they remain in the EU. Yes, the proposition might argue that by being in the EU, with its Schengen area, Britain cannot control its borders from the the threat of 'terrorists', but studies have shown, that these terroriet attacks, such as the Paris bombing, is homegrown. Yes, these 'terrorists' might be foreign in descent, but we cannot blame the immigration system for this. It is the issue of the educational system. How is Britain more secure by being in the EU? In terms of immigration itself, be it refugees or economic migrants, member states can share information and costs, and through distribution of costs, respective countries can achieve economies of scale through agglomeration. But this still does not answer how secure Britain can be. The Office for Budget Responsibility reports that much of public services are financed by taxes by immigrant workers. Also there's a high correlation economic growth with the level of immigration. This provide a security net for Britain in terms of its financial security. Talking about finances, leads to my next point, on the issue of services provided by Britian for the rest of EU, especially when we consider the fact that Britian is a service-based economy. The financial services centre in Britain employ around 2.1 million people, and this bulwark of the industry is stable mainly because of the EU internal market legislation. Investors do not mind takin risks, but looking at political uncertainty, and especially one with huge implications to the financial sector, they will be scared off. There's been talk of HSBC relocating its HQ away from London, and this will be made true, especially if Britain is to leave the EU, for gigantic multinational companies such as HSBC, prefers freer access to the market.

death penalty,"As you can see, my opponent has forfeited his last round. He also has not explained why any kind of death penalty, including the voluntary death penalty proposal I have provided, should be abolished or not exist. In fact, he completely ignored my main case for the debate of a voluntary death penalty. The topic of the debate is not the current death penalty in the United States. The topic is simply 'Death penalty' as you can see at the top of this page. Because my opponent did not specify the kind of death penalty, my opponent, under assumption, is against any kind of death penalty proposal. Yet, my opponent only argued against the current death penalty in the United States. My opponent did not make any case against my proposal of a voluntary death penalty. In fact, my opponent and I are both against the current death penalty in the United States. But my opponent did not specify that the debate revolved around the current death penalty, but any kind of death penalty. And because of this, my arguments are superior to his. Reasons for voting Pro: 1. Cost: A voluntary death penalty would be much cheaper than life in prison or even the current death penalty. My opponent has not denied this. 2. Deterrence of Crime: My opponent basically said that deterrence of crime is not why punishments are made. His argument against a death penalty is weak because basically any other form of punishment would not deter crime either. 3. International Law: My opponent argues that the current death penalty violates international law. However, the debate is not about the current death penalty, it is about any kind of penalty the invokes death. A voluntary death penalty would not only be in compliance with international law, but would give more personal liberty back to convict. My opponent did not deny this fact. 4. Risk of executing innocents: My opponent only gives a weak 10-word rebuttal to my proposal that a voluntary death penalty would make the issue of executing innocents moot. 5. Death sentences are racist and unfair: My opponent does not give any argument against my proposal that a voluntary death penalty would make the issue of racism in death penalties to also become moot. My opponent tries to refrain from the issue at hand and tries to say that the debate is about the current death penalty, which he never specified when I signed up for the debate. 6.

death penalty,"This debate will be on the death penalty. I will be arguing against the death penalty being a good thing. My opponent who will be 'pro' will argue in favour of the death penalty. Whoever my opponent will be I would like to wish them good luck and hope for an interesting and fun debate. Here is my reasoning on why the death penalty is a bad thing. One of the strongest reasons I think why the death penalty is a bad idea is the amount of innocent people that it has killed. The justice system is not perfect and many innocent people have been convicted by it, The problem with the death penalty is that there is no way to go back on sentences and fix mistakes when new information about a case is found. There have been a number of people in the US who have been sentenced to death who later have been found out to be innocent. If these people were just sent to prison these mistakes could have been reversed and fixed. Secondly I find the argument that the death penalty will deter crime to be a bad one. I feel that this is very logical. If someone is that messed up in the head to even consider killing someone or doing something equally as bad and inhumane, Do you really think that the prospect of death is going to deter them from doing it? Also, One thing that I've noticed many people who are in favour of the death penalty don't realise is that the death penalty is in fact very expensive. According to the Death Penalty Information Centre, In the US the average costs for a non-death penalty murder case is $1. 1 million ($870, 000 in imprisonment, $250, 000 in trial), While the average costs for a death penalty case are $3 million ($1. 3 million in imprisonment, $1. 7 million in trial). For these reasons and more I strongly believe that the death penalty is a bad thing and should absolutely be repealed in countries that it is implemented in such as the US. https://deathpenaltyinfo.

death penalty,"""Lol you argue what is happening now. Also it was implied the current system is used in this debate."" My opponent has failed to explain why any kind of death penalty should be abolished. My opponent did not specify before the debate started that the topic of death penalty was only limited to its current use in the United States. My opponent wishes to make known of his intentions AFTER the debate started. I find this to be an irresponsible condition opposed upon me by my opponent because I accepted this debate only on the conditions of which were supplied at the time of acceptance. At the time, I was accepting the position of 'Pro' for A death penalty. Notice how neither the title of the debate nor anything written in the comments section before the debate started includes anything specific that says ""Resolved: The current death penalty system instituted in the United States should be abolished"". I am within my bounds to be arguing for a death penalty, not THE death penalty. In this case, I would like to supply some definitions: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Death - a permanent cessation of all vital functions : the end of life [1] Penalty - 1. A legal sentence. 2. A punishment for violating rules of procedure. [2] Punish - to subject to pain, loss, confinement, death, etc., as a penalty for some offense, transgression, or fault: to punish a criminal. [3] Voluntary - done, made, brought about, undertaken, etc., of one's own accord or by free choice: a voluntary contribution. [4] Recidivism - the act of a person repeating an undesirable behavior after they have either experienced negative consequences of that behavior, or have been treated or trained to extinguish that behavior. [6] ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ The definition of a death penalty can be construed from the definitions above as a legal sentence subjecting a person to death. My stance on the subject of a death penalty is that a death penalty should remain in the United States, but it should be entirely different than the current death penalty. A decision to undergo the death penalty should be a voluntary choice made by a convict who would have the option of life in prison or death. I have no doubt that a portion of criminals sentenced to life in prison would rather opt for the death penalty than a life sentence. This is evident by the fact that a large number of murder-suicides occur in the United States in which after a person commits murder, they take their own life. The source and evidence for this argument is listed in the first round of the debate. R1: Cost ""SO your ""the defendant chooses"" is false. The judge in the end chooses, defendant just gets to plea to try to weaken the sentence."" It is most definitely not false. In a voluntary death penalty, the defendant WOULD be able to choose. Remember, the argument is not about the current US death penalty, but is about A death penalty. So it is the trial itself under the DP that is expensive. That is what I have said all along. A voluntary death penalty would eliminate the bulk of the cost that it takes to execute a criminal because the legal appeals process which costs the most money would be eliminated. The appeals process exists because convicts who are fighting the state do not want to receive the death penalty. The people who would fight the death penalty in the future would not be sentenced to the death penalty in a voluntary death penalty, they would be sentenced to life in prison, therefore eliminating the appeals process in death penalties that costs the most amount of money in the current death penalty in the US. Also you concede that the DP costs more. I stated that the current death penalty costs more. A voluntary death penalty would cost so much less than the current death penalty, and would cost less than life in prison simply because the costs for food, health and shelter would amount to $0 after the criminal is executed. The states would actually save $1.5 million in living costs per convict if the convict opts for the voluntary death penalty over life in prison [5]. R2: The death penalty does not deter crime. The act of deterring crime is not the primary purpose of creating and enforcing rules for punishing lawbreakers. Fantastic. Then if deterrence isn't a major issue in deterring crime, then why are you debating that the death penalty doesn't deter crime if any other form of punishment isn't made to deter crime either? If the sole purpose of rules of law aren't even made to deter crime, you have just defeated your own argument. You make it seem that deterrence is a negligible issue. R3: The DP infringes international law. I agree with your statements on the current death penalty. But not all death penalties would violate this law. A voluntary death penalty would allow a convict to have more personal liberties than the current death penalty and a convict would also have the right to life or death based on his choice. R4: Risk of executing innocents I fail to see how an innocent person would want to opt for death under a voluntary death penalty. Even so, it's a person's right to life or death and a government shouldn't be infringing on 'international law' that you cite in this debate because it would infringe on liberty of the person to govern their own body. R5: Death sentences are racist and unfair ""Lol you argue what is happening now. Also it was implied the current system is used in this debate."" Like I said above, I am arguing for A death penalty, not the current death penalty. You did not specify that as a condition of the debate when I accepted the debate. Therefore you MUST convince the voters that the United States would be better off without a death penalty, and I am convincing the voters that the United States would be better with A death penalty. Notice that the topic is simply 'Death Penalty' and that you did not provide any additional information to what your resolution was for the debate. Therefore I am obligated to argue within my bounds, and my bounds are that I am arguing for a Death Penalty in the United States. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ In conclusion, the United States would be better off with a voluntary death penalty than without one at all. - It would be cheaper than life imprisonment by saving 1.5 million dollars per inmate. - It would give the convict the right to make a decision on their continuation of life. - It would eliminate the possibility of the criminal from being released back into society and committing recidivism. Voters: Because the debate resolution later admitted by my opponent was not provided at the beginning of the debate, I strongly urge you to base your decision on who convinced you more on the argument that a death penalty of some kind is better or worse than any kind of death penalty at all. I hope that after reviewing all of the debate, you make the right decision and vote Pro! :) Sources: 1. http://www.merriam-webster.com... 2. http://en.wiktionary.org... 3. http://dictionary.reference.com... 4. http://dictionary.reference.com... 5. http://www.heartsandminds.org... 6. http://en.wikipedia.org...",PRO,The source and evidence for this argument is listed in the first round of the debate. ... :) Sources: 1. http://www.merriam-webster.com... 2. http://en.wiktionary.org... 3. http://dictionary.reference.com... 4.,305
death penalty,"Though there are people who say that the death penalty is cruel and unusual, there are the facts that the possibility of the death penalty actually does cross most criminals minds before committing a murder. In an article by Michael Kronenwetter, the facts are clear about the death penalty, ""In the early 1970s, the Los Angeles Police Department conducted interviews with 99 criminals who had not carried lethal weapons when they committed their crimes. According to the police, roughly half gave fear of the death penalty as the reason for their decision to reject weapons."" The criminals who decided to not carry lethal weapons when they committed their crimes because of the fear of the death penalty. The threat of a possibility of being sentenced to death for crimes that a person commits proves that the death penalty may be cruel and unusual but very affective. Kronenwetter, Michael.

death penalty,"The death penalty is useless. It is morally wrong, inefficient, and observably ineffective in accomplishing several key goals. Historically, there have been five presumably legitimate purposes for punishment: (1) Retribution, (2) Deterrence, (3)Rehabilitation, (4)Incapacitation, and (5)Public Education. [1] For a punishment to be morally permitted, it must justify itself by fulfilling at least one of the aforementioned criteria. The death penalty is justified only under one criterion, and that criterion is not enough by itself to justify any punishment. (1) Retribution The death penalty does provide retribution. It provides retribution at a cost of an additional $90,000 per inmate on death row. [2] Life imprisonment is less costly, and an equally valid form of retribution. Even assuming that retribution is valid, the death penalty is still inefficient compared to life sentencing, an equally valid alternative. Where two processes are proposed to meet the same end, assuming the same result, the more efficient process should be favored. Life imprisonment and the death penalty both remove the freedom of an individual to act. One method is simply more costly and eliminates all of the offender's potential value. Therefore, the death penalty is the worse of two methods of accomplishing the same ends, and must be discredited under a theory of retribution. (2) Deterrence The death penalty does not deter. [3] (3) Rehabilitation The death penalty does not rehabilitate, obviously. (4) Incapacitation The death penalty does incapacitate. Incapacitation, however, is an invalid goal by itself. If incapacitation alone could justify the death penalty, then it would be proper to extend it to every instance of every criminal act ever conducted. After all, the argument goes, they wouldn't reoffend. Similarly, most people who argue for prison reform are concerned for rising costs. Life imprisonment is just as valid a form of incapacitation. It is also less costly. If incapacitation is the goal, then life imprisonment is still the better alternative. (5) Public Education If the death penalty does educate the public, it doesn't do it in the way it aims to. [4] [5] By increasing the incidence of homicide, the death penalty clearly could not accomplish its ends under this criterion. Conclusion The death penalty is therefore not justified. If the death penalty is not justified, it is the unjustified taking of another's life. The unjustified taking of another's life is murder. Murder is morally wrong. Therefore, the death penalty is morally wrong. The death penalty is therefore inefficient, ineffective and morally wrong. It should be discarded. Sources [1] http://www.wcl.american.edu...

death penalty,"Thank you for replying. I was afraid you had permanently terminated your account. C1: Cost I believe that cost is an important factor in determining whether or not the death penalty should remain a part of the judicial system in the United States. Under the current system, the costs for life imprisonment is far less expensive than it is to institute the death penalty. This is because many defendants do not want the death penalty and will fight state governments for a long as 10 years, costing money in criminal trials, like you said, up to a total of $3 million dollars. But the fact is, the death penalty doesn't have to be mandatory. If the option between life in prison or the death penalty is given to the defendant, a large amount of money can be avoided from defendants fighting off the death penalty in courts. If the defendant opts for life in prison, the state will save 8 times the amount of money per case by avoiding a death penalty trial, since most of the money spent in a death penalty case is spent on the trial alone, not on the actual execution [1]. You may be wondering why criminals would even want the option to the death penalty, like I have mentioned. Sometimes ""[criminals] feel it is an act of kindness to them. The argument here is - Is life imprisonment a crueler fate?"" [2] And often times criminals see death as a way to escape their guilt. If you look at statistics for murder suicides in the United States, 1,000 to 1,500 murder-suicides occur every year [3]. If the murderers were caught before they took their own life, I would be certain that they would want to seek the death penalty, rather than life in prison. This is based on the fact that if they didn't want to die, they didn't have to kill themselves. But because they killed themselves, they were seeking death. C2: The death penalty does not deter crime. The death penalty does deter crime because offenders will not be able to repeat their offense once they are dead. In your solution for deterring crime, you suggest that murder rates can be ""curbed by addressing the environmental and social factors that contribute to violent crime"" and then cited a quote that ""The murder rate is most closely associated with the socioeconomic health of the country. The murder rate in the U.S. was highest during the Depression."" I ask you this one question: Does the fact that the economy is bad gives criminals the right to commit murders? Your proposed alternative to the death penalty is to address the environmental and social factors that contribute to violent crime. If the government can't fix the economy, and a bad economy (like you have mentioned) is responsible for higher murder rates, it would be impossible to address the issues that contribute to crime, and crime would flourish if the environmental and social factors can't be addressed. Therefore, your solution to preventing crime is much less effective at doing so than a voluntary death penalty or even the current one under effect in the US. C3: The DP infringes international law. You mentioned in the comments section of this debate that this was about a death penalty in the United States. Regarding a death penalty, it is perfectly legal in the United States under the 5th amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Why should international law matter when you said this debate was in regard to the United States? C4: Risk of executing innocents Under a voluntary death penalty, this would no longer become an issue. C5: Death sentences are racist and unfair Under a voluntary death penalty, death sentences would not be given out by the state government, but would be given by the defendant. It would be up to the defendant to choose life in prison or the death penalty. ------------------------------ My opponent finished his 1st round of the debate by arguing that the death penalty is ""unfair, kills innocents, and doesn't even serve it's deterrence purpose, and on top of that is is expensive"". But what my opponent ignores is that the death penalty can still exist without causing all of those things to happen. A voluntary death penalty, one which the defendant can choose over life imprisonment, will negate the issue of what is fair or isn't fair because grand juries will no longer be sentencing defendants to the exact form of punishment, but will hand over the option of death to the defendant. A voluntary death penalty will negate the issue of killing innocents. It will be up to the defendant to decide whether his death is right for him or not. And while my opponent argues that the death penalty does not deter criminals from committing crimes, he does not provide a viable solution that does deter criminals from committing crimes. And when my opponent says that the death penalty is expensive, he ignores how expensive it would be to improve environmental and social factors in the United States, a solution he offers as a way to deter crime in America. A voluntary death penalty would be much more cheaper because the defendant would not be resisting death if he opts for the death penalty over life in prison, thus avoiding a lengthy, expensive chain of criminal trials for 1 single defendant.

death penalty,"The United States has several ways on how criminals should be punished. The most important punishments are serving time in prison and the death penalty. The death penalty is the worst punishment that a judge could sentence a defendant. The death penalty should be removed from the punishments the United States provides for its defendants, because in many cases it is not a 100% chance that the defendant did in fact commit the crime. In cases where the defendant actually did commit the crime, they should still be convicted a life sentence in prison, rather than the death penalty. If the death penalty is sentenced to a defendant, who according to evidence presented in court did in fact commit the crime, instead of this being the worst thing that could ever happen, it could be an easy way out; the defendant to not serve a life sentence. When it comes to money, the United States may be spending more per having prisoners serve life sentences, then sentencing the life sentence. However, the death penalty is still not a way of justice. The death penalty is a waste of taxpayers' money, and has no public safety benefit. Instead, the death penalty has a main motive of revenge, instead of justice. The death penalty can be considered as violating the U.S. Constitution, because it is considered a cruel and unusual punishment, and the guarantees of the due process of law and of equal protection under the law are violated. The States should not give themselves the right to kill human beings, whatever the crime may have been, it is much more revenge than it is justice. According to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the majority of the law enforcement professionals, surveyed agree that capital punishment does not deter violent crime; a survey of police chiefs nationwide found they rank the death penalty lowest among ways to reduce violent crimes. It is obvious that even law enforcement professionals do not agree with the death penalty. The death penalty does not stop crimes that continue in the streets every day, it only kills one human being who may have committed the crime they are being accused of. If money is the issue for having too many prisoners, there is such a thing as rehabilitation centers, which is what prisons are sentenced certain amount of time to serve in the first place. It is much better to have someone spend their life in prison, rather than giving them the easy way out through the death penalty. The doubt of someone actually committing the crime they are being accused of, and going forward with the death penalty is a doubt that will not go away. The fact that an innocent human being was sentenced to the death penalty is a life that is lost and cannot be gained back. The fatal constitutional infirmity in the punishment of death, is that it treats members of the human race as nonhuman, as objects to be toyed with and discarded. Lives should not be toyed with when facing a severe punishment as the death penalty. Aside from the death penalty being the worst punishment, the need for a physician to be present to conduct the procedure is in violation of the oath they take upon, which is to protect lives; this erodes public confidence in the medical profession. The use of a physician's clinical skill and judgment for purposes other than promoting an individual's health and welfare undermines a basic ethical foundation of medicine, which is to do no harm. Instead of the death penalty being a way of stopping crimes, the fact that one person is being named for committing a crime is not accurate, it violates the Constitution, and more importantly those physicians who are certified to save lives , are going against their oath and helping with the prosecution.",CON,"When it comes to money, the United States may be spending more per having prisoners serve life sentences, then sentencing the life sentence. ... If money is the issue for having too many prisoners, there is such a thing as",310
death penalty,"To answer Pro's question in round one, we are talking about the state system. Argument 1: Costs The death penalty often makes cases much more costly than similar non-death penalty cases. For example, a 2003 legislative audit in Kansas found that the costs for a single death penalty case was 70 percent more than a comparable non-death penalty case in the state; for general statistics, death penalty case costs (median costs $1.26 million) were counted through to execution, while non-death penalty costs were counted to the end of incarceration (median costs $740,000) [1]. At trial level cases in Washington state, death penalty cases generate roughly $470,000 in additional costs to the prosecution and defense over the cost of trying the same case as an aggravated murder without the death penalty, which costs at most $70,000 for court personnel [2]. Enforcing the death penalty costs Florida $51 million a year above what it would cost to punish all first-degree murderers with life in prison without parole; based on the 44 executions Florida had carried out since 1976, that amounts to a cost of $24 million for each execution; in Texas, a death penalty case costs an average of $2.3 million, about three times the cost of imprisoning someone in a single cell at the highest security level for 40 years; the most comprehensive study in the country found that the death penalty costs North Carolina $2.16 million per execution over the costs of sentencing murderers to life imprisonment [3]. I could continue quoting statistics, but I think my basic point has been made; more examples can be found at sources [3] and [4]. The death penalty should not be considered cost effective. Argument 2: Deterrence of crime The death penalty can be a terrifying punishment, and it would be rational to think it acts as a deterrence to certain criminal activity; this is generally not the case, and one can deduce this through rational thinking and a look into statistics. People with mental illnesses, people absolutely enraged, people panicking, and people under the influence of drugs, such as alcohol, are not likely to take the death penalty in mind when committing a crime that may warrant the death penalty. Almost one in four victims of violent crime report that the perpetrator had been drinking before committing the violent crime [5]. Between 31 percent and 36 percent of prisoners convicted of a violent crime against an intimate reported that they were drinking alcohol at the time of the offense; these figures rise to approximately 50 percent when reports from those who were consuming both alcohol and drugs at the time of the offense are considered [5]. Furthermore, research has shown nearly all death row inmates suffer from brain damage because of trauma or illness, while 5 to 10 percent of death row inmates suffer from serious mental illness [6]. The death penalty, if meant to deter certain extreme crimes, has a very difficult time doing so, since those who commit these extreme crimes are not likely to consider the death penalty when committing their crimes. Furthermore, murder rates in non-death penalty states are consistently lower than the murder rates in death penalty states, suggesting that the death penalty fails to deter murder [7]. This even applies to specific cases where a death penalty state and a non-death penalty state border each other. For example, Iowa, a non-death penalty state that borders Missouri, a death penalty state, has a lower murder rate than Missouri [8]. The source, link below, provides further examples. This means that the trend that death penalty states have a higher murder rate than non-death penalty states remains consistent, regardless of the general location of the states. Now, this does not mean that the death penalty does not deter any crimes. That said, I have already presented statistics of the costs because of the death penalty. My opponent would have to show that the death penalty deters enough crime to justify the amount of money spent on death penalty cases and trials each year, when this money could be used for other crime control measures that could be more effective. If he fails to do so, then the death penalty should not be considered an effective way for the states to use when trying to control or reduce crime. Argument 3: Innocence Out of the over 1,000 people executed since 1976, it is difficult to determine who was truly innocent. That said, humans are fallible; thus, it is possible for human beings to make a mistake in trials involving the death penalty, which means innocent people could be executed. Most courts generally do not entertain the possibility that they executed an innocent person, while defense attorneys focus their attention on clients' who can be saved. If a person is sentenced to a lifetime of prison, and if new evidence for their innocence is revealed while serving their time, then they could be released. With the death penalty, the innocent person cannot be brought back to life; similarly, people cannot be given back their time that was lost serving their sentence, but being dead is much worse. Since the rounds are not particularly structured and Pro shall have an opportunity each round to respond to my arguments, I retain the right to introduce new arguments later on in the debate. For the time being, however, I shall let Pro state his arguments in favor of the death penalty while responding to mine. Nonetheless, I have argued that the death penalty is not cost effective while also arguing that it is not an effective deterrent of crime. Furthermore, I have argued that the possibility of innocents dying in an imperfect system should make the death penalty unacceptable. My job was to argue against the legalization of the death penalty, and I have done so. [1] http://www.amnestyusa.org... [2] http://deathpenalty.procon.org... [3] http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org...

death penalty,"Opening Arguments : The system of law and order is all about justice but where do draw the line to were we become the very evil we wish to destroy. Murder is murder and capital punishment is just that murder, simple to just kill killers but what does that make you? It makes you a killer but with public opinion on your side and a notion of justice which isn't the case. Why is it that America holds a sanctity for life, and yet kill people for killing people how does that make sense its hypocritical. Case: 1. The death penalty can and has killed innocent people, the government has killed innocents making it murder. Under the death penalty rules technically all the people in the cases with innocent people killed should themselves be put on trial and killed. However it doesn't work that way, the accused is the only one getting blamed for a crime and if innocent but proven guilty will get the death penalty but then proven innocent after the sentence has already been carried out the government just goes oops sorry. 2. Death penalty cost more than life in prison without parole. Evidence : Dudley Sharp, Death Penalty Resources Director of Justice For All (JFA), in an Oct. 1, 1997 Justice for All presentation titled ""Death Penalty and Sentencing Information,"" wrote: ""Many opponents present, as fact, that the cost of the death penalty is so expensive (at least $2 million per case?), that we must choose life without parole ('LWOP') at a cost of $1 million for 50 years. Predictably, these pronouncements may be entirely false. JFA estimates that LWOP cases will cost $1.2 million - $3.6 million more than equivalent death penalty cases. There is no question that the up front costs of the death penalty are significantly higher than for equivalent LWOP cases. There also appears to be no question that, over time, equivalent LWOP cases are much more expensive... than death penalty cases. Opponents ludicrously claim that the death penalty costs, over time, 3-10 times more than LWOP.""

death penalty,"Since my opponent gave his speech first, my burden is to merely disprove my opponent's arguments. My opponents case: 1. I will go over my opponent's cost argument after I go over my opponent's other arguments. 2. Innocence My opponent goes over the argument that the death penalty could possibly lead to the death of innocent people. He uses the quote from Governor George Ryan. My opponent goes on and states that innocent people have been released from death row. However, here is a statistic. According to author Thomas Eddlem, ""...the most important error rate—the rate of mistaken executions—is zero."" This shows that no one who has been executed on death row has been proven innocent after their death. Therefore, the death penalty is in fact argument. Even if you do not buy this argument, here is another one. Those who have been let off death row have been proven innocent from the arrival of DNA testing. These innocents were convicted during times when there was no DNA testing, and its arrival in the 90's vindicated them. However, if we look forward to the future we can see that DNA testing is already in place, and this will make sure that we can convict the right person. Our reliance on circumstantial evidence will decrease, and we can be certain that we are executing the guilty. Finally, those who are in fact convicted are given due process of the law and are convicted by a jury of their peers. 3. Death Penalty does not help anything My opponent says that the death penalty states do not have lower crime rates, and that states that do not have the death penalty have low crime rates. However, this is a flawed argument. First, because my opponent is looking at the whole crime rate. However, since the death penalty punishes only crimes involving murder, then we cant expect the death penalty to deter crimes that do not involve murder. Second, because my opponent is comparing non death penalty states and death penalty states. However, these states are not all alike. For example, most of the death penalty states have large urban populations, while most of the non death penalty states do not. Therefore, we must look at a different way to see if the death penalty does in fact deter crime. This method that I will show compares homicide rates nation wide between years that had the death penalty and years that did not. This study can be found here http://www.johansens.us.... In this study author Jay Johansen looked at the homicide rates since 1950. In this study he found that the homicide rate was lower in years when the death penalty was used, than in years when the death penalty was in fact not in use. Therefore, we can clearly see that the death penalty is a deterrent of homicides, which is the type of crime it punishes. 4.)To my opponent's fourth point I say no. This is because this threat of death is classified as coercion. Hence, people are more likely to do what you want, in this case not commit murder, because they are afraid of the possible punishment of death they will face. Sure, spending life in prison would be bad, but you are still alive. You are still able interact with human beings, and are able to even perform some activities while in prison. However, it has been statistically proven that the death penalty has deterred people from committing violent crimes. 5.) To my opponent's fifth point I agree. Just like I agree that the person who killed another man in self defense is a murderer . However, we as a society do not punish this man for protecting himself. Just like the government should not be punished for protecting its people by using the death penalty. As well, if you look at the Social Contract theory, that the government has the complete right to murder this man by not following the law. You can label the state a murderer, but that does not mean they are wrong. 1.) Finally, I will go back to my opponent's first point. My opponent states that death penalty cases cost more. I will show you in two ways how this argument is flawed. First, since it has been shown that the death penalty does in fact deter crime I will play off this argument. My opponent since he is advocating no death penalty at all we will see a rise in the homicide rate. This is true because it has been shown statistically that the homicide rate was higher in years without executions. This rise in the homicide rate will require the state to spend even more money on prosecution of these homicides, and the investigations of these homicides. This will cause the money the state though they would save each case without the death penalty, to in fact be used. In fact, this would cause more and more money to be spent, and the state would not save any money at all. Even if you do not buy this argument you should look at my next argument. My second argument is that this immaterial. As author Thomas Eddlem said, ""Justice isn't up for sale to the lowest bidder."" Therefore, the government must do what it is obligated to its citizens first, and worry about cost second. Since my opponent has no arguments left, I have successfully upheld my burden and you must now vote pro. I would also like to thank my opponent for a great debate, and I await his response.",PRO,"However, if we look forward to the future we can see that DNA testing is already in place, and this will make sure that we can convict the right person. ...

We can all agree that the death penalty (like a lethal shot) is much more humane than a public hanging, or even a private hanging for that matter. 2) Also, the death penalty is a much less costly way to deal with criminals than a life sentence.

death penalty,"There are many reasonable arguments against the death penalty. However, we are dealing with a life and death issue. When dealing with an issue of this magnitude I believe there should be great consequences. Statistics reveal that the death penalty is very costly. I think that when an issue regards human life all costs must be put aside. The actions that lead to the death penalty further justify the reason to put the aside the price. As a nation, the United States has a priority to stand by people and their rights. A nation that solely focuses on cost is a nation that does not have its priorities in line. Being a nation of the people, I think we must stand beside the victims and protect their violated rights. The 15th amendment states that ""no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law"" (US Constitution). Simply, without the due process of law a person can not be deprived of their natural rights. This amendment stands alongside the victims. If a criminal is willing to interfere, break the law and deprive a person of their rights, I believe they should be punished to the maximum extent. If murderers do not value the rights of others, they should not be allowed to have those rights for themselves. Along with serving justice, the death penalty focuses on reasonable retribution. In order to be in consideration to earn the death penalty, a person must go to great measures to break laws. In the state of Texas to get the death penalty you must have committed a murder of a public officer, multiple persons, a person under 16 years of age and during a felony. Committing a murder in the first degree in Florida makes a person eligible for the penalty (Death Penalty Information Center). What it takes to be deserving of the punishment are the most ruthless and gruesome of crimes. The death penalty takes the lives of inhuman killers and law breakers. Not your everyday shoplifters and car thieves are prosecuted to receive the death penalty. Only the most extreme of criminals are eligible for the punishment. I believe that an extreme law breaker should be punished in an extreme manner. Jails and prisons are for people to be rehabilitated. Death is for those who commit the few and most dangerous of laws.",PRO,"The 15th amendment states that ""no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law"" (US Constitution). ...

death penalty,"The idea that the death penalty is unjustified on lower crimes is not the topic of today's debate. The parameters set was the death penalty, which means that any strain of the death penalty can be defended. In this instance, murder/rape only is a reasonable standard to weigh the death penalty on. The claim made that someone was killed for being alone in a mall can be assumed to be either misinterpreted or false. Since my opponent does not mention a case, and since being alone in a mall is not a crime, that was obviously not the reason for the charge. My opponent also claims the death penalty increases the crime rate and cites the discovery channel. However, actual studies in the US, which due to their accuracy on US politics ought to be preferred, show that the death penalty is a DETERRENT for crime. (Ex:http://abc7news.com...) This is extremely important as it shows that the death penalty is not a way to seek revenge by the state, as stated by my opponent, but rather way to save net lives. I addressed this point in my last speech, but my opponent did not address it which means that it is still relevant in today's round. My opponent looks at conversion as the only evidence to claim that crime is reduced in nations without the death penalty. Yet, they offer no conversion rates or evidence for this beyond their own words.

Death penalty should exist because when someone commits a crime that's so violent the end result can cause hundreds to die. If there is no death penalty then the maniac will still kill more people. Death penalty is used to get rid of bad people so bad that hundreds die. If you think the Death penalty is bad because it kills people you must not know what the purpose of it is. The death penalty is a way to put fear into the criminal and to put fear into others. Crime has decreased and the death penalty still lives. Several tests have shown that the death penalty is an effective deterrent of future crimes. Do people who commit heinous crimes, such as the bombers, really have human rights. To say that we are lowering ourselves to that level is wrong. Killing over 200 innocent lives. We have to look as well at the possibilities of these criminals committing crimes again. In Australia murder, on average, is imprisonment for 12 years. This means many murders are set free, able to commit further crimes. Benefits of death penalty - decreases jail over population - puts fear into other criminals and shows a purpose - It avenges innocent lives - It decreases crime.

One small but important reason on why the death penalty is a good idea is that it decreases the prisoner population, which saves even more tax payers money. Another reason why the death penalty is a good idea, Once a criminal is executed, he cannot kill again.

death penalty,"I offer my thanks to my opponent for his quick reply. However, I do hope he actually reads my sources. I am not simply making statements devoid of supportive data. ""Life imprisonment is less costly?"" Yes. [1] Life imprisonment is less costly for a variety of reasons, far beyond lethal injection costs. It is more costly because of a lengthy appeals process. It is more costly because you can not free a dead man, which means that all appeals must be exhausted before sentencing is carried out. It is more costly because a person who is to be executed needs to be guarded more closely. It is more costly because someone dies, and that costs a life. ""Imagine how much more money this country would save if we put our murderers to death the moment they are convicted of the crime."" This is a separate argument for the death penalty. It is one of modification rather than continuation. I will answer it regardless, but I fail to see how it supports your resolution that the death penalty remain in the United States. Would we save money if we immediately killed those convicted of murder the first time, assuming no appeal? Yes. We would also have a 12% chance of killing an innocent. [2] That would just be murder sanctioned by the state. Furthermore, it is unconstitutional. You can not deprive a person of life or liberty without applying due process of the law. [3] That includes the appeals process. You are claiming that the death penalty should be modified so that it can be a justified expense in the United States. However, the way you have gone about justifying it is completely un-American. """"The death penalty does not deter."" Says you? I am pretty sure that is a matter of opinion."" It is a matter of fact. In every state that has abolished the death penalty, murder rates have decreased. This is not proof that the death penalty causes murder. It is however proof that there is no correlation between the death penalty and the prevention of murder. Deterrence **is only evident** if there is a correlation between implementation and prevention. Clearly, there is not. [4] ""The death penalty would in fact prevent more people from being murdered."" It does not. If you live where the death penalty is applied, you are more likely to be killed than if you did not. See above. ""In the end you are saving more lives then you are killing."" A murderer does not get to justify his murders by saying they were mostly bad guys. Neither should the state. ""The overall murder rate jump doesn't prove that the death penalty doesn't work the way its supposed too, that is do to a multiple of different factors including the moral decline of the U.S."" Please explain the source of the purported moral decline of the United States.

death penalty,"I can understand a victim's family's frustration at the thought of a killer getting away with what he has done. This seems to be what so many think happens when a killer avoids the death penalty. I will argue that not only is the death penalty not effective in preventing crime or bringing a victim back but is nothing but a costly state funded revenge killing. (1)Detterance Some will argue that the death penalty helps keep murder rates down by scaring would be criminals, at the thought of being put to death, into not commiting hard crimes. The theory goes that if one is about to murder someone he/she might be persuaded not do so out of fear that he will be put to death. This is definitely not the case. From 2003-2008 there were thirty countries in the world who had murder rates of 1.5 or less murders in every 100,000 people. Of these thirty, twenty had completely abolished the death penalty while ten still have the death penalty partially or fully in place.[1] Surely if the death penalty really had a deterring effect, there would be more countries in the top thirty with the death penalty than without. Iceland, a country that has abolished the death penalty, has the overall lowest murder rate in the world.[1] (2)Costs In California, taxpayers pay an estimated $90,000 more per death row prisoner each year than on prisoners in regular confinement. Just in California, if the death penalty were changed to life without parole, California taxpayers could save 125.5 million dollars annually.[2][3] This is because, when the death penalty is being seeked, after being convicted of the crime, the suspect must go through a very long process of appeals and sentencing to make sure he/she is not convicted of a crime he/she did not commit. This coupled with the arbitrariness of a punishment which neither rehabilitates criminals nor prevents crime makes the death penalty not worth it . (3)Arbitrariness Again, the death penalty does not really punish someone in that they are out and dead in 1, 2, 3. That is it, no more punishment after that. They basically get away with it like Hitler. Second, this does nothing to benefit society in the longrun. You could say that it takes out dangerous criminals. But can't we do that anyways by putting them in prison for life for a fraction of the cost? And doesn't it seem like a far worse punishment to sit and rot in a prison until you die in ripe old age then to go out in a second and be free from all responsibility? (4)Wrong guy There is also the possibility that one could be killed while being innocent. If we find out that a man was wrongly convicted of murder even ten years after the case, at least that man can one day walk out of prison. If that man was put to death on the other hand, all you can do is apologize to the suspect's family and apologize for killing an innocent and slandering his name. There are no backsies when it comes to the death penalty. My main reasoning stands that: A-The death penalty, contrary to what many say, has not been shown to deter criminals from commiting crimes. B-The cost of the death penalty is much higher than to put a person in prison for life. This is a complete waste of hundreds of millions of dollars of tax payer money. This money could be better used for rehabilitation or to help stop crimes before they happen. C-It is a much more effective punishment to make someone rot in a tiny cell for fifty years then to shut off their lights in a few seconds. D-There is no fixing a mistake like killing the wrong guy.

One mistake i made is that in some cases the death penalty is not COMPLETELY painless, but i was wanting to make the point that in most cases, it's less painful than a lot of deaths. ""The death penalty is a misuse and waste of taxpayer dollars"". So you are saying that sentencing someone to the death penalty uses to many tax payers dollars, so keeping them in prisons and feeding them three meals a day along with airconditioning and electricity saves money? How many families struggle to feed their families and keep the lights on, while criminals sit here in prisons for 30 years and have everything some families struggle for, for free, and thats fair?

If someone kwows the death penalty is strictly enforced, more than likely that person will think twice about committing the crime. Its common sense, if someone knows there are consequences, if a person understands that their life will be taken if they take someone else's life, less crimes will be committed. Now the death penalty is used more and more lightly and criminals know that more than likely nothing too terribly harmful will happen if they were to commit crimes.

Second, the death penalty becomes intolerable the very moment that someone is wrongly convicted. Death is, if anything, permanent.

death penalty,"I'm sorry for your loss Pro. There are three things that need to be considered when deciding whether or not to employ the death penalty. I shall discuss all three, in order from least important to most important. Financial Cost Simply put, it is not cost-efficient to use the death sentence over life without parole, which is the alternative to the death penalty and vice versa. It costs 1.25 million dollars more per death penalty case than the average life without parole case[1]. I can't think of anything else to say for this portion of my argument, as it is very straightforward. Morality The death penalty adheres to the idea of an eye for an eye. Many people who look at the death penalty see it at as a no-brainer, a simple solution, equal to the crime. And it is equal to the crime, which is what's wrong with the death penalty. If a punishment is considered equal to the crime, then how can it be considered any better than the crime itself? It can't be! Imagine if the punishment for a rapist was rape, or the murderer of a family--to have his family murdered. Most civilized people would say that's going too far. And yet they are able to turn around and make an exception for the death penalty. Bottom line is that the death penalty stoops down to the level of the murderer, and such a thing is immoral. Ability to Deter Many people have defended against the death penalty with the point that it deters crime. Before I entered this debate I did extensive research on the death penalty's ability to deter, and I have found overwhelming statistics and statements from professionals that show the death penalty as an ineffective method for deterring crime. Almost 90% of criminologists agree that the death penalty does not deter the crimes it punishes[2]. The main reason for this being that most homicides are committed without forethought--acting out of emotion, or under the influence of drugs or alcohol, preventing their ability to think about the consequences. Anybody who does think ahead about murdering somebody (like a professional hitman) will likely make preparations and plans to evade capture, and would not go ahead with their kill if they did not feel secure in their ability to evade capture. My opponent may bring up some statistical studies that support the idea that the death penalty does deter homicide, but as I said earlier, almost 90% of their colleagues would disagree. As for the why they disagree, I'll just quote an expert's opinion on that: Jeffrey A. Fagan, PhD, Professor of Law and Epidemiology at Columbia University, said in his Feb. 1, 2006 testimony ""Deterrence and the Death Penalty: Risk, Uncertainty, and Public Policy Choices"" published on the website of the US Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Property Rights: ""Recent studies claiming that executions reduce crime... fall apart under close scrutiny. These new studies are fraught with numerous technical and conceptual errors: inappropriate methods of statistical analysis, failures to consider all the relevant factors that drive crime rates, missing data on key variables in key states, the tyranny of a few outlier states and years, weak to non-existent tests of concurrent effects of incarceration, statistical confounding of murder rates with death sentences, failure to consider the general performance of the criminal justice system... and the absence of any direct test of deterrence. These studies fail to reach the demanding standards of social science to make such strong claims... Social scientists have failed to replicate several of these studies, and in some cases have produced contradictory results with the same data, suggesting that the original findings are unstable, unreliable and perhaps inaccurate. This evidence, together with some simple examples and contrasts... suggest that there is little evidence that the death penalty deters crime.""[2] So I conclude that the Death Penalty is not cost-effective, immoral, and has failed to satisfactorily prove that it is a deterrent to the crime it punishes.

At the trial level, death penalty cases are estimated to generate roughly $470,000 inadditional costs to the prosecution and defense over the cost of trying the same case as an aggravated murder without the death penalty and costs of $47,000 to $70,000 for court personnel.

Definition Death Penalty: death as punishment for a crime called also capital punishment http://dictionary.reference.com... Should: must; ought http://dictionary.reference.com... Illegal: Forbidden by law or statute http://dictionary.reference.com... Overview This debate will be about the death penalty. I shall be con saying that the death penalty should be illegal, for it is immoral. Pro will rebuttal and give statements on how the death penalty should be legal and that we should continue executing prisoners. The death penalty is rather pointless in my opinion because it costs us more money than the life sentence. The death penalty—does it bring back the victim? No it doesn’t. The death penalty rather than showing us to not perpetrate heinous crimes—shows that us Americans kill one another. Structure of the Debate Round 1: Introductions, and first arguments for Con. Pro will show his rebuttals to my arguments and give his own arguments Round 2: Con will argue back and give more reasons. Pro will rebuttal to Con’s claims and give his arguments again. Round 3: Same as round 2 Round 4: Rebuttal, and give your own personal reasons why the death penalty should be illegal or legal. (for both Pro and Con.) Round 5: Conclusion. Arguments The Death Penalty is a waste of money The death penalty is a pointless way to punish criminals in many ways. Rather than spend 137 million dollars a year on executing criminals, we should just put them into a life sentence. As said earlier—137 million dollars a year is on executing criminals, but however putting them in a life-sentence will cost only around 11.5 million dollars a year. Life sentence can just be as agonizing as having the death sentence. Death sentence basically means that they kill the criminals, but having a life sentence means that they let the criminals rot in jail until they die. http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org... The Death Penalty is considered cruel and unusual The United States constitution prevents Americans from being killed in a cruel and unusual manner. Whether or not it’s a decapitation, electric chair, gas chamber, or lethal injection—it’s barbaric to allow state-sanctioned murder in a crowd of people. There’s no point in watching one being killed in an audience, so to say. My belief is that it’s unusual for American’s to be watching an execution happening in jail. The Death Penalty could’ve killed innocent lives The third argument in which I will provide states that “The Death Penalty could’ve killed innocent lives.” For example—Donald Paradis was sentence to death row in the 1980s for the assumption of him killing two people. After 21 years of hard work from his lawyers—they proved that Donald Paradis actually did not kill the two people—rather he hid the bodies into another place. In this website in which I will provide—it states that they saved approximately 12 innocent people from death row.. 12 people that might’ve been killed for no exact reason—other than perjury from the jury. http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org...

death penalty,"Hello again, this debate is certainly very hot. I'm sorry to hear about your friends misfortune Mr Walters (no offence at the name intended btw, Walters is a nice name), its a shame the world is as messed up as it is. I understand the death penalty is a serious subject and will continue with caution. In my debate i say that the death penalty should be used in some cases, perhaps not in the case of the typical homicidal murderer but certainly for the worst crimes which evoke repulsion from even the most hardened. I think Furman (https://www.aclu.org......) took a good approach when a two tier method of trial was adopted, firstly to test innocence and secondly to assign a resolution. The decision made in this context should always be based on hard, factual evidence of substance to avoid harm to the innocent upstanding citizen. The sources you provided (https://www.aclu.org......) explain much of the criticism towards the death penalties usage. I contend however that not all of these seemingly evident points are valid. For instance, the death penalty is said to be costly, costing money for litigation and other court fee's. The cost minimized by not using the death penalty however is contradicted by the services needed to be commissioned by the state to prevent crime such as gun control and anti drug proliferation action by the police. For each case where the death penalty is not used to save state litigation fees an officer must be paid to protect their country. Also, the police say that alternatives to the death penalty are more effective but this works in their own favour. By opposing the death penalty the police are opposing the removal of crime committing individuals and creating more work for themselves. This is corrupt, similar to how the mental health services label a patient to ensure they are forced to seek treatment. To continue, you make the point, it is mentioned your sources too, that some families would prefer not to use the death penalty. Sources also state that legal professionals often are swayed in favour of pro death penalty cases. Much of your argument has stated that we should obey the law ourselves and not commit murder, comparing the death penalty to murder. The law however is made in different ways through democracy, centralized planning and some would say there is no strict law, free market economists for example. Through liberal means each individual is given law making capacity, It is seen as moral that each person decides their own law. The opinions of pro death penalty legal professions are then important in a liberal system, as much as the public's. The penalty for murder, in its simplest form, is already decided by the guilty individual too. If a person chooses to kill another person they see this as legally, socially and spiritually correct. That is then that individuals law and liberty must respect it.

death penalty,"My opponent has failed to make any efficent argument. If he forfeits round three, he will lose. All I have to do is paste one argument against the death penalty, and I'll win. The following text is from another argument of mine, one I did a few weeks ago. ==C1: The Cost== The cost of the death penalty is no secret. In California alone, people spend $308 million on each execution, which totals up to about $4 billion over time for only 13 executions. In modern times, it costs about 177 million dollars more yearly to have the death penalty over LWOP in California. There are 733 people in California on death row. If we were to actually execute them all, it would cost us a little over $240 billion dollars. In contrast, that's more than 1/3 of the U.S military budget. If the death penalty was abolished in California, we would be able to spend the extra money on things that further deter murder, such as the police force, security, or even education. It seems inevitable that LWOP deters murders, and we could further add to that amount with the extra funds we would have. In other states, the death penalty is not widely used (take Maryland, which only has 5 inmates on death row). 5 executions over time costed a staggering $186 million. They took actions to then abolish the death penalty to save these costs. To sum up, it would be much cheaper to simply use LWOP instead of the death penalty. With the funds we save, we could focus on improving police force, education, benefits, etc. ==C2: Deterrent== The death penalty is not as much of a deterrent as it is advertised to be. A poll of experts revealed scary results. 88% believe it is not a deterrent [6], while 5% believe it is, and 7% have no opinion. If we need further proof that the death penalty does not deter murder or deters as less as LWOP, we can look at the state evidence. The states that use the death penalty the most have a range of 5.1-12.5 murders per 100,000, while states with LWOP have a range of 1.2-7.1 murders per 100,000, significantly lower than states with the death penalty. Thus, it seems that murderers are more scared of LWOP than the death penalty. Furthermore, most deterrence studies are very unreliable, as an analysis of data showed that a minor tweaking of instruments used to record data can show results from the death penalty deters 429 murders to that the death penalty makes 86 murders happen. The evidence that LWOP deters more murders than LWOP does not stop at the U.S.A. All around the globe, there is solid evidence that the death penalty does not deter as much murder as LWOP. Take a look at the quote below: “The five countries in the world with the highest homicide rates that do not impose the death penalty have nearly half the number of murders per 100 000 people than the five countries with the highest homicides rates which do impose the death penalty (United Nations Development program)” There is no clear evidence that the death penalty deters more murders (or any) than LWOP. The only evidence is quotes, which really are not evidence at all. There is no refuting hard data that shows LWOP is a better deterrent than LWOP. ==C3: Innocence== It is irrefutable that once you put a man to death, there is a 0% chance he will live. It is also irrefutable that if you put an innocent man to death, there would be a 0% chance of that man being able to live the life he deserved. This both has happened and has come very close to happening. Take Jason O'dell for example. At the time he was put to death, there were serious questions regarding his guiltiness.Then he was put to death, and the DNA tests were burned up afterwards. This was obviously because the U.S did not want to face an innocent execution, even though they did one. Furthermore, 144 people have been released from death row. This suggests that up to 3.5% of people on the death row are, and was, innocent. If we were to abolish the death penalty, there would be a 0% chance that an innocent man would ever get executed again.",CON,"My opponent has failed to make any efficent argument.

Again, I could go into the devastational effects on the families of the victims, which harms many more people than it would the family of a serial killer, but you would argue I would be creating more pain by killing the killer. I cannot understand why a family would continue to support said killer, however it may happen. You have discounted economics and all other sensible retort I may have had, so it would be pointless me highlighting the economic benefits of the death penalty. You may personally be opposed to the death penalty, but, as is apparent in the Unite States, the people evidently want the death penalty, else they would proposition the banishment in their own state.

The above is only one example of a poll, and there are more to be found should you require . I concede that the Government has too many powers as it stands, however if they are to maintain any degree of PERCEPTION of justice, it would be a wise move to include the death penalty. Regardless of its effectiveness, it still puts the public mind at ease. All too commonly, we read comments in newspapers referencing the death penalty and the revival of it. To put my position bluntly, I will use an example. If most of the penitentiaries in the United States followed the model of Sheriff Joe Arpaio, with his demeaning treatment prisoners through making them wear pink underwear and handcuffs, feeding them on pittance per day, and letting them sizzle in 100 degree heat in the desert of Arizona, I would be opposed to the death penalty. However, this is NOT the case, most especially here in Britain. Some prisons are palatial. If the ""Arpaio model"" was adopted, I would deem that apt and just punishment, considering their life would be in more misery than if they were dead. That is certainly punishment in the true sense of the word. For as long as Britain continues to send prisoners to tax-funded 5* hotels, I deem the death penalty a worthy inclusion to the system.",PRO,"If most of the penitentiaries in the United States followed the model of Sheriff Joe Arpaio, with his demeaning treatment prisoners through making them wear pink underwear and handcuffs, feeding them on pittance per day, and",338

How could this man possibly just go to prison. He took innocent lives so why shouldn't a fair punishment for him be the death penalty. An eye for eye, right? I do realize many arguments against the death penalty are that what if an innocent was sentenced with a death penalty. While this is possible it is very rare. An innocent man has a better chance of being killed by a falling meteor. The death penalty offers more reward than risk. Also another thought is when someone doesn't get the death penalty there is a decent chance he will be out on the streets before he dies. Very few people serve a full life penalty.

Furthermore, most deterrence studies are very unreliable, as an analysis of data showed that a minor tweaking of instruments used to record data can show results from the death penalty deters 429 murders to that the death penalty makes 86 murders happen [8]. The evidence that LWOP deters more murders than LWOP does not stop at the U.S.A. All around the globe, there is solid evidence that the death penalty does not deter as much murder as LWOP. Take a look at the quote below: “The five countries in the world with the highest homicide rates that do not impose the death penalty have nearly half the number of murders per 100 000 people than the five countries with the highest homicides rates which do impose the death penalty (United Nations Development program) [9]” There is no clear evidence that the death penalty deters more murders (or any) than LWOP.

If we were to abolish the death penalty, there would be a 0% chance that an innocent man would ever get executed again. I will now go on to refuting my opponent's arguments. ==Rc1: Hemorabi got it right!== My opponent states a quote from about 3,000 years ago as evidence. He states that since it worked in ANCIENT MESOPITAMIA, THE CRADLE OF CIVILIZATION, it would work today. First off, times have changed and old quotes have gotten questioned. My opponent has no credible, modern evidence that Hemorabi got it right. One way it wouldn't work today is that ""you kill my family member, I kill you."" The only murder that is even justifiable is when you kill out of self defense, which is clearly not the case. I have shown that people are less scared of the chair than of LWOP, so this makes your argument false. If we ban the death penalty, we would still have LWOP, and no more murders would be committed than when we have the death penalty. My opponent has no evidence for his bold claim that ""prisoners think they would rule it or escape."" If they really though that, so many crimes would be committed because each person wants a chance to escape and rule prison. In conclusion, a quote from a dead man of a civilization 3,000 years ago with no evidence is just not credible. Until my opponent shows further evidence, this argument is completely false. ==Rc2: More execution[s] made murder [rates] drop!== This argument is really just an example of my opponent not looking far down into the data. While murder rates have dropped in states with the death penalty, they have also dropped in states without the death penalty. This suggests that the police force is to credit for this drop in murder, not the death penalty. What my opponent's graphs failed to show in the murder relation between states with the death penalty and states without the death penalty. They only show the U.S.A as a whole, assuming that the whole entire U.S.A has the death penalty (which we don't.) Thus, your graphs are biased and not solid evidence. What Ernest Van Deg Haag said may be flawed. The death penalty statistics show that LWOP is more feared. If people feared death the most, why do people do very stupid things? Why do people commit suicide? Why do people volunteer to be in the military? His logic is flawed when he said we must continue to execute murderers if it protects society. He fails to see that LWOP deters murders also. I will have to end my arguments and rebuttals here. I eagerly await my opponent's response! Thank you! [1] http://articles.latimes.com...

death penalty,"RESOLUTION: The Death Penalty should not be abolished The death penalty has always been a controversial debate topic. In this increasingly changing world, we must decide upon a dillema, to change or to keep. Before I start with my points, I would like to define several points in the resolution: The Death Penalty: a legal process whereby a person is put to death by the state as a punishment for a crime. Abolished: To get rid of The law has been an important part of human society and humanity itself; law has preserved humanity and it's existence from the barbaric actions of our fellow human brothers. From the ruins of Athens, where law has been the ""masters and preservers of humanity""; there was a story revolving Athens. A Persian Master once said to an Athenian exile ""how many men do I need to defeat Athens? Surely 40,000 would be enough"". The Athenian exile, an ex-politician himself, soon replied with easy words; ""You cannot. They fear the law too much; perhaps they fear that more than your servants fear you."" One cannot stress the importance of law in human society. But why is the death penalty such an important part of law? Why can we not dodge the death penalty for other alternatives, other than death? 1. The Death Penalty Saves Lives and preserve Law and Order Exhibit One: Singapore That small city state that broke the barrier of the third world into the first world in three decade has been under the strong and iron-willed leadership of the Right-Winged People's Action Party, has been introducing strict laws and enforcing them for the last 3 decades. Singapore has the world's second highest execution per capita, but yet Singapore has one of the lowest crime rates in the world. Petty offences, such as pickpocketting, are not very common, but is one of Singapore's most common crime. Violent crime is rare although it does happen once in a blue moon. This is because of strict (very strict indeed) laws regarding the death penalty; for example, carrying 1,200 grams of opium can get you executed in Singapore, whereas a jail sentence would probably be given out if a situation like this was to happen in a different country. We can clearly see that the death penalty has had a positive effect on Singapore's crime rate. Exhibit Two: Texas This huge state (twice the size of the sovereign nation of Thailand) who is known for it's cowboys and rancheros has the second highest execution rates, with 1,466 people having been executed in Texas; perhaps unsurprisingly, Texas has a very low crime rate; with 2 murders and 3 arsons per 100,000 citizens. Although laws here are less strict than that of Singapore, they are still moderately strict, with murder for renumation (aka contract killing) and murder of a person less than ten years of age could get you the death penalty. Texas therefore has a low number of murders; this is clear proof that the death penalty saves lives and preserves law and order of the thousands of innocent civilians that live among murderers. 2. The Abolishing of the Death Penalty increases more crime Norway fits perfectly in this category; in 1979, the death penalty was abolished. Crime statistics in Norway, then, were already low. However, reports starting from the year 2000 shows that crime statistics in Norway has been increasing; in 2008, Norway reported 34 murders country wide. Although this puts Norway's murder rates at 0.69 per 100,000 citizens (relatively low), other crimes have been increasing. Sex offending crimes, like rape, have been on the increase in Norway (and Sweden), to the point that a German tourist guidebook has declared the city ""the crime center of Scandinavia"" and Oslo has been declared ""unsafe for lone female tourists"". On a much more related note, the White Supremacist Anders Breivik, who is now serving an indefinite term for killing 77 youth labor party enthuiasts, is now receiving first-class treatment for a crime in which he DEFINITELY deserved a death sentence. As we can see, the abolishing of the death penalty results an increase in crime. 3. The Death penalty carries ultimate justice A man cannot be put to death unless he has been rightfully accused by law, and there is no evidence to contradict the action (which violated the law) in which he committed. The death penalty carries ultimate justice, as all fate of men lie in law. We humans were brought up to be law loving, and to love the law. Therefore, to abolish it would let the criminals run wild. As seen in my two previous cases, the death penalty has the ability to provide a positive effect on law and enforcement. This is a fact in which we cannot deny. The argument that all life is sacred does not overrule the argument for the better of society. In order for our future to be as propserous as our past, we must not abolish the measures that has preserved law and order for the last 2,000 years. CONCLUSION: The death penalty should not be abolished. It is because the death penalty decreases murder, and abolishing it increase crime rate, and that all men's fate lie in law, is why we should not abolish the death penalty. I wish the opponent the best of luck in her next argument.

He made a judicial system that went like this. You steal from me, I steal from you. You killed my family member, I kill you. The system worked to repel crime in Mesopotamia. It would be the opposite if we would ban the death penalty. People would not be afraid of the chair, and would commit more murders! They would think when they go to prison that they would rule it or escape! Case 2: More Execution Made Murder Drop! Puzzled by this discovery? You really shouldn't. It has been proven with sources such as The Bureau Of Criminal justice that more executions made murder take a substantial drop. As you see from this graph, as execution was at an all time low, murder was at an all time high. Here is another graph showing the correlation of murders and death penalties. The ultimately lower as the death penalty gets higher! A quote from Ernest Van Deg Haag ""Common sense, lately bolstered by statistics, tells us that the death penalty will deter murder... People fear nothing more than death. Therefore, nothing will deter a criminal more than the fear of death... life in prison is less feared. Murderers clearly prefer it to execution -- otherwise, they would not try to be sentenced to life in prison instead of death... Therefore, a life sentence must be less deterrent than a death sentence. And we must execute murderers as long as it is merely possible that their execution protects citizens from future murder."" Ernest Van Deg Haag Late Professor of Jurisprudence at Fordham University ""For the Death Penalty,"" New York Times Case 3: The Death Penalty Is Moral!

But communities would plunge into anarchy if they could not act on moral assumptions less certain than that the sun will rise in the east and set in the west. Abolitionists may contend that the death penalty is inherently immoral because governments should never take human life, no matter what the provocation. But that is an article of faith, not of fact. The death penalty honors human dignity by treating the defendant as a free moral actor able to control his own destiny for good or for ill; it does not treat him as an animal with no moral sense.""

death penalty,"First I have to say sorry to my opponent for one missing the second round resulting in a forfeit. Second, for the lack of my free time I cannot give this argument my full effort, but will still try to convince the viewers of my position. 1) I agree that life imprisonment could easily be interpreted as cruel and unusual, however, with the death penalty, society focuses on vengeance and punishment, but with life imprisonment we can focus on rehabilitation and forgiveness. The death penalty gives the accused no chance of turning their life around, and is often sought out of vengeance of families of the victims, however the death penalty brings little to no closure of the families. These botched executions are unacceptable and because there is no humane method of killing, none shall be used. 2) As I have shown, the death penalty is at least as expensive and more often way more expensive than life imprisonment. My opponent argues that trials shall be done faster and more efficiently, however that will just result in more mistakes, cause after all, we are all human, we all make mistakes, not just criminals. 3) I accept my opponent's argument that use of the death penalty doesn't correlate with murder rates, however I still state that the death penalty is not an effective deterrent. My opponent claims that more use of the death penalty would result in better deterrence, I admit this is possible, but it would not be a good thing for society, which is the original argument. An excessive use of the death penalty creates fear in society, which would be one method of deterrence, however with life imprisonment and the injection of morals into society. That way, society as a whole could get a better grasp on what is right and wrong. 4) Ok, all I have is one question: How many innocent people can be executed before the death penalty should stop being used? 5) The video doesn't relate to any one point, I feel that it helps express my overall feeling of the topic. http://www.youtube.com...",CON,"2) As I have shown, the death penalty is at least as expensive and more often way more expensive than life imprisonment. ... http://www.youtube.com...",343
death penalty,"This is a debate concerning the death penalty and as the side arguing against it, I would like to make the following points: 1. The death penalty is costly When I say costly, I mean that according to NBC it costs about 1.7 million dollars to execute someone. New Jersey got rid of the death penalty because it costed 4 million dollars per inmate and they hadn't executed anyone since 1963. Plus, inmates staring into the face of the death penalty are entitled to two lawyers which could cost hundreds of thousands of dollars alone. 2. What if they're innocent The fact that the risk of ending the life of an innocent person should not be permitted, Killing an innocent person is morally reprehensible, so why should our justice system allow that possibility to exist? By eliminating the death penalty we eliminate any chance of this happening. 3. Does the death penalty deter crime ""There's no credible evidence of deterrence,"" concludes John Blume, a law professor with the Cornell Death Penalty Project. (Excerpt from the Denver Post). There's no way to tell if a murderer was aware of a state's death-penalty status when the crime was deliberated, or what impact the knowledge had. (also from the same article).

death penalty,"There are many ""crimes"" for which death penalty is applied that are not really high. For example, a woman was killed with death penalty in the United States just because she was alone in a mall. Do you think that just because this is prohibided it is a crime? No, it just a violation of laws in the country that she can correct with some time in the jail. With the death penalty many ""crimes"" like this are beeing punished. A discovery channel investigation shows that countries that alredy abolish death penalty have less criminals, because they have not any scare feelings about it. But some people are afraid of the jail and take out the idea of beeing criminals. How is death penalty not going to be the easy way if you think that the way of having less criminals is take them out of the world? The best way to stop it is to make them change and say sorry and if you try that, even if you don't achieve it, that will not be the easy way. Death penalty is a revenge. Let's suppose that a person violates someone and the victim kills him. Yu will clearly say that it is revenge, but if the government do the same, you will say that not. Human rights are equal for EVERYONE, even if the government is superior, they have to respect human rights of everyone, can not decide what to do with the life of people and can't take revenge replacing another person just because they are superior. If death penalty really helps, why does the countries that alredy abolish it have less criminals? Take the example of Donald Calloway. He was a criminal since he was 15 years old. he scaped from the jail. In a moment when he transformed to catholic religion, he say sorry to God and cry for his criminal acts.

So, if you are against this argument, you are basically costing the ordinary joe more money to keep killers and and cold-blooded murderers alive. People are paying for criminals' food and water.

death penalty,"For this round, I will take a quote stated by my opponent and argue of why it is necessary for the Death Penalty. ""With the death penalty there are several reasons for why i am against it. One i am STRONGLY AGAINST IT is because it is killing a human being which is not acceptable in my book"" First off, I like to point out that my opponent is clearly using his opinion without evidence. He is going based on assumptions, without proof to support his argument. My opponent states that it is wrong to kill a human being, and will agree it is wrong if the person is innocent; however, most people put to death by the death penalty are criminals. Stated from ""Death Penalty Information Center"" (1) the number of those executed was mostly because of murder and rape following behind. The most methods used was a lethal injection, and that was it. Why should we keep a murderer or rapist alive, when they commited a felony that placed traumatic stress upon a victim; or his or her family? When we could just simply execute them, instead of always trying to keep them alive. ""Another topic is america is wondering why our economy is in so much debt is because we spend a lot of money on the death penalty system"". Again, my opponent makes a strong claim about our debt being because of the Death Penalty but does not offer any evidence. And I do agree with my opponent that we should save money, but getting rid of the Death Penalty isn't the answer. The answer is eliminating Death Row. Voters, Death Row is simply the inmates who wait in a certain cell until their execution take place. After the criminal is sentenced to Death Penalty, instead of a more instantaneous death; it is a long drawn process of trying to prove that the criminal isn't guilt even though most of the time, they are. In fact, stated under ""1 in 25 given the Death Penalty are Innocent"" it states that it is a very small percentage of the individual being innocent (2). With the tweaking of Death Row, by making it more instant, we will actually save money from paying taxes to waiting inmates about to come into death (3). ""Another reason as cited below is ""There is a better way to help the families of murder victims."" with this quote it is very true there are many other different ways to deal with families of murder victims such as a whole bunch of grief counseling why should a guy or woman DIE because of the crime"". Is there a better way? Yes, there is which is the Death Penalty. My opponent, we must take the fact of accountability within this debate because we must ask the question ""Who decides to commit the crime in the first place""? The criminal should suffer the consequences because he or she decided to do the crime in the first place. For the families, I admit it can be traumatic for losing a loved on but more justice is achieved with the death penalty. Stated from ""Capital Punishment is Morally Justified"" (4), it states: ""Despite arguments to the contrary, the death penalty is a morally acceptable punishment for muder. In fact, it is morally wrong not to execute a murderer because punishment must fit the crime. Simply putting someone in jail does not compare to taking someone's life. As to the reasons most often given for abolishing the death penalty—such as the death penalty does not deter crime or the death penalty is unconstitutional—they are easily and rationally refuted. The purpose of the death penalty is to bring the murderer to justice and to acknowledge the sanctity and dignity of innocent human life"". ""Murder is defined as basically killing a human being and how on earth is the death penalty sentence not MURDER? and why should innocent people die"". Once more, individuals accountability for their actions. Why defend them when they most of time time take the life of an innocent bistander. Voters, what would you like to achieve if you were killed in cold blood? Killing the person who cost you your life, or let them have the easy way out? ""With ending this argument mentally ill people are also killed using this death penalty no matter what their crime was who knows they DID NOT KNOW WHAT THEY WERE DOING"". I go with the idea that if the individual is potential harm to society, they should be executed for the protection of others. Whats the main goal in society? To watch for each others backs, and not a criminal who decided their faith after murdering or causing trauma to the victim.

death penalty,"Argument 1: Costs - Response to Counter The first part of my opponent's argument is that costs are offset by plea bargains. Unfortunately, the source link he provided came up with a ""404 - file not found"" message for me, so I am unable to respond; if you are a random reader, please comment if the link works for you. Nonetheless, he has no evidence for his claim that there are more plea bargains because of the death penalty. I have arguments that suggest that plea bargaining does not help reduce costs. Source [1] provides an example where the reinstatement of the death penalty did not provide an increase of plea bargains. Three of the top five states with the highest rates of prisoners serving life without parole are non-death penalty states; prosecutors in New Jersey have admitted that the abolition of the death penalty in 2007 has made no difference in their ability to secure guilty pleas; in Alaska, plea bargaining was abolished completely in 1975, and a 1980 study by the National Institute of Justice found that since the end of plea bargaining, ""guilty pleas continued to flow in at nearly undiminished rates. Most defendants pled guilty even when the state offered them nothing in exchange for their cooperation."" [2] Furthermore, according to Northwestern University Economics Professor Jeff Ely, ""The threat of the death penalty makes defendants more willing to accept a given plea bargain offer. But a tough-on-crime DA takes up the slack by making tougher offers. What is the net effect…the threat of the death penalty results in fewer plea bargains and more cases going to trial"" [3]. In addition to this, with the death penalty in effect, many defendants may accept plea bargains out of fear of the death penalty, whether they are guilty or not. They might be afraid that they do not have competent legal representation, and since there is enough evidence for them to be accused, they may believe they will be sentenced because of their legal representation is not competent enough to defend them properly. In this way, using death penalty as a threat to secure plea bargains forces many defendants to give up their right to a fair trial [4]. ""I can say that if the death penalty has a deterrent effect, it is deterring something valuable enough for the extra cost. That is to say, if the death penalty saves lives, then the cost is justified."" Not necessarily. The money could be better used in other areas of law enforcement that could save more lives by using the money more effectively. Argument 2: Deterrence - Response to Counter ""I would like everyone to be aware of the insanity plea, in which a defendant can argue insanity to get out of a capitol punishment, so in that effect this argument is invalid."" I was not addressing costs when brought up mental illnesses, but rather deterrence; you have provided no evidence that the death penalty deters people with mental illness, which is generally involved in extreme acts of crime, from committing these acts. You have simply provided a way from them of getting out of the death penalty, which would make the death penalty even less of a deterrence. ""from the American Law & Econ Review in 2003[2] ""Our results show that capitol punishment has a strong deterrent effect; each execution results, on average, in eighteen fewer murders. Tests show that results not driven by tougher sentencing laws and are robust to other alternative specifications."" This quote clearly says 1 execution prevents 18 murders...Now, I said that if the death penalty saves lives, then cost is justified."" ""The Texas Tech University Law Review did a more conclusive study on moratoriums on the death penalty that occurred in Texas and Illinois in 2008...371 murders that could of, and should of been stopped, but were not."" I have provided a plethora of sources that cases involving the death penalty cost more than the cases without the death penalty. You have not refuted the sources' data. Now, the money spent on death penalty cases could go to more effective ways of reducing murder, such as providing the police with more funds. One advantage of proving more funds to the police is that they are more able to stop all sorts of crimes. The Death Penalty may, if the sources that are not linked are correct, prevent more extreme ones, but the police can help stop both murder and driving under the influence, for example. For Pro's source 3, unless Pro can provide better data, I do not see how the 371 murders, that could have been stopped, were not stopped simply because the death penalty was not present. He mentioned how the murders could have been prevented, but by what? ""My response is that the population of Iowa is much lower than the population of Minnesota, by about 2 million people, and that this is why murder rate is low -- not because of the death penalty. Plus, my opponent never linked Iowa's low crime rates to an absence of the death penalty, nor did he link Minnesota's high crime rates to the presence of the death penalty. So this argument was vague and incorrect."" I was trying to convey that location had little to do with it; the death penalty is more common in the Southern region of the United States, so one may argue that the South simply has higher crime rates. The example I provided, and my source had three more, showed that this was not necessarily true. Two states bordering one another still had different crime rates, with the trend continuing where death penalty states had higher ones. Argument 3: Innocence - Response to Counter ""1. Time...the average time between the arrest of a death row inmate and the execution of one, is 28 years...This is plenty of time to come to a watertight conclusion,"" Once again, humans are fallible, so error is possible. A lot of time is taken, but error is certainly possible. There is no denying it. ""2. No proof. The other response is that there has never any conclusive proof that any of the inmates executed in modern times were innocent[4]. Think about it -- In a thirty year period no has had an absolute exoneration. There are only two reasons this would be so. 1. Widespread evidence tampering, or 2. Death Penalty convictions are correct. I plan to talk about this more in my rebuttals as so my opponent can expound upon this a little more."" I will restate what I said earlier: ""Most courts generally do not entertain the possibility that they executed an innocent person, while defense attorneys focus their attention on clients' who can be saved."" Furthermore, I have already said that under the threat of the death penalty, people may accept plea charges and plead guilty, whether guilty or not. The death penalty still causes innocent people to be detained. Disadvantage 1: Prison Chaos - Counter ""You come to two terrifying scenarios. Either 1: The criminal spends his life planning and scheming so as to escape"" As opposed to someone on death row? Escape is something that all sorts of prisoners may attempt, not just those who receive a life sentence. Either way, prison escapes are on the decline, despite the rising amount of criminals in jail [5]. ""2: The criminal kills other inmates and guards, because he has nothing else to be threatened with."" He has little evidence to show how common this actually happens, and once again, this is a problem for all prisoners, not just those with life sentences. People with life sentences may think they have less to lose, but so may people on death row. Disadvantage 2: Lost of Plea Bargaining - Counter I have refuted his argument in my response to counter 1.

death penalty,"The death penalty is not just in place to serve justice or give closure; the death penalty is also used to keep people safe from the murderers. This is best represented in this quote, by Michael Kronenwetter, ""According to the death penalty's proponents, at the most basic level, the execution of dangerous criminals can be seen as a simple matter of self-defense, because, at the very least, death stops executed criminals from ever repeating their crimes."" The death penalty is a way of making the world a safer place and it is arguably a self-defense claim. People who have committed a murder do scare others in society, the thought that this murderer could be able to kill again is a great reason to sentence them to death. Kronenwetter, Michael.

death penalty,"I suppose that I will go straight into argument since I have accepted this debate. The reasons that I support the death penalty are as follows: 1. The threat of the death penalty decreases crime rates. 2. The criminals knew what the consequences of their actions would be and yet they still committed the crime. They chose to accept that consequence when they chose to commit the crime. If the government does not administer those consequences, then the result would be a higher number of crimes that are punishable by death. 3. My religious reason for supporting the death penalty is this: The Lord told Nephi in the Book of Mormon to kill Laban because it was better for one wicked man to die than for an entire nation to dwindle in unbelief. I compare this to how the death penalty, or the death of one wicked man, keeps this nation from finding murder, rape, and other crimes punishable by death morally acceptable.",PRO,"If the government does not administer those consequences, then the result would be a higher number of crimes that are punishable by death. ...

death penalty,"Rebuttal 1: Let me give you an example. You tell me if this person deserves to live. This is a real man. Not a scenario. Does he deserve to live? Look at is face. Does he show any remorse? Do you really want filth like that alive? I don't. If people don't care about the death penalty, then why do they always ask for life in prison instead of death? It is illogical to let scum like that live. Garbage gets burned in the incinerator, and most of the time, dogs get put down for biting someone. Rebuttal 2: Count the new offenders that don't need to fear the death penalty anymore and we'll see what happens.... You also forget my arguments about cutting costs. Rebuttal 3: It hasn't been put to effect yet because all of this controversy with the death penalty! You can cut trails by having less court time, more evidence required to convict them, and making jury deliberations a little bit shorter. Rebuttal 4: Experts are not criminals and have no way of knowing what a killer is thinking when on trail. They could be saying that now, but let's see if they would say it if they would be faced with death. I showed the graph to rebuttal it. You see the crime rates that aren't murder, then compare it to Texas, you see there is a big difference. Most of the non-death penalty states are small states. It's easier to commit murder with a gun than a knife. That is why guns come into effect. Minnesota has less general crime as my opponent again fails to comprehend. it matters how much crime, not just murders, but general crime is in the area. I have shown that Minnesota has less general crime than Texas, so that shows they can't be compared. Again, my opponent fails to understand the different cultures in the area. Rebuttal 5: Murder has changed, but if there is solid DNA evidence (I know DNA evidence was non-existent back then) Then the hemorabi system should be taken into account. Rebuttal 6: You fail to understand my arguments once again. States with the death penalty are often larger, and have a bigger population. A big chunk of that is states with the death penalty. This overall last paragraph made no sense to me. I think the whole argument is in-valid. I think I have proved my point that the death penalty: The death penalty deters murders more than LWOP The death penalty is not morally justified The death penalty is cost-efficient I also suggest my opponent has not filled his BOP that: LWOP works better than the death penalty The death penalty is not morally justified The death penalty can never be cost efficient.

death penalty,"It provides retribution at a cost of an additional $90,000 per inmate on death row. Life imprisonment is less costly, and an equally valid form of retribution."" Life imprisonment is less costly? According to New York Times, New York City's Correction Department spent about $56,000 per inmate in 2003. Now lets assume that somebody(living in New York) is convicted of murder but instead of being put to death they are jailed for the rest of their life. Now lets take the Average age of a serial killer which is about 28 years of age without the death penalty they will spend the rest of their days in prison lets assume they live till they are 78 years old which is the life expectancy rate of a American born in 2005. Lets multiply it now, $56,000 multiply that by 50 years what's the answer? $2,800,000 That is quite a lot of money wouldn't you say? Now lets compare that to 20 years in prison on death row. $56,000 multiply that by 20 you get 1,120,000 now lets add to that number, the cost of lethal injection according to my opponent is $90,000 add that into my number above and it becomes $1,210,000. That is less then half the amount of money it costs to put someone to death. Imagine how much more money this country would save if we put our murderers to death the moment they are convicted of the crime. http://www.nytimes.com... ""The death penalty does not deter."" Says you? I am pretty sure that is a matter of opinion. The death penalty is more then enough deterrent to keep me from murdering somebody. ""If incapacitation alone could justify the death penalty, then it would be proper to extend it to every instance of every criminal act ever conducted. After all, the argument goes, they wouldn't reoffend."" The death penalty would in fact prevent more people from being murdered. In the end you are saving more lives then you are killing. You cannot compare the unlawful taking of a human life to any other crime. ""If the death penalty does educate the public, it doesn't do it in the way it aims to.By increasing the incidence of homicide, the death penalty clearly could not accomplish its ends under this criterion."" The overall murder rate jump doesn't prove that the death penalty doesn't work the way its supposed too, that is do to a multiple of different factors including the moral decline of the U.S. The state of North Carolina banned the death penalty in 2001. North Carolina had seen a pretty subtle decline in the murder rate for many years leading up to 2001 after it was decided to ban execution in the state, North Carolina has seen a subtle increase in murder rates in more recent years. http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org...

death penalty,"First, the death penalty is very expensive. In fact, more expensive than keeping the criminal in prison for life. In 2011, it was found that California spent a whopping $4 billion on capital punishment. This money could have been used to help the families of the victims instead of killing the offender. The death penalty goes against many religions who regard it as immoral. A study has shown that death penalty plays virtually no role in deterring criminals. Finally, one of the most obvious points, innocent people have been wrongly executed. This is a mistake that you cannot fix and is a terrible occurrence. If the death penalty was not in place, this would give investigators the time necessary to realize and declare the person innocent instead of just killing them. http://www.deathpenalty.org...

death penalty,"I do not see the death penalty as revenge by the government. If it is certain people will get the death penalty for a certain crime, I believe it will be less likely for people to commit the crime in the first place. People who commit crimes such as rape, torture, treason, kidnapping, murder, larceny, and perjury already show they have no moral instincts because they would not commit these crimes otherwise. If we were to install the death penalty this ensures this crimes will not be repeated by the same offender. The death penalty should be used in extreme cases. Take for example John Wayne Gacy. A serial killer and rapist of who convicted of 33 deaths of teenage boys and young men, but only charged with 12 of them in Illinois and given the death penalty.

death penalty,"Firstly I will defend your arguments ""How could this man possibly just go to prison."" Very easily, he could be given a life sentence and you would never see him again.

Because death penalty is costly [1] and the person who they find to be the murderer may be the wrong person [2] ""An eye for eye, right?"" Wrong. Many well respected people (ahem Gandhi) didn't believe this to be true ""I do realize many arguments against the death penalty are that what if an innocent was sentenced with a death penalty.

Actually, the chances of being falsely accused of the death penalty are 0.897226753670473% (although this is only based on cases that we suspect, there is undouptably countless other cases that we haven't suspected) and the chances of being killed by meteor are 0.00039999999999999996% so the chance of being killed by accidentally accusation is much higher.[3] ""The death penalty offers more reward than risk.""

death penalty,"What a shame. I really hoped you would give more points. However I still have to refute your points. ""The Deterrent Effect"" Like I previously wrote the Death Penalty does NOT deter crime. ""One argument for the death penalty is that it is a strong deterrent to murder and other violent crimes. In fact, evidence shows just the opposite. The homicide rate is at least five times greater in the United States than in any Western European country, all without the death penalty. Southern states carry out more than 80 percent of the executions but have a higher murder rate than any other region. Texas has by far the most executions, but its homicide rate is twice that of Wisconsin, the first state to abolish the death penalty. Look at similar adjacent states: There are more capital crimes in South Dakota, Connecticut and Virginia (with death sentences) than neighboring North Dakota, Massachusetts and West Virginia (without death penalties). Furthermore, there has never been any evidence that the death penalty reduces capital crimes or that crimes increased when executions stopped..."" Just because something is supposed to deter another thing it won't always work, like an untested vaccine. Here in Canada we have no death penalty and and almost no crime. ""Repeated Murders"" I get what you are saying but if someone has committed a crime so bad that they get the death penalty chances are they won't be released. Also there is a huge risk of innocence. ""The wrongful execution of an innocent person is an injustice that can never be rectified. Since the reinstatement of the death penalty, 142 men and women have been released from Death Row nationally....some only minutes away from execution. Moreover, in the past two years evidence has come to light which indicates that four men may have been wrongfully EXECUTED in recent years for crimes they did not commit. This error rate is simply appalling, and completely unacceptable, when we are talking about life and death."" Think of it this way. You are weighing the possibility of a criminal being released and POSSIBLY killing someone to the certainty of the state executing it's own citizen who might be innocent. ""Safety is Utmost"" Ah, you missed one thing. The state executes it's citizens in the name of public safety but this opens up a Pandora's box of governmental abuses, like the NSA. This is all in the name of public safety but are you getting a chain reaction of problems. You are destroying personal liberty and freedom just like Hitler or Stalin. They claimed what they did was for public safety but they took away their peoples rights just for their safety. The death penalty can, has and will mold people into Hitlers and Stalins.

death penalty,"First, I would like to say good luck to my opponent. To begin, I want to stress the fact that the death penalty is morally wrong. Why does the government say killing is wrong but goes ahead and does it anyway? We are taught that killing is wrong, and it should extend here too. from www.odap.org: There is a better alternative: life without parole. In Oregon, we have the option of sentencing convicted murderers to life in prison without the possibility of parole. There are currently over 121 people in Oregon who have received this sentence. The death penalty puts innocent lives at risk. Since the reinstatement of the death penalty in the United States in 1976, 138 innocent men and women have been released from death row, including some who came within minutes of execution. In Missouri, Texas and Virginia investigations have been opened to determine if those states executed innocent men. To execute an innocent person is morally reprehensible; this is a risk we cannot take. Race and place determine who lives and who dies. Those who kill whites are more likely to be sentenced to die than those who kill African-Americans. In Oregon, prosecutors from some counties are more likely to pursue the death penalty than others are. We pay many millions for the death penalty system. According to the Oregonian, in 1995 the trials for three Washington County murder cases cost more than $1.5 million. One was sentenced to death. The two others, one of whom was found guilty of four murders, are not on death row. In 2000 a fiscal impact summary from the Oregon Department of Administrative Services stated that the Oregon Judicial Department alone would save $2.3 million annually if the death penalty were eliminated. It is estimated that total prosecution and defense costs to the state and counties equal $9 million per year. This shows at least four reasons why the death penalty is wrong. We pay more, we get nothing out of it, and there are essentially no consequences (other than death) for the perpetrator.",CON,"First, I would like to say good luck to my opponent.  ...

death penalty,"To explain the idiotic forfeit, my mom stole my computer which forced me to forfeit. Sorry about that. Give my opponent the conduct point. 1st, just because most Americans are pro-death penalty does not mean that we should do what they say. 139 countries having abolished it after using capital punishment for 10 or more years compared to 58 nations actively using it today. Just because the people agree with something does not mean it should be allowed! This is just an example which does not have to be true: If the majority of the people think that mosques should not be allowed to be built in all circumstances, does it make what they said right? This is a huge problem! People assuming that whatever the majority of the people believe, it's always right and that we should do what they say. 2nd of all, the concept that it deters crime does not account for many things. How does capital punishment save lives? Is my opponent honestly saying that because the USA allows death penalties that it prevents crime? Crime is the greatest in the USA even though the USA have the death penalty and executed the 5th most people in the world recently. Many people are not affected by the death penalty as to see that it depends on what kind of crimes they are but many people would rather be able to gain money, drugs, revenge, or something addicting by doing a crime even though of the risks. They don't think of the consequences but they just do it without thinking or considering the death penalty. Just because all of the people that you have said believes that the death penalty deters crime can not beat back the 87% of expert criminologists who say that the death penalty does not help deter crime at all and the 88% of the top criminologists who say that the abolition of the death penalty would not have any significant effect on crime rates. Also For 2010, the average Murder Rate of Death Penalty States was 4.6, while the average Murder Rate of States without the Death Penalty was 2.9. Also all of the top 10 states with crime all have the death penalty. It's also not biased in the size of the state rather per 100,000 people. In 2008, 14 states without capital punishment were either at or below the national homicide rates. So all of your supposed ""facts"" in this contention are all wrong because they can't beat back all of these points that I have been showing to you. Also there can be and there has been wrongful executions. As many as 39 people in the U.S. have been executed from 1992 to 2004 because of the death penalty. 138 death row defendants were released since 1973 because of wrongful convictions and withheld papers. That is extremely unfair because of costing one's life just because of the death penalty. Even being in jail because of a misjudgement is better than being executed in the case of a misjudgement. Plus the death penalty is racially biased. 77% of death row defendants are executed for killing a white person but half of the victims are black. . I have so many more points I would like to make and also go into detail about many of them but I have to move on to the other contentions. 3rd of all, the death penalty doesn't actually give any closure to victim families. Sure, the victim's families may hate the defendants and want to hurt them but the death penalty doesn't actually help them feel any better. Let's take a look at Achilles when he lost his best friend Patroclus in the Trojan War. He was dissatisfied with all of the slaughtering of the Trojans and the torturing and killing of the killer Hector but was still empty until the day that he wept for an entire night with the killer's father. Sure, loss of friends and family members will always be a sad thing but the killing of the murderer doesn't necessarily put back what the people close to that victim have lost. The families will never totally recover and revenge by the death penalty is from the government is not going to put an ""ending chapter to this mess"". I also ask my opponent to tell me how many murderers in jail until they die have escaped and haunted the family. Also about releasing killers, would you give me some facts please? I have made my point that the death penalty has no significant effect and will never put an ""ending chapter to this mess"" on the people close to the murdered person. 4th of all, is justice served if he has to live in jail for the rest of his life? Yes! Justice is not better served by death penalty than living in jail for the rest of your life. Death is getting executed but life in jail till death is everyday torture knowing you will live the rest of your life in a cell. I would say life in jail till death serves justice better than the death penalty because if you die, you die. No more suffering, pain, hardships. None of the bad things or good things. But life in a prison cell until death is torture for many years to come. 5th of all, if God doesn't tell us to do the death penalty why should we do it. The fist two verses are from the Old Testament which is specifically God the Father wanted the Israelites to use capital punishment because there was no other way to do it. If you disagree with that statement, I bet you $10 (not $10,000 like Romney but $10 like Gingrich) thats you won't be able to find another way to punish a murder or death that is not capital punishment during their time which is an estimated to be after Ahmose and before Assyrians and Babylonians take over Israel and Judah. Also few people would use the capital punushment as the Old Testament says such as doing work on the Sabbath, false prophecy or making false statements about a woman's virginity. In the 3rd verse, it clearly doesn't mean a literal meaning. It means that Christians must not use their freedom from the Old Testament religious Law as an excuse to violate the civil law. We must obey civil authority, which is instituted by God, because of fear of punishment as well as conscience. The principles set forth by Jesus and the apostles restrict punishment to only that which is necessary to protect society and rather than giving. Jesus taught great principles for us to apply in our lives, rather than specific laws. Thus, his failure to specifically condemn slavery, capital punishment and many other evils should not be interpreted as approval of capital punishment. I see the mercy He showed to the woman caught in adultery as His rejection of capital punishment. However, Jesus never specifically repudiated capital punishment. Even if you want to go by the Old Testament which is totally irrelevant, the Ten Commandments in Exodus 20:13 says ""Though shall not kill."" The original Hebrew word ratsach, translated as ""kill"" or ""murder"" could refer to either killing in general or unlawful killing (murder). This is only if you want to argure the irrelevant way. 6th of all, ""it is constitutional"" is not a good reason. The Constitution has been changed so much and is always debated about if a part is correct or not. Just because our current law says that doesn't mean that it's right. If a country's ""constitution"" says that slavery is allowed, is that right? There are many flaws in every country's laws and this is one of them. 7th of all, the death penalty costs and diverts much more resources from genuine crime control and more expensive than alternative sentences. Death penalty is not at all cheap but expensive. The death penalty does cost a lot and may be more than life in jail but it depends on the time. Death penalty costs a whole lot on a one time event, life in jail costs a little every year so that is why death penalty is more expensive because it's a one time event. I have negated all of my opponent's contentions and have made my own points in the crowded rebuttal of my 2nd contention. Vote Con!

death penalty,"C1. Self-Responsibility Whose fault is it for doing the crime? The criminal for doing the action of causing a threat towards society. He or she is the one responsible for their own actions, and should suffer the consequences. My opponent could argue about the potential mistakes about the Death Penalty, but stated under ""US death row study: 4% of defendants sentenced to die are innocent"", it states that only 4.1% of defendants, that are executed, are actually innocent. That is, in fact, a small percentage compared to the prison population in the US. And, I admit, that it is sad that a ""mistake"" happens with the killing of an innocent individual, but why was that individual in prison in the first place? Following the argument of self-responsibility, it was his or her mistake to be in prison in the first place; otherwise their death would not come. C2. Deters Crime This is a common argument used on both sides of whether or not the Death Penalty does or doesn't deter crime, but I will prove that it does deter crime within society. Supported evidence, from the article titled: ""The Death Penalty Deters Crime and Saves Lives"", it says: ""Criminals are no different from law-abiding people. Criminals rationally maximize their own self-interest (utility) subject to constraints (prices, incomes) that they face in the marketplace and elsewhere. Individuals make their decisions based on the net costs and benefits of each alternative. Thus, deterrence theory provides a basis for analyzing how capital punishment should influence murder rates. Over the years, several studies have demonstrated a link between executions and decreases in murder rates. In fact, studies done in recent years, using sophisticated panel data methods, consistently demonstrate a strong link between executions and reduced murder incidents"". To even further support the given evidence, state under another article titled: ""Do more executions mean fewer murders"", it states that each execution would help prevent at least 18 murders of innocent civilians. And also claims that the reason why it seems like the idea does not deter crime is because of how slow the executions take to get into effect. The article claims that if one murderer is executed instantly, it would prevent at least 1 murder of any civilian. So technically, the Death Penalty does deter crime; but the issue is how long it takes for the Death Penalty to take effect. In reality, the Death Penalty should be an instant action, instead of a long drawn out session when the final decision was made. C3. Economically Beneficial For this argument, let me please review the costs of the methods used within the Death Penalty. The cost for a Lethal Injection, stated under ""Methods of Execution"", is about $86.06. That is much cheaper than the most common method of the Electric Chair, which runs about $265,000. And as we know, technology is advancing within our society; and other methods for killing are being introduced. One example is that in a recent article from Ohio, a state that approves the Death Penalty, they are inventing new methods for it. The given example is the ""Robotic Arm"", where it decapitates the Criminal quickly and pain free. It also plays calming music so the Criminal is not suffering as much as compared with other methods. The pricing for the Robotic Arm would be expensive, but would be a one time buy. Some changes in machinery would be needed, but that is actually more economically beneficial than the other methods presented. As well as if we look at the costs, while a criminal is on Death Row, it shows that it is the result of costing more money, than actually saving money. Stated under ""Costs of the Death Penalty"", it states that the reason why people claim the Death Penalty is expensive is because of how long the execution takes. The prices, for trials and such, reach up to about 1 billion dollars. That is a lot, just to prove the ""innocence"" of a murderer! C4. The Bible Agrees with the Death Penalty Stated under both the Old Testament and New, God agrees that the Death Penalty should be used as punishment for ones crimes. From Genesis 9:6, ""Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man"". This quote is simply referring to how many people put a focus more on human rights, than God himself; or if we do not want to get into a Religious argument, the consequence for a criminals action. Self responsibilty, or an ""Eye for an eye"". And to even further this argument, from Revelation 13:10, ""He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints"". Which simply means that if we have it, we should use it to bring justice amongst society. C5. The Death Penalty Brings Justice: For this argument, I wish to present the definition of ""justice"". Justice is defined as:""Just behavior or treatment"". Basicvally, bringing a balance a good feeling towards society. The Death Penalty fulfills this burden by murdering the person, for taking another innocent civilians life. Stated under ""A Just Society Requires the Death Penalty for the Taking of Another Life"", it says: ""When someone takes a life, the balance of justice is disturbed. Unless that balance is restored, society succumbs to a rule of violence. Only the taking of the murderer's life restores the balance and allows society to show convincingly that murder is an intolerable crime which will be punished in kind"". Simple enough concept, but many argue about human rights,insteadof arguing about the fact of a criminal taking accountability for his or her own actions. C6. Promotes a Better Environment in Prisons Imagine the feeling of being a prison guard, going through the cells and possibly being murdered. It is a scary feeling, and as a society, we need to bring safety to the guards environment. How? By the usage of the Death Penalty, which eliminates all the threats of murders within the prison. Quoted from the New York Times article ""The Death Penalty can Create a Better Prison Environment"", it says: ""Surely the men and women who guard our prisons deserve society's respect, support and protection. The death penalty for certain crimes inside of prisons is one way of protecting them from being murdered on the job. The sooner we give them this, the sooner their ranks will grow to include more compassionate, better educated people truly able to reform the system at all levels"". Are we at the point of neglecting the safety of the innocent, to the criminals because of the Death Penalty being horrid? The Death Penalty would prevent the possible murders within the prisons environment. Under the document ""Mortality in Local Jails and State Prisons, 2000–2012 - Statistical Tables"", it states that in 2012 we had an 8% increase in murders within prisons, and is increasing as the years pass by. And most of these murders have occured within inmates who are on Death Row, and Mentally Ill Inmates. The percentage totaling up to 67%, which is a lot for an inmate about to get the Death Penalty. So once more, instead of taking the time to commence the Death Penalty; just do it when it is sentenced. C7. Prevents Overpopulation within Prisons Stated under the article, ""The United States Has The Largest Prison Population In The World "" And It""s Growing"", it states that within our country 1.57 million inmates are occupying any sort of cell. The most common crime, taken in 2013, involve physical harm. Stated under ""Criminal Victimization"", the highest number of crimes involve mostly any physical harm to the victim. Examples being rape, assault, or even murder; and the scary part is that at least 1/3 of the inmates are involved in this sort of crime. This is a high number for prisoners and needs to be reduced, hence the reasoning of why the Death Penalty should be used. The Death Penalty will lower the overpopulation of inmates, and actually have room for inmates that deserve to be in prison for drug abuse, and or other charges. As well as protect the more ""innocent"" of the inmates from the aggression of these violent criminals actions or influence. And also bring along more protection for the public. with the Death Penalty, we can lower the numbers of prison population! Given the arguments, we can see that the Death Penalty has its benefits towards our society.

death penalty,"Thanks to con for his response. First of, I'll be playing devil's advocate here, I object to capital punishment, but it's nice being on the opposing side. Second, I'd like to point out that I'm having some difficulties understanding your grammar, it would be best if you review them carefully before posting. Now, my rebuttal: The legal system is a procedure process for obtaining an objective, to interpret and enforce the laws, laws which were made by the legislative goverment, by people, and people make mistakes, therefore, the law is not perfect and mistakes can happen. Capital punishment is not murder, murder is an unlawful premeditated killing, whereas the death penalty is a legitimate execution under the law. We send soldiers to war and kill, but we don't call them murderers, in fact, we can say we're proud of them, killing those 'terrorists' who took part in 9/11, yet we don't give them a fair trial, unlike the people in jail awaiting trial. America does hold a sanctity of life, it gives retribution to the loved ones an innocent victim who lost his/her life, taken away and victimized by a maniac. 1) -- The death penalty can and has killed innocent people, the government has killed innocents making it murder. As I said, the legal system is not perfect, the people can make mistakes, we are not proud of it, but it's part of the process. Call it murder is you want, but I have stated that the death penalty is a legitimate execution by the state. Under the death penalty rules technically all the people in the cases with innocent people killed should themselves be put on trial and killed. However it doesn't work that way, the accused is the only one getting blamed for a crime and if innocent but proven guilty will get the death penalty but then proven innocent after the sentence has already been carried out the government just goes oops sorry. I don't quite understand these sentences due to your grammar but I assume you mean that all defendants, when faced with a crime and convicted, automatically gets the death penalty. I'll tell you this, not all states and countries have capital punishment, not all crimes recquire the death penalty. When on death row, there's still hope, you can appeal to the higher courts, if you are really proven innocent beyond reasonable doubt, then they can overturn the sentence and exonerate you. You are given time when you're in death row. 2) -- Death penalty cost more than life in prison without parole. Evidence : Dudley Sharp, Death Penalty Resources Director of Justice For All (JFA), in an Oct. 1, 1997 Justice for All presentation titled ""Death Penalty and Sentencing Information,"" wrote: ""Many opponents present, as fact, that the cost of the death penalty is so expensive (at least $2 million per case?), that we must choose life without parole ('LWOP') at a cost of $1 million for 50 years. Predictably, these pronouncements may be entirely false. JFA estimates that LWOP cases will cost $1.2 million - $3.6 million more than equivalent death penalty cases. There is no question that the up front costs of the death penalty are significantly higher than for equivalent LWOP cases. There also appears to be no question that, over time, equivalent LWOP cases are much more expensive... than death penalty cases. Opponents ludicrously claim that the death penalty costs, over time, 3-10 times more than LWOP."" Hmm, think it speaks for itself, I've highlighted the obvious, so the death penalty does not cost more than LWOP. Thanks for pointing that out. My case/conclusion: The death penalty gives justice to the ones who are also victimized in the past, it's better than LWOP, LWOP doesn't exactly mean 'life sentence', anything can happen; what are the chances of the serial rapist breaking out of prison and never coming back, or laws being changed, it can affect the sentencing laws which affects the prisoners, before you know it, more killers may be out in no time because of the change. he may harm more innocent lives, rape more people, what about the chances of a lunatic maniac going on a killing spree? Criminals are likely to commit more crimes when out, that's why DP is better, it can save potential lives, outside and inside prison, it prevents the criminal to commit more crimes, it prevents murder and death. Thank you.",PRO,"We send soldiers to war and kill, but we don't call them murderers, in fact, we can say we're proud of them, killing those 'terrorists' who took part in 9/11, yet we don't give them a fair trial, unlike the people in jail",363
death penalty,"Well, I thank my opponent for this debate, An interesting subject, I think myself. I'll be presenting my own reasons then on why the death penalty ought currently be a good thing. Innocents are injured and lost in any endeavor I would say. Whether in war, Store policies, Societal regulations, And so on. This is not good. But even when one chooses no action, Events continue. Many times worse than if we had taken action. Yes, When a person life is lost. That is rather final. Irreversible really. But, There are reasons the death penalty exists. When a murderer is given a lifetimes worth of paroles, Is given such and murders again. Is the innocent that he murdered given any chance at life again? Does the justice system make it their business to sentence to execution the innocent? No! I say. Innocent life lost is an unfortunate byproduct of the best path that we might take. On deterrence. Perhaps the death penalty is not a true deterrence to them. Often they slip the proverbial noose so to speak by reason of insanity. For the slightly though no less mad, The death penalty exists to remove them from society. And for the sane. Motivated by whatever sin is their flavor, Cunningly concocting plan or carrying through their desires in manner quite foul. Still they cannot grasp that they want if they are dead, Cannot enjoy spoils behind bar or grave. Fear makes some work there. Cost Yes, My opponent is correct that the death penalty is more costly at this time. But is that reason to argue against the death penalty? Or more, Is it reason to argue against the current plans. Methods of trial, And procedures that lead to the death penalty? As an example. Do you think that people who vote against marijuana being legalized, Intend their vote to mean ""I want the government to waste it's time and money ruining peoples lives if they have a gram of marijuana on them""? No, Rather they, I think would want the government to simply seize the substance if illegal, To prosecute a dealer to children as they would a tobacco or alcohol dealer to children. The problem is not the idea of the law, The concept. The problem is in the execution of the idea. The prison system as it is, Is a costly sore to the public. Irritating and so often unasked by the taxpayer. Renovation, Innovation are what is needed. Laws, Prisons, The Death Penalty. These will exist in societies. It seems an unrealistic approach to try to remove them in a moment in our current society. Rather we must learn to go about them in a manner less wasteful, Less harmful, But acknowledge their existence and current permanence. But these matters speak of the materials wasted, Of the few injustices made to the innocent.

death penalty,"C1: The right to life “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men” As quoted above, The general consensus in the U.S. is that the primary function of government is to secure people’s rights. Some of which are unalienable. In the United States, life is considered an unalienable right. This is evident by the quote above taken from the Declaration of Independence. How is it that the State can function as a securer of the individual right to life while simultaneously taking a person’s life? Simply put, it cannot. The State does have the right to remove those who violate other’s rights from society. However, the State has no legitimate cause to take away one’s unalienable right to life. This is true even for the worst individuals imaginable. For the State to take one’s life via capital punishment is for the State to function contrary to its primary purpose. Life as a right should remain unalienable. C2: Innocents At least 18 people have been wrongly executed. 18 people have had their unalienable right to life taken from them unjustly. (1) What cost is my opponent willing to pay for so called justice that she is willing to endorse the unjust action of the state taking people’s lives. C3: Cost Trying a death penalty case and the process of carrying it out cost significantly more than life in prison. (2) “the enhanced cost of trying a death penalty case is at least $1.25 million more than trying a comparable murder case resulting in a sentence of life in prison without parole.” (3) C4: A reasonable alternative “In every state that retains the death penalty, jurors have the option of sentencing convicted capital murderers to life in prison without the possibility of parole. The sentence is cheaper to tax-payers and keeps violent offenders off the streets for good. Unlike the death penalty, a sentence of Life Without Parole also allows mistakes to be corrected.” (4) Overview: The Death Penalty is more expensive than the alternative. Innocent people have been and likely will be executed. The States involvement in the death penalty is contrary to the purpose of government and infringes on unalienable rights. Life in prison without parole is a reasonable, cost effective alternative to the death penalty that gives the desired result without the potential harm the Death Penalty does. Due to the inherent harm of the death penalty and reasonable alternatives, the Death penalty should be abolished. Sources (1) http://www.deathpenalty.org... (2) http://www.forbes.com...

death penalty,"I will be proposing four reasons why the Death Penalty should not be utilized in the United States. Human Error Humans make mistakes, so it is very possible that the wrong person could get persecuted for a crime. There are many reasons that there would be an error in picking the correct person. There is a lot of pressure put upon persecutors by the community when there is a particularly brutal crime, such as a rape/murder. The increased pressure can cause the prosecutor to make hasty decisions when deciding the verdict so as to appease the need for justice, which can result in the wrong person being put on death row.[1] Putting someone completely innocent to death is a risk that cannot be taken. Lack of Deterrence The threat of the death penalty does not often stop people from committing the crimes that could get them put on death row. People who are in a fit of fear or rage, under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol, or have a mental disability which causes them to commit the crime are very unlikely to think about the possibility of being executed.[2] As recent as 2011, the murder rate has actually been higher in states that utilized the death penalty.[3] This shows a lack of the death penalty actually deterring crimes, which defeats one of it's main purposes. Cost The procedures and trials that must take place in a death penalty case take longer, and are therefore more costly than the average life without parole (LWOP) case. For example, in Colorado, it takes six times more days to settle a capital case than a LWOP case.[4] That, in turn, causes the price to be exponentially higher. The average cost for a federal case in which the death penalty is being sought is $620,932. That is about eight times more expensive than the average federal case where the death penalty is not an element.[4] Though the means of carrying out the execution itself can be considered reasonably priced, the procedures that precede the execution are very expensive. Hypocrisy People may see it fit that someone who killed someone should be killed, but wouldn't that mean that the person who carried out the execution of the guilty party deserves to be killed as well? The argument, “an eye for an eye” seems like it makes sense, but in reality, the people carrying out the death penalty would be no better than the person who was executed. It is hypocritical to punish someone for murder by killing them. The death penalty contradicts its motives. Sources: [1]http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org...

death penalty,"For this round, I will Rebuttal once more of why the Death Penalty is necessary society. How I will do this is by, once more, by taking a quote and providing a Rebuttal on why the Death Penalty is necessary. As well as tying my Rebuttal's to my argument. For Example Back on March 17, 2015 Cecil Clayton was put to death without no legal reason in the year 1972 Mr.Cecil Clayton sustained a work related injury to his brain in a saw-mill accident and later after that he was diagnosed with dementia but before his diagnosis he had Violent impulses and Schizophrenia and in 1983 it got so bad he decided to check him into a mental asylum or institution during his brain MRI it was revealed that he was missing his frontal lobe which deals with problem solving and impulse control.A picture of his brain is shown below in the link. My opponent continues the debate about the mental illness of people. In the previous round, I stated: ""I go with the idea that if the individual is potential harm to society, they should be executed for the protection of others"". Do I still stand with this idea, of course because why should we protect those who already decided their fate? Believe me, I know about mental illnesses especially when my younger brother has one (Autism); and its his fate of whether or not he gets in trouble. The same applies to these individuals, but for the sake of argument; how many individuals in prison have a mental illness. Stated from ""Mental Health America""(1), it states: ""It is estimated that 5-10 percent of people on death row have a serious mental illness"". How many recieve the death penalty, according to the article only 3 percent of mental health inmates recieved the Death Penalty. That is pretty low for something to be considered ""serious"" because not many prisoners have a mental illness. And those who do have a mental illness and go on death row balances everything out, so ""special priviledges"" aren't existant in prison. Those who commit a serious enough crime deserve to be put to death, even those who are slightly different. There are many more reasons why the death penalty is bad some are the following ""The death penalty system in the US is applied in an unfair and unjust manner against people,largely dependent on how much money they have, the skill of their attorneys, race of the victim and where the crime took place. People of color are far more likely to be executed than white people, especially if the victim is white This respone to those who are against the Death Penalty is very repetitive, that those who are a different race get put to death more than white individuals. First off, this is ""bull"" because those who are put to death are the ones who decided their fate. I ask my opponent ""Who decides to murder someone in cold blood, or rape that woman, or man""? The criminal themselves, and if they decided this; how is it unfair. For the race aspect of the Death Penalty, lets look at a few statistics conducted in 2014 on who has been executed more often. Stated under ""Death Penalty Information Center"" (2), the amount of race deaths carried out since 1976 showed that 55.4% of those executed were white and 34.7% were Black. That is a huge number difference to what my opponent stated, and would also like to point out that my opponent failed to show any evidence to support his claim. There is something out there called the Brutlation effect and with one major reason why the death penalty as stated and QUOTED below ""The death penalty is brutal on society. The brutalization effect suggests that when violence is condoned via the death penalty, more violence occurs. Homicide rates tend to increase around the time of executions, due to legitimation, desensitization, and imitation. The death penalty makes society more dangerous by further increasing violence through the brutalization effect. Then my opponent discusses an effect called the ""Brutalization Effect"". Do I know this effect, I actually do because of studying both Criminal Justice and Criminology in college. This idea is more so a theory, than an actual fact. Because there has also been many theories that those who commited crime were because of demons, and that society is the main reason crime is ensued. More so ideas, than actual facts. To counter my opponent, I wish to provide a statistic that shows that the Death Penalty deters crime ""a 2008 comprehensive review of capital punishment research since 1975 by Drexel University economist Bijou Yang and psychologist David Lester of Richard Stockton College of New Jersey concluded that the majority of studies that track effects over many years and across states or counties find a deterrent effect (3)"". The article even states that the use of the death penalty even once actually saves one victim within the country. To conclude, my opponent makes arguments, but fails to provide a whole ton of facts. More so ideas, and a more opinion based argument than anything else. Before I conclude this argument however, I was told to provide a video with the Death Penalty. Here it is: The crime was for the murdering of a father, nd they executed him with letal injection. Like many say ""An eye for an eye"".

death penalty,"The death penalty should not be used as a punishment for a number of reasons. The two I will be focusing on in this debate are listed below. 1. The death penalty has the potential to cause the death of innocent people if it is incorrectly applied. The justice system is not without flaws, and suspects are often wrongfully convicted of crimes and later released. In a case where the death penalty is carried out, the penalty can never be reversed. 2. The death penalty is murder. Murder is defined by the Merriam-Webster Dictionary as ""the crime of unlawfully killing a person especially with malice aforethought."" Therefore, the only difference between murder and capital punishment is the term ""unlawfully."" The punishment itself is the crime that it is being used to punish people for. 3. Advocates of the death penalty sometimes cite the deterrent effect of the death penalty, but I challenge anyone to find reliable evidence to support this. The types of crimes committed which are punished by the death penalty cannot be deterred. A murder can be a crime of passion, in which case it cannot be deterred because it is impulsive. A person who commits a murder in the heat of the moment does not think about consequences. A murderer could also be motivated by profit. A criminal of this type almost always operates under the assumption that he or she will not be caught. If you don't think you'll be caught, they are unlikely to seriously consider the consequences. In general, the type of criminal that commits a murder is not deterred as easily as other criminals and ordinary citizens.",CON,"Therefore, the only difference between murder and capital punishment is the term ""unlawfully."" ...

death penalty,"Firstly, your response included no factual date to support your claim that ""feeding an housing and heating and cooling those institutions that are already quite crowded is going to cost even more money."" According to the L.A. Times, ""the California death penalty system costs taxpayers $114 million per year beyond the costs of keeping convicts locked up for life. Taxpayers have paid more than $250 million for each of the state's execution."" This quotation is factual proof that the death penalty is far more expensive than keeping someone incarcerated for a life term. Secondly, their is no doubt that they're exists people who are considered extremely dangerous, but who can be kept incarcerated and away from the general population. When imposing the death penalty, we run the risk of executing an innocent person, which is truly an irreversible mistake. A clear example of this statement is the execution of Jessee Tafero. After Mr. Tafero was executed, while his Writ of Habeas Corpus was pending, doubts arose as to his involvement in the murder of two polices officers. Mr. Tafero was convicted by an over zealous Judge who had a strong belief in the death penalty. Ultimately, Mr. Tafero's Co-Defendant was released from prison while Mr. Tafero was wrongly executed by means of the electric chair. According to US Senator Russ Feingold, ""Since the reinstatement of the modern death penalty, 87 people have been freed from death row because they were later proven innocent"". The fact that these people were on Death Row is troubling, given that they were innocent and could have been wrongfully executed. Supreme Court Justice Harry A. Blackmun states ""rather than continue to coddle the court's delusion that the desired level of fairness has been achieved...I feel...obligated simply to concede that the death penalty experiment has failed.""

death penalty,"What you have said is true ! But it certainly isnt good. Innocent people are killed for such an act of being charged with the death penalty. And it's always the African American race. Total number of death row exonerations in the USA since 1973: 144 Approximately 60% of all death row exonerees are non-white From 2000-2007, there have been an average of 5 exonerations per year Average number of years between being sentenced to death and exoneration: 10.1 years Number of cases in which DNA played a substantial factor in establishing innocence: 18 DPIC's criteria for inclusion: Defendants must have been convicted, sentenced to death and subsequently either: a) their conviction was overturned AND i) they were acquitted at re-trial or ii) all charges were dropped; or b) they were given an absolute pardon by the Governor based on new evidence of innocence The most common causes of wrongful convictions are; eyewitness error, government misconduct, junk science, snitch testimony and false confessions. This tells exactly that the innocent is killed. It's also bad because families have to see their children or parents etc. killed, and it is very sad. Numerous families and loved ones of murder victims support alternatives to the death penalty for many reasons, including: The death penalty process is a traumatizing experience for families, often requiring them to relive the pain and suffering of the death of their loved one for many years. Life without parole provides certain punishment without the endless reopening of wounds. Hundreds of millions of dollars are spent on the death penalty each year. If we replace the death penalty with life without parole, millions of dollars could be spent on violence-prevention efforts, solving unsolved cases, and increasing victim services. The death penalty places the focus on the legal consequences, not the human consequences. Attention is directed on the crime and the accused, instead of where it belongs "" on the family and loved ones of the victim and on the community. Life without parole punishes the criminal without putting him or her in the headlines. I state facts of how this is bad. Of how the death penalty is an act of execution towards the good and the bad. Plus the Death Penalty is expensive. The death penalty is much more expensive than life without parole because the Constitution requires a long and complex judicial process for capital cases. This process is needed in order to ensure that innocent men and woman are not executed for crimes they did not commit, and even with these protections the risk of executing an innocent person can not be completely eliminated. If the death penalty was replaced with a sentence of Life Without the Possibility of Parole*, which costs millions less and also ensures that the public is protected while eliminating the risk of an irreversible mistake, the money saved could be spent on programs that actually improve the communities in which we live. The millions of dollars in savings could be spent on: education, roads, police officers and public safety programs, after-school programs, drug and alcohol treatment, child abuse prevention programs, mental health services, and services for crime victims and their families. *More than 3500 men and women have received this sentence in California since 1978 and NOT ONE has been released, except those few individuals who were able to prove their innocence. California could save $1 billion over five years by replacing the death penalty with permanent imprisonment.

death penalty,"I appreciate the opportunity to debate such a interesting topic, with an intelligent opponent. For reference, I will be responding to my opponents three main arguments, and then bringing up some points of my own. So let's get to it, shall we? Argument 1: Costs -- Counter I have two main responses to this argument. 1. Costs are offset by plea bargains. The very presence of the death penalty induces defendants to agree to plea bargains that involve non-capital sentencing[1]. This, therefore, bypasses any cost that might be involved. It also must be noted that plea bargains are widely used, so the death penalty is used less often. 2. Lives saved by deterrence justify the cost. Now, I can't go deep into this until I respond to my opponents second argument, but I can say that if the death penalty has a deterrent effect, it is deterring something valuable enough for the extra cost. That is to say, if the death penalty saves lives, then the cost is justified. Argument 2: Deterrence -- Counter Before I talk about deterrence as a whole, I would like to point out something. I noticed that my opponent talked a lot about people with mental illness not being deterred by the death penalty in this argument. I would like everyone to be aware of the insanity plea, in which a defendant can argue insanity to get out of a capitol punishment, so in that effect this argument is invalid. On to the arguments. I have two responses. 1. 1 execution prevents 18 murders. Let me quote from the American Law & Econ Review in 2003[2] ""Our results show that capitol punishment has a strong deterrent effect; each execution results, on average, in eighteen fewer murders. Tests show that results not driven by tougher sentencing laws and are robust to other alternative specifications."" This quote clearly says 1 execution prevents 18 murders. Let's go back to cost. Now, I said that if the death penalty saves lives, then cost is justified. If the quote I just posted is true, then more than enough lives are saved to justify the cost. I'm not done though. 2. Empirics My opponent stated that in Iowa there is a lower murder rate than Minnesota, which has capitol punishment. My response is that the population of Iowa is much lower than the population of Minnesota, by about 2 million people, and that this is why murder rate is low -- not because of the death penalty. Plus, my opponent never linked Iowa's low crime rates to an absence of the death penalty, nor did he link Minnesota's high crime rates to the presence of the death penalty. So this argument was vague and incorrect. The Texas Tech University Law Review did a more conclusive study on moratoriums on the death penalty that occurred in Texas and Illinois in 2008. Their research[3] showed that in the five years the death penalty was banned in Illinois, 150 murders that could have been prevented, weren't. In the one year the death penalty was banned in Texas, 221 murders weren't prevented. That's a total of 371 murders. 371 murders that could of, and should of been stopped, but were not. We have a responsibility to keep the death penalty in place for this reason. Argument 3: Innocence -- Counter Once again -- two responses. 1. Time. That is to say, that the average time between the arrest of a death row inmate and the execution of one, is 28 years. That's 28 years of evidence gathering, and witness interrogation, and plea bargaining, etc. This is plenty of time to come to a watertight conclusion, and if it's not, I would be genuinely surprised. 2. No proof. The other response is that there has never any conclusive proof that any of the inmates executed in modern times were innocent[4]. Think about it -- In a thirty year period no has had an absolute exoneration. There are only two reasons this would be so. 1. Widespread evidence tampering, or 2. Death Penalty convictions are correct. I plan to talk about this more in my rebuttals as so my opponent can expound upon this a little more. Now let's talk about the disadvantages with getting rid of the death penalty. Disadvantage 1: Prison Chaos. If we get rid of the death penalty, then I am sure that my opponent and I both agree, that life without parole will be the number 1 way of sentencing violent crime. The problem is, is that life without parole has a serious problem[5]. The criminal convicted with that sentence have nothing to lose. You come to two terrifying scenarios. Either 1: The criminal spends his life planning and scheming so as to escape, or 2: The criminal kills other inmates and guards, because he has nothing else to be threatened with. Both can be potentially threatening to innocents and convicts alike. The only way to make sure the criminal never kills again, is with the death penalty. Disadvantage 2: Lost Plea Bargaining This ties in to my previous argument. As I said, plea bargains are very effective, and serve to incapacitate the criminal, but can only maintain effectiveness if there is something serious to negotiate about. The death penalty is that serious thing. It is an almost definite fact that a criminal will give in when death is on the line. If the death penalty is removed, what do criminals have to fear[6]? We have lost a great tool in keeping criminals behind bars. The only way to ensure this power is with the death penalty. I hope I've shown you a number of things: 1. Plea Bargaining offsets death penalty costs. 2. If the death penalty deters, the cost is justified. 3. The death penalty deters. 4. Innocents rarely, if ever, get the death penalty. 5. Absence of the death penalty causes prison chaos. and 6. Absence of the death penalty makes us lose important plea bargaining power. I look forward to the rounds ahead. :) [1]http://www.cjlf.org...

death penalty,"I argue that the Death Penalty has an overall negative effect on society. I Propose that: 1) Death is cruel and unusual, no matter what the crime was or what method of execution is used. Here are two examples of botched executions: April 22, 1983 Alabama John Evans Electrocution: After the first jolt of electricity, sparks and flames erupted from the electrode attached to Evans's leg. The electrode burst from the strap holding it in place and caught on fire. Smoke and sparks also came out from under the hood in the vicinity of Evans's left temple. Two physicians entered the chamber and found a heartbeat. The electrode was reattached to his leg, and another jolt of electricity was applied. This resulted in more smoke and burning flesh. Again the doctors found a heartbeat. Ignoring the pleas of Evans's lawyer, a third jolt of electricity was applied. The execution took 14 minutes and left Evans's body charred and smoldering. April 23, 1998 Texas Joseph Cannon Lethal Injection: It took two attempts to complete the execution. After making his final statement, the execution process began. A vein in Cannon's arm collapsed and the needle popped out. Seeing this, Cannon lay back, closed his eyes, and exclaimed to the witnesses, ""It's come undone."" Officials then pulled a curtain to block the view of the witnesses, reopening it fifteen minutes later when a weeping Cannon made a second final statement and the execution process resumed. There are a total of 42 botched executions listed on the Death Penalty Information Center website. According to Avalon Project database, the eighth amendment states: Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted. http://avalon.law.yale.edu... http://deathpenaltyinfo.org... 2) Overall the Death Penalty costs more to maintain rather than the life sentence in prison. Capital punishment cases go through several appeals costing millions of dollars, and of those cases only a few actually receive the death penalty. According to Independent Weekly, IDS is a publicly funded agency that provides private attorneys for defendants charged with capital crimes, but cannot afford a lawyer. Of 733 defendants in North Carolina that IDS represented, less than 3%, or around 20 people received the death penalty. However , millions of tax dollars still went into each of those cases. Independent Weekly also stated that North Carolina spent an additional $36 million dollars between 2001 and 2008 on the death penalty that could have been used elsewhere if the life in prison was the sentence used for heinous crimes. http://www.indyweek.com... 3) The Death Penalty has no proof of being a deterrent. According to the Death Penalty Information Center the U.S. Murder rate per 100,000 people has been fairly constant at around 5.5 to 5.7 per year. However, according to the Canadian Coalition against the Death penalty, Canada, which does not use the death penalty has had a rate around 1.9 to 2.2 over the past few years. Also, according to Speak Out .com, since the reinstatement of capital punishment in 1977, 552 people have been executed. That averages about one person every 22 days, so clearly the death penalty has no evidence of a deterrent to heinous crimes. http://deathpenaltyinfo.org... http://www.ccadp.org... http://speakout.com... 4) Many people have been executed innocently and obviously cannot be ""released"", however if life imprisonment was the preferred method of punishment they could be released. Although I do not have list of these cases there are 139 people listed on the Death Penalty Information Center for people who have been released from Death Row.

You argue the specifics of the nature of execution. We're talking about capital punishment in general. Appealing to specifics is immaterial when considering execution as a general topic. If you want to debate methods, fine, but it needs to be done on a state-by-state basis. Obviously there are states where this is NOT unusual. >>""when on death row you have a unlimited amout of appeals that are all paid for by our court systems. plus various other expences so yes even an 18 yr old sitting in jail for the rest of there life is cheaper then the death penalty. infact it cost."" Again - the fact that the appeals of inmates are paid for by the court is a failure of the judiciary system. Wonderful - I'm interested in capital punishment, not the failures of the judiciary system. >>""At the trial level, death penalty cases are estimated to generate roughly $470,000 in additional costs to the prosecution and defense over the cost of trying the same case as an aggravated murder without the death penalty and costs of $47,000 to $70,000 for court personnel. On direct appeal, the cost of appellate defense averages $100,000 more in death penalty cases, than in non-death penalty murder cases. Personal restraint petitions filed in death penalty cases on average cost an additional $137,000 in public defense costs."" You want to argue economics... very well... ""Total annual costs for all U.S. Prisons, State and Federal, was $17.7 billion in 1994 along with a total prison population of 1.1 million inmates. That amounts to $16100 per inmate/year. (GOA report and testimony FY-97 GGD-97-15)."" Keeping an inmate alive to the average age of 75 costs about $805,000 if they are 25 at the time of imprisonment. If they are 18, that figure rises to $917,700. Inmates only need to spend a little over 62 years in prison to cost 1 million to taxpayers, NOT COUNTING MEDICAL EXPENSES AS THEY AGE. It's perfectly reasonable for a person to live to 80. Imprisoned at 18, lives till 80 = 1 Million. You argue that it costs roughly $800,000 assuming ALL the above costs from your copied argument are actual. This is still less than 50 years in prison. And on top of that, here's an interesting little fact: The cost for the lethal injection drugs is only about $86 (http://www.tdcj.state.tx.us...) So somehow, the costs associated with the death penalty must go from that $86 to nearly $800,000 in costs OTHER THAN COURT CASES for the argument against the death penalty to hold water. Because the inmate could appeal his case and win, making the costs not relevant to the case. Lets consider a guilty person in a trial where the death penalty is sought. If they plead guilty and go to prison, they cost the taxpayer the $800,000 and are not killed. If they are guilty and given the death penalty, they cost the persons financially responsible for the guilty party the additional $470,000, plus the cost of injection ($86). The taxpayer's cost is IMMENSELY less to kill a person, rather than keep him alive for 50 years. There's also the consideration of the taxpayer - do they want to pay to keep a criminal alive, or do they want to pay to kill him? Current figures say about 65% will pay to kill him. >>""when innocent people die that is an issue with the death penalty. because if the death penalty was not used then those people would have a chance to prove. the death penalty is too perminate."" When innocent people die, that is obviously because the court has improperly rendered a verdict. Blaming the death penalty for these deaths is like saying that if someone aims a gun at the wrong target the gun is to blame for the death. That's ludicrous. The court is at fault for innocent deaths, not the death penalty. Besides, if they're innocent and get life in prison, you've argued that this is a worse penalty... so by your own logic, we should keep the death penalty because to do otherwise would impose a worse punishment on the innocent. >>""isnt life enough because studies show that people when kept away from other people go crazy and nuts litterally. and there life is over anyway so this is a worse punishment.""

death penalty,"I would like to thank my opponent for their response. Now onto rebuttals: My opponent mentions that the death penalty is more humane than being in jail. I whole-heartedly disagree with this. As I said before, the death penalty is state-sanctioned murder. Why do we get the right to decide who lives or dies? Yes, people commit horrendous crimes, regardless, you cannot tell someone not to murder and in the same breath say that you have the right to murder them. I would argue 2 points against their Prison=Misery argument: 1.Not all prisons are not as despicable as you make them out to be. Most prisons in the U.S. provide sufficient quarters for rooming, decent food, and space for exercising. No, prison isn""t luxurious but it isn""t supposed to be. In the cases of rape, it is disgusting how widespread prison rape is but that isn""t an excuse to say that killing prisoners would be easier. As you mention further in your argument, our prison system needs revamping. 2.And anyway, murder is worse. If the prisoner wanted to die, they could kill themselves. That is not up to the state (though I would prefer that nobody killed anyone). I do not care what crime the person committed, the death penalty is an unacceptable form of punishment. I agree that our prison system needs a reboot. Instead of just sending people to jail over and over again, we need to work on helping them get better. Framing a model inspired by Norway isn""t a bad idea though I advise against copying their system completely. However, your time period, 10 years, is ridiculous. You have no evidence to prove that a prisoner can be fully rehabilitated after 10 years. What makes you think that is a good number? Some people have deep seated issues and to put a time frame on their healing is absurd. Adding that kind of pressure is not helping matters. Prisoners are likely to pretend they are fine to avoid being killed, and then they""d end up back in jail because they weren""t truly rehabilitated. Also, I resent how you describe prisoners like they are animals. Euthanized? Really? These are people, human beings we are dealing with here. Even if the felon has committed the crime of rape or child molestation (which are disgusting), they SHOULD NOT be given the death penalty upon conviction. 1.Juries are not perfect because they are people. One, they have biases which can blind their better judgement and two, even without bias (which is impossible), juries make incorrect convictions. At least if the sentence was life imprisonment and the person is found innocent, yes they have lost years of their life but at least they aren""t dead despite being innocent. I""d say that is net better. In regards to bias, here is some more evidence from my R2 argument: ""The death penalty has also been proven to be biased towards white people and against people of color. The death penalty is also more likely to be applied when the defendant is black and the victim is white.. Martin O'Malley, JD, the former Governor of Maryland asserts: ""Our nation's legacy of slavery and racial injustice find continued offense in our use of the death penalty. Our death row population is more than 40% black -- nearly three times the proportion of the general population."" ""The death penalty is racist and has been applied in racially-discriminatory ways. African American men are disproportionately sentenced to death. Prosecutors, juries, and judges are much more likely to apply the death penalty when the victim is white and the defendant is black. Race is a ""potent influence"" at every step in the criminal (in)justice system, including search, arrest, indictment, trial, conviction, sentence, and execution."" 2.""""while any remaining evidence is found, appeals are exhausted, and retrials held. If the conviction upholds"""" This serves to attack your Prison=Expensive argument. No, the actual killing of the prisoner is not costly. What is costly is the trial. Because the death penalty is so severe, the trials take forever. The following is my Forbes evidence from R2: ""According to a study by the Kansas Judicial Council (downloads as a pdf), defending a death penalty case costs about four times as much as defending a case where the death penalty is not considered. In terms of costs, a report of the Washington State Bar Association found that death penalty cases are estimated to generate roughly $470,000 in additional costs to the prosecution and defense versus a similar case without the death penalty; that doesn't take into account the cost of court personnel... ...citing Richard C. Dieter of the non-partisan Death Penalty Information Center, Fox News has reported that studies have ""uniformly and conservatively shown that a death-penalty trial costs $1 million more than one in which prosecutors seek life without parole. And let's not forget about appeals: in Idaho, the State Appellate Public Defenders office spent about 44 times more time on a typical death penalty appeal than on a life sentence appeal (downloads as a pdf): almost 8,000 hours per capital defendant compared to about 180 hours per non-death penalty defendant. New York state projected that the death penalty costs the state $1.8 million per case just through trial and initial appeal."" It is crazy expensive because the death penalty is not just something you can apply to someone after they are convicted. The cases will be long and the prisoners are very likely to appeal which lengthen them even more. Prisoners appeal when the sentences are just jail time, why wouldn""t they appeal when it is death? I believe that the U.S. does need to improve our incarceration system but making the maximum prison sentence 10 years is not the way to do this. And killing an inmate is NOT how we rehabilitate people! Putting a time limit on rehabilitation is hypocritical and shows that the Pro doesn""t truly care about it. As I""ve said, convictions can be wrong and I don""t care if we kill just 1 innocent person, that""s 1 too many. Furthermore, the death penalty has not been shown to deter crime. This is some more Round 2 evidence: ""There is no evidence that the death penalty deters any crime whatsoever. Why are wasting taxpayer dollars for something that doesn't even have any benefits? ""Whether one compares the similar movements of homicide in Canada and the US when only the latter restored the death penalty, or in American states that have abolished it versus those that retain it, or in Hong Kong and Singapore (the first abolishing the death penalty in the mid-1990s and the second greatly increasing its usage at the same), there is no detectable effect of capital punishment on crime...""""

If I am able to prove otherwise, then the resolution shall be negated.** I would like to start off by defining key terms: death penalty- a sentence of punishment by execution; capital punishment. murder- the killing of another human being under conditions specifically covered in law. *""Death penalty"" may be replaced with ""capital punishment"" throughout the argument because they have the same meaning.* ======================================== Opening Statement: The death penalty violates our constitutional ban against cruel and unusual punishment and the guarantee of due process of law and the equal protection of laws. The enactment of the death penalty serves to be inconsistent with fundamental values of our democratic system. Capital punishment does not deter crime, and it is uncivilized in theory and unfair in practice. ======================================== I would like to quote my opponent: ""Do you think the death penalty should be legal even now"" I am taking the Con side of this debate, so I shall defend that the death penalty/capital punishment should not be legal, even now. ======================================== Contentions: I. Discrimination and Racism: a)In 96% of the states where there have been reviews of race and the death penalty, there was a pattern of either race-of victim or race-of-defendant discrimination, or both. (Prof. David Baldus report to the ABA, 1998). b) 98% of the chief district attorneys in death penalty states are white; only 1% are black. (Prof. Jeffrey Pokorak, Cornell Law Review, 1998). c) A comprehensive study of the death penalty in North Carolina found that the odds of receiving a death sentence rose by 3.5 times among those defendants whose victims were white. (Prof. Jack Boger and Dr. Isaac Unah, University of North Carolina, 2001). d) A study in California found that those who killed whites were over 3 times more likely to be sentenced to death than those who killed blacks and over 4 times more likely than those who killed Latinos. (Pierce & Radelet, Santa Clara Law Review 2005). II. Deterrence: a) According to a survey of the former and present presidents of the country's top academic criminological societies, 88% of these experts rejected the notion that the death penalty acts as a deterrent to murder. (Radelet & Lacock, 2009) b) Consistent with previous years, the 2006 FBI Uniform Crime Report showed that the South had the highest murder rate. The South accounts for over 80% of executions. The Northeast, which has less than 1% of all executions, again had the lowest murder rate. III. Financial Factors: a) The California death penalty system costs taxpayers $114 million per year beyond the costs of keeping convicts locked up for life. Taxpayers have paid more than $250 million for each of the state's executions. (L.A. Times, March 6, 2005) b) In Kansas, the costs of capital cases are 70% more expensive than comparable non-capital cases, including the costs of incarceration. (Kansas Performance Audit Report, December 2003). c) In Indiana, the total costs of the death penalty exceed the complete costs of life without parole sentences by about 38%, assuming that 20% of death sentences are overturned and reduced to life. (Indiana Criminal Law Study Commission, January 10, 2002). d) The most comprehensive study in the country found that the death penalty costs North Carolina $2.16 million per execution over the costs of sentencing murderers to life imprisonment. The majority of those costs occur at the trial level. (Duke University, May 1993). e) Enforcing the death penalty costs Florida $51 million a year above what it would cost to punish all first-degree murderers with life in prison without parole. Based on the 44 executions Florida had carried out since 1976, that amounts to a cost of $24 million for each execution. (Palm Beach Post, January 4, 2000). f) In Texas, a death penalty case costs an average of $2.3 million, about three times the cost of imprisoning someone in a single cell at the highest security level for 40 years. (Dallas Morning News, March 8, 1992). IV. Public Opinion: a) The May 2006 Gallup Poll found that overall support of the death penalty was 65% (down from 80% in 1994). The same poll revealed that when respondents are given the choice of life without parole as an alternate sentencing option, more choose life without parole (48%) than the death penalty (47%). b) A 1995 Hart Research Poll of police chiefs in the US found that the majority of the chiefs do not believe that the death penalty is an effective law enforcement tool. All of these contentions are directly from this source: http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org... If you can't pull the file up, the maincenter for death penalty information is: http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org... ================================================ I shall now provide my own, original contentions: (I will keep them short and sweet because many of the contentions above use sources I would use to prove these points) I. Cruel and Unusual: The death penalty goes against the eighth amendment. It is cruel and unusual due to the uses of various forms of execution. Even lethal injection can bring hours of pain when it does not function properly. II. The right to life and killing: Everyone has the right to life. It is immoral and unethical to take the life of someone. The death penalty kills the convicted and levels the government with the perpetrator. It teaches the old ""eye for an eye"" theory. However, an eye for an eye makes the world go blind. The death penalty encourages more uses of killing the convicted and does not set a healthy example for society. III. Innocence: There are still cases where the convicted was actually proven innocent, but after the execution was finished. There is margin for error and the death penalty does not give back a life that may be innocent. IV. Actual Punishment: The death penalty does not give the convicted the best form of punishment. Capital punishment ends the life of the convicted and he/she finds himself/herself getting out of trouble in a relatively painless way. Life in prison is a real punishment for the convicted: it gives him/her an especially long time to think about his/her shame and the way he/she ruined his/her life. This shall be all for now. I thank my opponent for the debate and the readers for this opportunity. I await a rebuttal. *P.S.* This is my own argument I created from one of my other debates. My previous opponent did not refute my points correctly, so I kept my same argument. I just wanted to clarify this is still my own, original argument. ==================================================== Sources: 1) http://dictionary.reference.com... 2) http://dictionary.reference.com... 3) http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org... 4) http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org... 5) http://users.rcn.com...",CON,"If I am able to prove otherwise, then the resolution shall be negated. ... ==================================================== Sources: 1) http://dictionary.reference.com... 2) http://dictionary.reference.com... 3)",377
death penalty,"I would like to thank my opponent for her accpetance, now on with the debate. Case I will be affirming the resolution that the death penalty is justified and that it should be kept as a punishment. My next contentions will show why it is a good form of punishment. Contention 1: Just must be served. My first point will be that justice must be served. The death penalty is only reserved for those who commit a act of murder. It is crucial that in a just society, the punishment must fit the crime. If a person violates another person's right to life, then justice demands that the violator's right to life be violated. Contention 2: The death penalty works as deterent. People who love their lives will not do anything to put it in jeperdy. So, sense murder ia a crime that is punishable by death, people will not murder. A great example would be Japan. They have the death penalty, and also have the lowest murder rate of anyother advanced country in the world [1]. Contention 3: The death penalty saves the lives of innocent people. The death penalty can and has saved tons of innocent lives. Studies have shown that in the U.S. 1.2% of offenders who committed murder were arrested within 3 years of being realeased because they murdered another person [2]. The number must become a zero. How do we do this? The death penalty, because it is the only way to make sure that the killers wont kill again. Conclusion Due to the fact that if a person kills a person then they themselves must also be killed, and that puting the murderer to death is the only way to make sure they do not murder anymore, it is just too make it a punishment whereever it is not.

death penalty,"I will answer each of your arguments in the order you posted them. Murder-1: the crime of unlawfully killing a person especially with malice aforethought Justice-c: the administration of law The death penalty clearly isn't murder, but rather justice, because it isn't unlawful, and it is the administration of the law. We don't use the death penalty to make the person scared, we use it to serve justice, and prevent anyone from ever doing what they have done again. We serve justice to make our country safe, not to make criminals pay for their crimes. If we wanted them to pay we wouldn't spend so much tax money on prisons. You state that you can be aqquited wrongly, but yet you don't deserve the punishment? That doesn't make sense. Please show me where exactly in the Constitution it states that the death penalty shouldn't be allowed. Cruel-1: disposed to inflict pain or suffering Unusual- not accordant with usage, custom, or habit The death penalty is used in a way which is quick, and painless, also it has been around for centuries upon centuries, and is not at all unusual. We shouldn't take away the death penalty because it is used unfairly, does that mean we should take away prisons too? Economic status, and race can effect sentence time, and whether or not you go too, then should we ban colleges? The poor can't afford college, it is clearly unfair to them. Maybe what you meant to say was that the administration of the death penalty should be better regulated. Same as above. Being wrongly convicted is nearly unheard of with today's technology. A criminal is also statistically proven to commit another crime. Do we really want repeat offenses by people who's first crimes were bad enough for the death penalty? We shouldn't let criminals get by just because it is expensive to serve justice. Educating people who aren't in the United States legally costs millions, but we still do that don't we? You have stated above that it is important innocent people don't get what they don't deserve, this is why we have appeals. Crimes worthy of the death penalty are much more than a painless lethal injection. We don't kill people for the sake of the fact that they have killed someone, you have to do much more than just kill someone for the death penalty, and we do it to keep the public safe. Same as above. We need to worry about the safety of the public, and serving justice, before we worry about foreign affairs. We must think about the safety of the public, and what the victims families have been through. To add to my arguments I would like to note that the death penalty is used sparingly, and crimes punishable by death are far worse than just murder. If we don't give these people what they deserve, we are allowing them to live for free off of the peoples taxes, without getting what they deserve, and, in a sense, they get away with their crime. If someone knows that they can kill, and live to tell about it, the chances of them doing it are greater, putting society in danger. You seem to have focused on cost, fairness, and morale example, but these aren't even caused by the death penalty, and you have forgotten the real reasons for the death penalty, the safety of the public, and justice.",PRO,"Murder-1: the crime of unlawfully killing a person especially with malice aforethought Justice-c: the administration of law The death penalty clearly isn't murder, but rather justice, because it isn't unlawful, and it is the",379
death penalty,"Thanks LegalizedProstitute. I will be providing four reasons why the Death Penalty should not be a punishment. Price Though the actual cost of the act of killing the criminal is relatively cheap, the processes leading up to that moment are extremely expensive, 1.25 million dollars more expensive than it is to have a life without parole case[1]. Perhaps some of you are asking if life without parole will eventually end up costing more than the death penalty due to the fact that inmates have to be housed and cared for the rest of their lives. This is not the case however, evidenced by the amount of money states save overall by imposing or not imposing the death penalty. Take California for example. Currently, conservative estimates place expenditures to be 137 million dollars per year(with death penalty)[1]. Estimates place California's expenditures at 11.5 million dollars in a legal system without the death penalty[1]. If California got rid of the death penalty, they could save a billion dollars in five years[1]. These statistics show that money is not saved over time with the death penalty, as if the death penalty were some sort of investment. Deterrence The experts of the criminal, and the criminal mind, criminologists, should have the first word in this question. And nearly 90% of criminologists have seen no credible evidence that the death penalty deters crime[2]. Two Quotes: Tomislav Kovandzic, PhD: ""Our results provide no empirical support for the argument that the existence or application of the death penalty deters prospective offenders from committing homicide... Although policymakers and the public can continue to base support for use of the death penalty on retribution, religion, or other justifications, defending its use based solely on its deterrent effect is contrary to the evidence presented here. At a minimum, policymakers should refrain from justifying its use by claiming that it is a deterrent to homicide and should consider less costly, more effective ways of addressing crime.""[2] Jeffery A. Fagan, PhD: ""Recent studies claiming that executions reduce crime... fall apart under close scrutiny. These new studies are fraught with numerous technical and conceptual errors: inappropriate methods of statistical analysis, failures to consider all the relevant factors that drive crime rates, missing data on key variables in key states, the tyranny of a few outlier states and years, weak to non-existent tests of concurrent effects of incarceration, statistical confounding of murder rates with death sentences, failure to consider the general performance of the criminal justice system... and the absence of any direct test of deterrence. These studies fail to reach the demanding standards of social science to make such strong claims... Social scientists have failed to replicate several of these studies, and in some cases have produced contradictory results with the same data, suggesting that the original findings are unstable, unreliable and perhaps inaccurate. This evidence, together with some simple examples and contrasts... suggest that there is little evidence that the death penalty deters crime.""[2] Getting the Wrong Guy Despite the lengthy legal process involved in a death penalty case, there is still the possibility that an innocent man is being sent to his death. Since 1973, 130 people have been exonerated from death row[3], which for them is good, but what does that say about the system? If we had to 'take it back' for 130 people, how many does the system mess up on, and not realize their mistake? And thanks to the fact that no satisfactory evidence has been brought forward to show lives are saved with the death penalty, we can assuredly decide that the death penalty should be abolished because they could kill the wrong guy. A Moral Argument The following is my view, which I shall try to convert you to, if you don't like my opinions on this subject, then at least look at the statistical facts I have presented. I believe that is the height of arrogance to decide that somebody deserves to die. To kill someone solely because you think they deserve it is passing judgment on someone from a completely subjective perspective. The only time you should decide to kill is when it produces a better result that the act of killing. Instead of passing a character assessment, you should only evaluate the benefit for others around you if you killed a person. That is why I am opposed to the death penalty: it has not shown itself to save life, which leaves it as a tool of 'he deserves to die'. That's my moral argument, you don't need to wholly subscribe to it in order to agree with the rest of my arguments. Thanks for reading. Sources: [1] http://www.deathpenalty.org...

death penalty,"Thank you to mongeese for presenting this debate. I look forward to a good one. Resolved: The death penalty should be used at times as punishment for a crime. I affirm the resolution. All rights reserved. First, I will give refutations of my opponent's contentions to the use of the death penalty, then I will argue in direct support of the death penalty. 1. Financial Cost ---------------------- My opponent argues that the cost of death penalty trials and appeals make the death penalty impractical as a punishment in comparison to the lower costs of non-capital trials appeals. On the face of it, this assessment is correct - it does cost more, as evidenced by his source. However, this contention is not with the idea of the death penalty itself, but rather with the expedition of justice in our legal system, and to a lesser extent with the salaries of public counsel, the amount of luxury given to American prisoners, and the amount of rights Americans are at-large are afforded. (The scope of the debate is, I would assume, wider than the consideration of America alone, but this is the most convenient and pertinent example to use, as well as the sole concern of this contention of my opponent.) If justice is to be served, and the purpose of the death penalty (or any other punishment) is to see to that, then financial cost is, first and foremost, irrelevant. This is necessary for there to be any notion of ""justice"" (http://dictionary.reference.com...) to be possible. Suppose A murders B after planning it for five years, and C steals D's wallet. A and C are taken into custody and charged with their respective crimes, capital murder and theft, on the same day. Both are found guilty during their initial trials. For C, justice is relatively swift and uncontroversial - D pays restitution to C and serves a nominal sentence, perhaps six months in jail in addition to a year of probation. For A, justice necessarily requires more time if it is to be administered with proper rights afforded to the accused, as in this case justice requires the ending of a life by the state and thus requires closer scrutiny, which naturally takes longer than considerations regarding imprisonment only. Justice here is what is prescribed by the state as the proper punishment for a crime. In our legal system, the death penalty is a possibility as a punishment for certain crimes. Therefore if justice is the end sought, and the death penalty is the proper punishment for a crime, or justice, then each case must work its way through the system until that end is achieved, regardless of the means. 2. Risk ---------- My opponent here argues that the death penalty is too ""risky"" a form of punishment to be in use, in light of the fact that a person convicted of a crime may be found innocent at some future time, and if they have been executed, they cannot be released. I would respond that if the convict cannot prove their innocence, by whatever means, with the ample amount of time and resources provided to them by the system and evidenced by the contention of cost already mentioned, then they are guilty and thus deserve their punishment. Certainly, the convicted should use DNA evidence - a technology which should help expedite the trial and appeals processes, as this this would cut much of the cost already mentioned. My opponent quotes the ultra-liberal ACLU: ""In the U.S., as of June 2002, 108 people including 12 death row inmates, have been exonerated by use of DNA tests."" First, there were nearly 7,000 people under the death sentence in 2002 [1]. That only 12 had been exonerated by DNA evidence since it began to be more widely used, circa 1986, [2] hardly constitutes ""risk."" Second, if there have been some errors, mistakes in distribution do not necessitate the repeal of the death penalty. Does the fact that 96 people sentenced to other punishments than the death penalty had been exonerated by DNA evidence mean that their respective punishments are too ""risky"" to be in use? Hardly, if ""risky"" means such a high probability of being incorrect that the odds do not favor taking the risk. In that sense, the death penalty is far from risky as well. =============== I have affirmed that the death penalty should, at times, be used as punishment for a crime. As it already is a punishment, the status quo is with me. As the instigator and reformer, my opponent bears the burden of proof. Therefore, let me simply say this. The death penalty should probably not be used as much as it currently is. It does not follow, however, that it should not be used at all. Trials and appeals should be handled more expeditiously if possible; neither is this a reason to not put to death those deserving of such punishment. Some criminals deserve such punishment, and justice requires that they get it; if the criminal deserves the punishment, it would indeed be unjust to punish them in any other form. This in itself is reason enough for the death penalty to be used in certain cases. 1. http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov... 2. http://en.wikipedia.org...",PRO,"Therefore if justice is the end sought, and the death penalty is the proper punishment for a crime, or justice, then each case must work its way through the system until that end is achieved, regardless of the means. ...

death penalty,"First of all, I agree that we must take actions against criminals so that such events do not continue and are not encouraged but I do not believe the death penalty is required in order to achieve such an outcome. Life sentences, I'd argue, Are good ways to punish people who commit such terrible crimes. They remove these people from society, They are more economically efficient and having such a system would allow the reversal of any mistakes made where innocent people are convicted. First of all I'm not entirely sure that murderers are given paroles. Paroles are only given to prisoners who are able to be rehabilitated back into society rather than simply being punished and only punished due to the crime they committed being as vile and as bad as murder. Paroles have to be earned, Prisoners are not entitled to them. Also when prisoners do go out on parole they have to follow strict rules and are sent back to prison if they break them. You mention how if a murderer is given a lifetimes worth of a parole then they will murder again. I don't deny that there are people who find loopholes in the parole system and abuse it to commit another crime, But for one criminals who commit crimes such as murder are very rarely are allowed parole and secondly to what extent this system is abused I do not know so if you have a source on this I would appreciate it. I made the point about deterrence as I often see people who are in favour of the death penalty say that it deters people from crime which I do not believe it does. Like I said in my previous comments, If someone is as messed up in the head that they would commit a crime like murder or something equally as bad then chances are the prospect of death will not phase them. I do not believe the ""fear"" of the death will stop these sorts of people like you claim for the reasons that I have mentioned. On your point though about the death penalty removing such people from society, A life sentence also achieves that outcome and it is more economically efficient on the tax payer and allows for the reversal of mistakes. On your point about costs. I'm sure there is wasteful spending which could be cut in the persecution of people who if punished would receive the death penalty but this is often minor spending and could also be made in the persecution of people who if punished would not receive the death penalty. I have done some research in why the death penalty is expensive which I have linked along with sources to other arguments that I have made down at the bottom and the extra costs that are made when persecuting those facing the death penalty is due to hearings being longer due to more evidence needing to be analysed so mistakes are minimised (and yet mistakes end up getting made anyway which would only be increased if this was cut), Judges having to be hired for longer and extra staff having to be hired by the state such as assistance attorney generals and staff and directors from other departments. These extra costs are all vital and if they were cut to levels the same as persecution of people not being faced the death penalty, Then even more mistakes would be made as they are now. I don't believe that people argue for the death penalty because they want to put a large cost on the tax payer but they often don't realise the extra costs that there are when persecuting people who are facing the death penalty and I don't believe the arguments that these people make are at all comparable to the arguments made by people who oppose legalising marijuana like you claim. I mention the costs of the death penalty as I believe it is a matter worth mentioning when talking about a policy that is not needed in order to have a successful justice system (as we see with European countries like the UK and Germany, A justice system can be successful without the death penalty) and is plagued with all the moral and pragmatic problems that the death penalty has. What changes would you suggest in how the death penalty is executed in order to not only solve all the problems with the death penalty that there are but make it better both morally and pragmatically better than punishing such even crimes with life sentences? You mention how the public are tired with the financial costs of the prison system yet, As mentioned before, The financial costs of the death penalty are far larger than keeping people in prison either to punish them or to rehabilitate them. The death penalty is far more harmful in terms of mistakes that are made and financially wasteful. ""But these matters speak of the materials wasted, Of the few injustices made to the innocent. What of justice itself, By that which society or the wrong feel for those sentenced truthfully for wrongs, For horrors committed? "" first of all I don't think the mistakes made under a system with the death penalty should be simply glossed over as a ""few injustices"" as these mistakes does destroy the lives of many and destroys the faith people have in the justice system. Also the death penalty is not needed in order to have justice, Killing people when one has been killed is not justice its revenge and I'd argue that life sentences punishes people just fine and creates justice for the innocent without the mistakes that destroy innocent people's lives and the unnecessary costs to the tax payer that the death penalty causes. Once again I thank you for debating on this issue with me, And it is really interesting and I thank you for providing such interesting arguments in a really good and respectful manner and I am glad that this is my first proper debate on this website.

death penalty,"Introduction I would first like to thank greatbigworld for accepting this debate. I do, however, want to warn him of something before we begin debating. One specific rule I have implemented states that ""[p]roper spelling and grammar will be used."" My opponent has already broken a crucial rule. I will give my opponent an opportunity to better himself. I will, however, continue doing what I do best: debating. Main Argument I will put aside political affiliation and focus on the facts. Before I begin, however, I would like to state my philosophy: It is not our right to choose who lives and dies. That is fate's duty. My opponent's philosophy is clearly ""kill and be killed."" Granted, when you murder someone, there must be punishments put in place. However, death isn't a punishment. It is an inhumane act. Instead of the death penalty, a suitable punishment would be life in prison. Also, the justice system in the United States is flawed. Often, completely innocent individuals go to prison and sometimes even are put to death. This is injustice. I am a firm believer in the principle of democracy. Deathpenaltyinfo.org states: Support for the death penalty has fallen sharply by 23 percentage points since 1996, reaching its lowest level in almost two decades, according to a recent poll by the Pew Research Center. The 2013 poll also found a 10 point drop in just the last 2 years in respondents who say they ""strongly favor"" the death penalty, from 28% to 18%. The percentage of Americans who say they oppose the death penalty has risen to 37%. In 2011, Pew asked respondents about the reasons behind their views on the death penalty, finding that the top two reasons for opposition to capital punishment were the imperfect nature of the justice system and a belief that the death penalty is immoral. The drop in public support coincides with an overall decline in use of the death penalty during the same time period, with both death sentences and executions falling dramatically since the 1990s. Six states have repealed the death penalty in the last six years, and three governors have recently imposed moratoriums on executions. Don't you believe in democracy? Don't you believe in the fundamental rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness? The death penalty is a direct violation of the rights acknowledged by the Declaration of Independence. If you are at all human, you will understand that all of us have basic rights. If you at all empathize with your fellow members of humankind, you will acknowledge the fact that the death penalty does not serve true justice; it serves injustice. Often, innocent people who have never committed a wrong are put to death because of a mistrial. Can you let this pass? I say no. And even when the person has committed murder or another hideous crime, the death penalty is out of the question. Life in prison is the suitable punishment. I have a challenge for you: refute my points. MLA Citation ""National Polls and Studies.""DPIC.

death penalty,"I want to thank my partner for presenting this debate. Considering the very stern time limits, I will resort to re-using some of my old talking points. Please forgive my lack of creativity. The death penalty cannot be trusted to be inerrant; because it will always be administered by imperfect humans. Humans make mistakes. Among these mistakes cannot be the accidental killing of innocents - brought about by our allowing ourselves to become destabilized by rage. It must be a hard and fast rule that our society and culture do not accept the killing of innocents - even if we are quite certain that we aren't doing so. We are human, and we make mistakes. These mistakes are bound to occur, inevitable, and so we must not apply fallible human understanding to this irreparable and irreversible act. My concern is whether or not maintaining the death penalty is safe to operate – for law abiding citizens who must live nearby such a system. I have shown examples of how it is not. Further, I am not convinced that it can ever be corrected and reformed to offer society the assurance that innocent persons will not suffer death or the loss of loved friends and family as a result of operating the death penalty. I maintain that the failure rate of the death penalty safeguards, if applied to a private company or even an entire industry, would be unacceptable to the public. I argue that rage is the main motivator, the main “selling point” for the death penalty industry – but that this is inadequate to justify allowing it to continue to operate. “I was mad at a serial killer, so I killed your little brother, who did not do anything wrong, but I still want to keep killing serial killers, so I will continue accidentally killing little brothers in order to get revenge on serial killers” is simply not a valid argument. On the other hand, the same argument that suggests that it is unsafe for society to allow serial killers to be paroled due to the possibility that these offenders may kill an innocent person - is exactly my argument against the death penalty: it kills people who do not deserve to die. My argument, therefore: 1. The death penalty is unsafe for the law-abiding public, due to inevitable mistakes made by the penal system 2. The death penalty is irreversible, mistakes cannot be corrected 3. The fact that our society will ineveitably kill innocent persons as we make use of the death penalty is unacceptable",CON,"I argue that rage is the main motivator, the main “selling point” for the death penalty industry – but that this is inadequate to justify allowing it to continue to operate. ... “I was mad at a serial killer, so I killed your",384

google,"Google has been at it for longer-and it shows.Experience plays a significant role in Google's and Microsoft's ability to compete in the search space. Google has spent more than a decade tweaking its search to ensure that it adequately appeals to user desire. Microsoft, on the other hand, has only really been competing earnestly in the search space for a couple years. It was only a few years ago when Microsoft finally woke up and realized that if it doesn't improve its standing in the search market, it could lose its profitability and be kept out of the Web. That lack of experience is showing with Bing. Although the search engine has come a long way in the last year that it has been available, Google, the veteran, is still far ahead. 7. It's Caffeinated Google announced recently that it has moved to a new indexing service, called Caffeine. According to the company, Caffeine offers ""50 percent fresher results for Web searches"" than its last index. That's extremely important. Rather than waiting days, weeks and sometimes months for content to get added to Google's index, it could now take minutes or hours. Not only will that help content providers, it will also improve the experience of searchers who want to find information on some of the news they heard about that day. Bing is still far behind when it comes to indexing speeds. 8. The focus is all wrong The focus of Google and Bing couldn't be any different. Google attempts to find the best solutions to improve its search for users. It realizes that if users are happy, its profits will soar. And its recent financial statements have reflected that success. Microsoft's Bing search engine is much different. For one, Microsoft is focusing too much of its time and energy on what Google is doing. It also believes that the more content available in search results, the more people will like it. Microsoft must eventually realize that search is about users first and foremost if it wants to compete in that market. 9. Mobile integration Google's willingness to bring search to several mobile devices has significantly helped the company stay atop the search market. Google Search is the default service on the company's mobile operating system, Android OS. Even better, it's also the default search engine on the iPhone. In fact, only recently did Apple announce that Bing would also be offered as an option in the company's mobile operating system. Google's mobile integration has been extremely important to the company. Not only does it potentially expose more users to its service, it also keeps current users from trying out Bing. Until Microsoft makes a significant play for search in the mobile market, it will be hard-pressed to catch up to Google. 10. Information takes center stage As mentioned, Bing spends too much time with extras. But Google Search is different. Google's search page reveals everything users need to know about the company's strategy: Simplicity and information must trump all. It works. Although Google is starting to add more features to its search, it's still much simpler than any other service on the Web. Information matters most to Google, and its results-page design reflects that. Google is simply better at search than Bing right now. That doesn't mean Bing isn't worth trying out, but it does mean that from an experience perspective, it has a long way to go to match Google.",PRO,"It was only a few years ago when Microsoft finally woke up and realized that if it doesn't improve its standing in the search market, it could lose its profitability and be kept out of the Web. ...

google,"I'm going to mimic your format so that we have this debate be nice and clean the whole way through. I'm just gonna run down my opponent's list, but what i have noticed is he has strayed far from the topic of what the title states ""google needs to get off youtube."" 1) my opponents first point in its round was a very mixed message to me. essentially to summarize it: yes the comment section is cleaner,but nothings different and things goth better because the youtubers told them to and things didn't get better. of couse I'm very much over simplifying his first contention but essentially he has said that things are better but they aren't and he has no solution for it. my opponent has just kinda written words and sentences to try and stop my argument but he proposes no solution and if his solution is for google to leave: that will do nothing. in fact it will do harm because google OWNS youtube so them leaving will just leave a worse off version of youtube that is primitive and loses money for all the youtubers. esentually my opponent has shed no light on this subject so my argument flows through. 2) google+ intagration. google+, whether you like it or not will never go away unless google sells youtube. google+ is how you sign into google applications. but as i think my opponent agreed he said: ""Google integration is no don't good for organizing and all that, but content creators like me shouldn't be FORCED to integrate our accounts in with Google."" now it sounds like he agreed at some point, but even if he didn't, google+ is unarguably useful. cause even if you don't like it you don't have to customize your page you have the choice to convert out old accounts to google plus, and just don't touch it. but heres the other thing. you SHOULD be force to integrate with google+, because its a google website. if you want to use a google site, sign up for the site like the rest of humans will now and in the future. as for the other changes (i understand that his arguments are out dated) the comment section is far better with new tools like hash tagging, and direct responses by +someone. video responses are back and the comment section has had a lot of cleaning done. so overall the tools are fixed and better as my opponent even agreed with (i think). but when the video responses were gone and the comment section was screwed up google listened to the users and fixed it for them. so now we have an amazing new and shiny youtube that we should all enjoy. looking over this whole contention this cannot be fixed by ""google getting off of youtube"" as the title states. and since this is the argument an my opponent is in the pro. he essentially is off topic. 3) well my opponents ""legitimate"" concerns have all been addressed by me so i guess its up to the voters if google getting off youtube will fix any of my opponent concerns. Next re rebuttal section area thing: 1) well you are right, google has changed things, but you are really under selling it. they made the changes that your mr repzion was complaining about like the video responses and the comment section especially. both of those have changed dramatically. for the better. anon who goes to youtube right now can see that. bob and his silly following (we both agree bob is silly.) is gone for two reasons. 1. google fixed it. 2. they count as spam so google fixed it with their new and improved comment section. also they aren't punishing anyone. they stopped spam, like we've been begging for years to happen. the only thing that has happened is we've been smitten by amazing useful new tools that you can opt to not use. 2) the reason angryjoe and totalbiscuit have these problems is that THEY ARE COPYWRITING. and while i agree that they company should get a percentage for what they use, this is not googles fault. it's the other companies fault. I'm a democrat, so i don't take the side of large corporations often, but google has been humble, understanding, and helpful. this is not their fault. the youtube head quarters are working to fix this as we debate. if you wanted to debate that copy write on youtube should be changed right now you should have specified in the title but this is a debate on google getting off youtube which would solve nothing. as for the disabling of comments, you are right, he dosnt. being a bro myself i watch all of his videos, and he as stopped disabling comments because of the changes google made. pewdiepie no longer has to hide his comments because of the great new comment section. and i love TTT and when i said hot button issues to limit cyberbulling i mean only certain videos on certain channels, like some channels when thy talk about suicide. but basically the rest of your contention proved my point of them not disabling comments cause google fixed the comment section. 3)as for the third contention it is basically the same as the second for i will leave it at that. all in all i will refute my opponents case. but he is completely of topic. the debate is google needs to get off youtube. and they shouldn't as i proved in my first con argument. my contentions are mixed in with my rebuttals so i won't go over them again. all of the issues that my opponent point out are off topic and won't be solved by google getting off youtube.also google OWNS youtube. they aren't just helping hey own the rights to do what they want thats why google+ is there and thats why youtube is so great now. google should not get off they are making youtube a more fun place, which is what youtube is for: fun. thanks for another round. is there a way to shorten it to 3 or 4 rounds though? i think that 5 is a bit much, but thanks again and i can't wait for more debate.",CON,"so now we have an amazing new and shiny youtube that we should all enjoy. ... i think that 5 is a bit much, but thanks again and i can't wait for more debate.",402
google,"im soooo sorry about the ""flowing trough"" its a public forum debate style. basically when somthing is not directely adressed or not to my satisfaction i say that, and so you have to recover from that. the point of the debate is basically for me to incriminate your case. i will stop that if you want though ;p thats also why i adress you as ""my opponent"" its the way i have to debate in tournaments. i promise that the only trait of narcisism/self righteousness i let off is masterbation. lol i will continue to refute each point in ordor my opponent brought it up. 1) so the idea is for google to leave ownership to inturn make youtube better, and my side is to keep google to make youtube better. i understand and correct me if im wrong in the next round. but google has made youtube hundreds of times better. and also made them alot more money. now that google puts on bigger events like the y.t.m.a (youtube music awards) and the rewind youtube 2013. they rake in money to in turn pay for youtubers like totalbuiscuit and angryjoeshow. handing back youtube would cause a drop in money, fireing employees, and much smaller versions of the events i mentioned earlier. but i will get into this again later. 2) googles usefulness is NOT debateable because all it did was add stuff. not take away. if you dont want to use it you dont have to. and it is absolutely part of what we are debating. if google drops youtube then we lose all of the tools like hashtaging and someone. as for the google intagration we seem to agree that its ok, even right (im assuming). but when clients dont like it, they change it. and google has made drastic changes because of user distaste. but they are trying to make somthing like facebook that is always there. google is new and scary, i get it, but this is how the internet has worked forever. somthing new comes and people just get used to it as the product matures. google getting of youtube is not how we fix it. and the reason they have intagration is so that users of other google apps can use youtube easily and startup and join the community. yes this makes money for them, but thats what companys are supposed to do. just cause things arent perfect now dosent mean they are screwing us over. to make money they have to keep us happy and subscribed. so no. they arent giving us the finger, they are trying to help as much as possible. them leaving would be detimental because those that we like: joe and total buisicuit, and shane dawson and joey graceffa would lose money. 3) i dont know why people wouldnt like google. they have the most popular browser: chrome, and they are the most popular search engine: google. the people who dislike google so much that they dont want to use youtube is a miniscule minority. its a dumb hypothetical to pull uneducated voters to my opponent's side. infact the opposite is true. google is so popular that it has added more members and added more users to the new and improved youtube. hey at least its not bing. to continue video respnses are back. they are in a slightly diferent format but raywilliamjohnson gets them for his podcast, runaway thoughts. and the comment section will have to be up to the voters. i just want to point out the new hashtags. the more organized reply system, the ability to turn off replying and likes and dislikes. and the new censorship. the censorship limits spam and hateful comments like never before. of course youtube comments will always be dirty but theere is a huge improvement that will only get better. opponents rebbutals: 1) my opponent stated:bob was not stopped by google. But he was. you can tell because if you post a bob comment it will be flagged and hidden for spam. google had to change their system to fit user's complaints, and in turn stop bob. so thats why the change was not immidiate. 2) now my opponent mis interpreted this argument, and that is my fault. i worded it poorly but this is still not googles fault, in fact giving it back to youtube, would be detrimental because they have less authority and money to fight off these companies trying to claim videos. but more importantly google is not to blame. it is the companies themselves that flag for copyright. google is a very liberal company and has tried their damnedest to be pure, humble, and NOT greedy since the company's foundation. they are not ""stuffing their pockets"". and google getting off youtube sure as hell won't help. and finally. i want to say that this is not because of google its a problem that video game producers who don't do things correctly face. smash games and pew die pie don't face this problem because they have their copyright legality down. joe and total biscuit are obviously doing something wrong. my final focus: my opponent has clarified the debate topic for me so i want to explain why google needs to stay, and why google is important to the website and the community. youtube is not free. the way you pay for youtube is by watching ads. so more views on videos= more money 1) money. google has money. google pays for the big events like the music award i mentioned earlier. this way more views pays for the company to pay for more events and a better more advanced youtube. so they can fix the problems my opponent had addressed. that way we can have more events like geek week and live shows. 2) google has publicity. google can rake in more members by using google+ integration. so people with a gmail or other google applications, have a easy way to join the youtube community and view videos. google has done wonders for youtube, in the event market and by patching and making youtube a better more fun experience. so i urge voters to vote in the con. because in the pro world; youtube is primitive and a smaller community with a lot less money to do fun stuff. while in the con world youtube is a place where users and creators can have fun and make everyone happy.",CON,just cause things arent perfect now dosent mean they are screwing us over. ... while in the con world youtube is a place where users and creators can have fun and make everyone happy.,403

If you look at the image at link [3] you will see an image of a search made on Google images of the word pole, now of course you can imagine that some not so appropriate pictures came up, and if you look you will see that this search was made in moderate safe search. However I then proceeded to do the search under the ""strict"" criteria and still yet some inappropriate came up[4]. I then proceeded to do an image search for ""pole"" on Bing and as you can see in link [6] far less inappropriate images came up. Now as I assume that the first thing you are going to do in response to my position is to argue that I purposely searched a word that would come up with some pictures that you cant quite consider safe.

google,"now im assuming that because this is an oppinion piece my stats have to be limited. however MY CASE: Googles recent changes to youtube are not harmful, dont need to be canceled and are fine the way they are. they should make more changes seeing as google, being a experienced company, knows best in this situation. i will list my contentions and will proceed to refute my opponents case. CONTENTIONS: 1) The comment section has become alot cleaner and much better. now that the censorship has increased, the hate, mean comments, and spam have dramatically decreased. i have seen a cleaner, more fun comment section. which is the goal of youtube, to be fun for everyone . now that the newest changes have made the comment section smoother. Bob and his army has gone away, so now alot of people has jumped ship back to my side. on top of that the new integration of being able to directely someone, using google plus, has made a much more advanced comment section. Also you can hashtag now in comments which is a huge upgrade because now you can enter comment section contests without going all the way to twitter. this is evident in RayWilliamJohnson's video podcasts where if you are going to submit a question they just ask you to #runawaythoughts (name of the podcast). 2) google integration has made thing much easier and much smoother. google intagration is esentually just the new account set up. so for new users, this means that they can just sign up like we did when we started. this also means that you have just one account to sign up for all google applications. i can run everything from gmail, to youtube, to google docs all from one account. i don't even have to sign in on my computer because it has just memorized my google account so when i go to use a new google website, i can completely skip a step! along with the smoother movement of google and youtube comes the previously mentioned hash tagging and someone. 3) This is just another change to a social media/ website which people HATE. they don't hate the change. they hate change its self. this is a huge problem that Facebook faced (no pun intended:) ) when they made changes. every time everyone thought the last version was perfect and without giving the new features a try. the new system has made a lot of things much easier, faster, and much more fun. REBUTTALS: my opponent's first contention: google is ignoring fan criticism. my opponent feels that his or her voice is being ignored. first off, google has made many changes based on fan feed back. they changed the comment section a few times before deciding on this format because of bob and his ""army"". google has been very good about listening to user complaints. however they have reached the point where they feel the comment section and the rest of youtube is much better (which it is). but bob and his army has gotten everyone riled up. this on top of the internets tendency to complain has caused buy opponent to interpret the new youtube as google ""not listening"". at this point google is just waiting for everyone to calm down, look at the new tools, then send constructive criticism. this is not google ""stubbornly refusing"" this is them logically making their website better. the only stubborn ones is the ones who refuse to try to use the new tools and instead just bitch and moan that they miss old youtube. most of this is covered in my 3rd contention. my opponent's second contention: Googles copyright laws incriminates users. google has had some new copyright laws, and for good reason. copyright infringement is no joke. but what has happened to AngryJoe, and Total Biscuit was soon there after fixed, considering google works directly with most youtubers. their ""crippling effects"" are mild inconveniences. as for the other 3 channels who were mentioned. none of them disable comments regularly. many channels disable comments on hot button top topics to limit cyber bullying, which is a different topic completely. my opponents final contention: google is taking money away from users. google is flagging videaos for a reason, so are the companies. it is important that copyright is not infringed, thats why they get taken down. this is not uncommon in media that things have to be flagged for copyright.and as for them ""flagging any video they see"". its not a blind reaping of videos to profit from. this is when a company sees that their content is being illegaly used they flag it. on top of that the no profit thing is a ""no duh"" situation. if they copyright, they deserve to not be paid for it. its not at all greedy, especially since, again, google works directly to fix that exact problem with youtubers. the companies like nintendo for example don't want their content up without permission on other channels, which is legal. in conclusion google has had a positive effect on youtube as a website and a community. google+ has been helpful and made youtube, along with other google apps generally smoother. google+ should stay because its a win for those who use the new tools, those who upload, because they get more publicity, and for google. in the pro world where google leaves youtube. we are left with a primitive version of youtube that companies don't want their ads on in turn causing the uploader to lose money the company to lose money, and those who enjoy the new tools to be left with this downgraded version of youtube. in the end we should try something before we complain we like the old version.

google,"It is my belief that Google, after their company's recent modifications on Youtube, need to just cancel all the changes they have made, and leave it alone from then on. It is causing a lot of problems for most to all of the users of the website. I will list all of the problems I see at the moment. 1.) Google is making changes that most of the users of Youtube have been and are expressing their distaste in. Google has mostly been ignoring every bit of criticizm and stubbornly refuses to change what they have done even when pressed about it. 2.) Google is effectively treating every single user on Youtube like criminals with their recent new copyright changes. Also, their content ID flags are infact crippling larger channels like the AngryJoeShow, TotalBiscuit. Large channels like MinnesotaBurns and Pewdiepie have started turning comments off in their videos along with Nerd Cubed, because of the problems they cause. 3.) And worse, when a video is flagged with one of these content ID flags, the video makes zero profit and it instead goes to the company's who by the way can just go on Youtube and flag any video they see. So it is just the greedy benefit of Google and the company's who do this act that are being the problem to actual, innocent users.

google,"Ok final round. i promise round 5 will be my last response. unless my opponent uses his round 5 for another argument. again i hope you will all forgive my public forum debate style. i would like to use this round as my final focus, to summarize the debate up to this point, and then tell you why it is better, here in the ""con world"", where google does not leave youtube, things are better. but first, a few brief touch ups on the contentions and rebuttals. 1) google staying will lead to more events like the rewinds, the music awards and geek week. this we both seem to agree on. now about companies flagging videos. ITS NOT GOOGLE FAULT. google cannot legally do anything. this is why i keep saying google is trying to fix it. to quote my opponent. ""Businesses flagging videos doesn't even grant youtube money, it grants the business who flagged the video money."" he is absolutely right, youtube/ google doesn't get anything. THEY ARENT DOING IT ON PURPOSE. google doesn't like to just torture their youtube partners. they just have to work around the legality. if google were to leave youtube would have to work around the same problems but they wouldn't have the money an authority that google brings. and with a loss of money that youtube would face, they would have to fire some people at youtube. or they are going to downgrade youtube A LOT. and the drop in money, we agree on this youtube will lose money, I'm not worried about google losing money after they hypothetically leave. and when youtube loses money we get a down graded version of youtube. a much less fun version of youtube. google leaving would cause a loss of money, which means less fun events, less tools and a primitive version of youtube. my opponent said ""And much smaller versions? Eh, just because those are gone doesn't ruin Youtube in the slightest"" essentially saying that won't happen cause it won't, which is a logical fallacy of circular argument. and for the part where my opponent said that youtube can just fix themselves, i will really hit on this point later in the debate. 2) google+ is very useful. the only reason people don't think it is useful is because they still feel angst from the days where bob and his army could run around freely in the comment section. now that, that is fixed the comments are relevant to the video things are un arguably better. its just leftover angst. the comment section has more censoring plus has more tools like hashtaging, +someone, and a comment translator. and best part. if people like my opponent don't like it. just make a regular comment like a regular person. but those of us who strive for a better future for youtube actually use all the tools to make better comments. video responses are still here. but my opponent said somethings are gone. like what? things were only added. as for forced integration, my opponent is just looking at it wrong. its not force integration it is just changing the sign up system so its google+ which is really good for youtube, as i will explain later. drastic change? ramp up censorship in the comments so that bob and his army is gone. youtube should share somethings with Facebook. youtube is a community. so we have to stay connected. Facebook is intagrated into so many things and thats what we want to happen to google+, and in turn bringing new members to youtube. as for the video gamers. they lose money because they don't do things right. pew die pie doesn't have trouble because he does it right. and again, NOT GOOGLES FAULT. blame the actual companies who work around the law. blame the law because it allows it. 3) and i don't care what happens to google. but them leaving youtube would be detimetntal to youtube. thats what I've been getting at. but them staying means that they can use their popularity to make youtube bigger and better. 1) working on it 2) yes their is. look at runaway thoughts on youtube. they use video responses 3) just using that as a rebuttal 4) it is fixed, i.e. bob is gone, spam has decreased, and hateful comments have decreased. and how on earth do you use comments for greed? answer is you can't and it is a dumb point rebuttals 1) well then they greatly helped. i just use bob as my example of spam. but googles new comment section has decreased all forms of spam. also when i say you tuber i am referring to youtube partners. like angry joe and shane Dawson. not regular members. 2)I've addressed this a lot. not googles fault. the only reason it happens now. is that because google bought youtube, companies start to realize the power of youtube. now if google leaves youtube has to fight it off without the money of google. my final FINAL focus: this is the way websites work. for example twitter. twitter is not profitable. buuuuut the company is worth so much that someone can buy it and help twitter out. thats the way things work. websites build an audience, which twitter and youtube have done. now a company buys it and makes it profitable and makes it better. thats how it works, and i get how change is scary, but we need to move forward and accept the good changes that google has brought. i understand the past angs that we have felt because of bob. forced integration, I'm so sorry for all the new tools that you are forced to have the option to use. the only real argument my opponent had was the copyright, and i shut that down time and time again in this debate. its not googles fault. so lets look at the hypothetical pro world and the con world that we are heading into: Pro world: google leaves and youtube loses money. everything down grades, and we no longer have fun events like the music awards and geek week. we have companies running down youtube to no end because youtube doesn't have the authority to fight them off con world (my world and the world we are heading towards if we all just calm down): google integration brings in new members and new revenue. we have plenty of new events like geek week. and most importantly new tools make youtube more fun for everyone. i urge all voters to vote in the con of this debate because google has made youtube better already, and will only continue my opponents arguments have all been shut down and so i just want you to vote based on the fact that google will make youtube more fun, and thats what youtube is made for: fun.",CON,"the comment section has more censoring plus has more tools like hashtaging, +someone, and a comment translator. ... i urge all voters to vote in the con of this debate because google has made youtube better already, and will only",408
google,"""If It isn't broke, don't fix it"". This quote applies to the Google+ update as much as ever. I will reply to your replies, then make some more points. Replies to point 1: If you were one of the 80% who had already had a service from G+ linked to youtube, you would be stuck with it and not unlinkable [2] This is under [1] of how it happens. (Albeit Indirectly). This has caused many problem for people who went to youtube with google+. The problem is not google+, it's the combination that neither side wanted. Google+ people did not want their account associated with the pit of **** that is youtube comments, and youtubers didn't want to have the incredible inconvenience that is Google+. Point 2: As for point number 2, notice the big section below that was not noticed by con. Anyways, moving on. Point 3. Here are multiple help Pages that show this problem, with hundreds of likes. [3] [4] About the ripple effects, we can see the same drop happened with Politico [6], while alternative sites to youtube continue to see increases in users. 4. First off, Many other pictures, albiet hard to locate under the thousands of comments on their official video [5], there has been a wide variety of spam, including swastikas, Pedobear, Hammers and Sicks, NAked women, etc etc, all made possible by this character limit removal. Bob's army is different in the respect that people want it to spread, which is why it is more noticeable. Also note: The official video has has over 32000 comments deleted due to spam and virus links. 5. The point isn't getting to it, it's getting the button to do anything, which as evidenced in the video I cited, doesn't. Also, Comments that are marked as spam are barely viewable, so thumbs up isn't going to do much of anything. 6. If It wasn't broken (Which I contend it wasn't), it doesn't need to be changed. If the Google+ update was worth it, then yes, by all means go ahead and break it. But it wasn't. And the problem still remains. 7 & 8. These inconveniences cause people to either not join, comment negatively, and do not cater to the user, the people who give youtube money. These inconveniences take away from youtube as a whole, and don't give in return. New point #9 GOOGLE+ Phasing out inbox and adding timestamp links With Google Making it near impossible to access your inbox from youtube, as well as opening new links when clicking on a timestamp (Both things which were not that way before the Google+ Update). These things increase loading times, Decrease Efficiency, and ultimately do not serve to help YouTube, but to harm it. Note: I wish I could add this [7], but it's for a separate update. New Point #10 New Methods of Displaying Information are not as good As seen in the point #9, time stamps were not the only thing revamped. The Reply Display, on large amounts, will literally crash your browser [8] [Personal Experience]. Both of these slowed down the process. In addition, hitting(on accident or purpose) A like or Dislike would bring up an closeable box, meaning if you were reading comments, then you would have to reload the page, and start it over COMPLETLEY. New Point #11 Sharing All your moves with google+. If you want to remain unknown with your friends while doing something on youtube, LOLNOPE. All your moves need to be posted to google+. It's like a nagging facebook game, only there isn't a game. That is why I want you all to vote pro. Sources: [1] https://support.google.com... [2] See source 4 of last round.

google,"""They have completely RUINED a great thing. Comments were the number one reason why I checked my YouTube account daily. Now that desire is gone."" This quote, the #1 quote by a user under the name James Gandofini, was the #1 Comment on the Petition to change the comments back to their original form [1]. It is because I agree with many of the Reasons on this petition, and the negatives associated with this update, that I am in affirmation today. Let us start off with the reasons that this update is harmful 1. GOOGLE + MAKES IT INCREDIBLY HARD IN ORDER TO RETAIN an anonymous identity. Co-Founder of Youtube itself Jawed Karim himself Declared: """"Why the f*** do i need a google+ account to comment on a video?"" The fact of it is, Stripping the shelter to hide behind to be unknown if you have a google+ account already that you are forced to use. Note the following: Over 80% of Youtube users had a google+ before the update. [2] 2. The Google+ update Caused many Videos to be lost entirely [3][4] Many users lost content due to a 2-week recovery policy put in by the Google+ update, forcing them to switch. 3. Google+ Has caused Lost Notifications and other problems relating to it. [5] As Evidenced in the 2nd Video, and the comments of [1] and more, Youtube google+ Integration has not only cost convenience as evidenced in the video, but has completely lost some notifications, causing less of the interaction between channel operators and followers, with ripple effects such as lost subscribers and viewers as well as revenue. 4. Changes Regarding Length and links in comments have been removed. [6] For instance, the Link feature used has been taken down due to abuse. If abuse of the system of the update wasn't a harm, I do not know what the word harm means. In the Mean time, People are abusing the removal of the Character limit by posting movie scripts, ASCII art, and other spammy messages [7]. 5. Youtube new moderation Screws with messages with their ""spam"" filter. As seen in the Video above, it was nearly impossible to retrieve perfectly acceptable comments, which could amount to thousands of post of meaningful missing comments, a definite negative side effect, stifling the atmosphere of youtube Comments. 6. The Grandfather Clause means Millions of comments can now not be replied to [8] Simply stated and simple in meaning, no replies to old popular comments, or old comments at all, preventing much intellectual discourse, as well as stifling replies of the old system. 7. Features are not there due to new commenting system 2 Prominent Features of the old System Have been taken out, those being Seeing Info About users by hovering, and seeing both New and Relevant comments at the same time. [1] These features were great for convenience, and them being gone is now a major harm. 8. And Finally, Google+ Makes everything take longer. From Commenting to Sharing To nearly everything on youtube, it is hampered, obstructed, or blocked by the new update. The core that we love is still there, surrounded by the cold hard shell of the Google+ update. It is for these reasons and many more I ask for an Affirmative Vote in todays's Debate. I realize I have more characters, but f*ck it. Sources: [1] http://www.change.org... [2]http://www.cnn.com... [3] http://crave.cnet.co.uk... [4] http://productforums.google.com...

google,"So that we may set the platform for this debate, I would like to ""reword"" the argument statement to -- ""Is the Google Review Rating System good or bad? "" I would also add that, This is not necessarily the statement I agree with, More so what can be inferred from the context of the debate. Do you agree? As I understand it, But feel free to correct me if I am wrong. These are your supporting arguments to the argument statement above. 1) All reviews are 100 percent safe. 2) Guaranteed ranking on your Google business, Maps, And places 3) It""s a significant component of any prosperous marketing campaign. Do you agree? As it is my turn for a statement, I would first like to object to the following. 1) In your statement you are making an assumption that ""All"" is ""safe"". I would say that it is not possible to have all reviews are safe, Because there is no way to guarantee ""safety"". So that we are on the same page, The listed definition of safe is; protected from or not exposed to danger or risk; not likely to be harmed or lost. I would say there is no way to guarantee even the case where it is ""not likely"". Cities are designed to have all the available resources within reach for the populace to survive. These ""Cities"" have a common understanding of the way things need to work in order to ""function"". ""Cities"" have plenty of ""safety"" regulations that are governed by ""law"" which is enforced in order to ""function"". Even then of the countless number of ways that we have tried to guarantee safety through history--we have never been able to. ""Crime"" does exist within the populace and it is the only 100% certainty I see. So my objection to this statement would be, Logic cannot guarantee safety, Because there will always be an object that will purposefully circumvent commands that are expect a specific result to function. This I state as 100% guaranteed. If this is so, And bad and good are the measurement of success and the achievement of 100% is the criteria, Then I would say; The Google Review System is Bad. I would like to end this round with my single objection.",PRO,"As it is my turn for a statement, I would first like to object to the following. ...

google,"Even though the debate is to stop something, my opponent is clearly taking what would be the pro side to this, and therefore I will be arguing that Google+ should stay integrated with YouTube. ""Decrease viewers and subscribers"" How so? Where is your evidence for this? ""bad comment system"" What do you mean by 'bad'? What about it is 'bad'? ""comment spamming"" I fail to see your point here, as the only comment spamming that I have witnessed since the integration of Google+ with YouTube is the ""Bob's Army"" spam that has only some into existence as a protest against the integration [1]. This isn't inherently the fault of Google, but rather certain peoples resistance to change. ""comment links What about the comment links? ""infinite characters"" I fail to see why this is a bad thing. Infinite characters allows a user to write out their entire comment in its entirety without having to write multiple comments in order to accomplish the same task. This is very beneficial if you are in an informal debate with someone on the site, and require a lot of characters to assert your argument. That is why the limits on this site can go as high as 10,000 characters, as people need that much space to write their full rebuttal. ""force G+ account"" It's a free account that does no harm to you. All you have to do is take a few minutes of your life to fill out the form and that is all. Nothing bad about that.

google,"Final round! Let us begin! Remember, at round five, if you choose not to continue, just say ""Conclusion"" in the debate thing that comes up. And make your response to this your final one. Same format as always. 1.) Yes, that is correct. But bear in mind, I believe that keeping them here will cause more problems and sending them away will prevent them. You are correct, however. And if they did rake in money as such to pay them, then why are they allowing businesses to flag any videos they please? Businesses flagging videos doesn't even grant youtube money, it grants the business who flagged the video money. And it wouldn't really cause a firing of anyone really. I doubt Google would fire a bunch of people just because they don't own Youtube anymore. Drop in money? Sure, that'll happen. But hey, so what if they're overflowing pockets aren't that stuffed anymore? They're still going to be rich fat cats. And much smaller versions? Eh, just because those are gone doesn't ruin Youtube in the slightest. And Youtube themselves could make their own version of it later on once they take back ownership. 2.) Google's usefulness is debatable.. Just because they added stuff doesn't mean that people didn't like what they added, which a lot of people like myself didn't. It is debatable to person to person because surprise, humans aren't all the same. Infact, it shows right here that that very statement isn't true. Debating over how useful it is. Just because some stuff isn't taken away (Which there was by the way, video responses) doesn't mean it is automatically good. And yes we do have to use it because it is forced integration. You can't get out of it. It is forced. And we may lose those from Google, but then the people at Youtube who I bet will actually listen to the users will add hash tagging themselves. As for the Google integration? Forced? Wrong. It being forced is a thing that shouldn't be done. It isn't right. Tell me one drastic change they've made. They are trying to make something like facebook? Youtube should NEVER be like Facebook. You see, let me tell you the difference between facebook and youtube. Facebook is a social network for everyone to be able to easily communicate with eachother. Where organizations can get noticed better, and for many other reasons. Youtube is a website determined on storing millions of videos for everyone to watch. A media network. That's the difference and why they shouldn't BE making Youtube be like Facebook if they are trying that. And no, Google is not really new and scary to us, its just sorta lame. And yes, but that's not what we're talking about. Yes, integration is fine. Forced integration is not. And yes, you're right. But they aren't fixing any of the things that we have complained about to them, so if this keeps up, they are screwing us over. Helping us? Come on, during all what they are doing, I have skepticism in that statement. Joey Graceffa and Shane Dawson aren't the ones getting their videos flagged. It's video gamers and video game reviewers and pretty much anyone who does anything with video games who are having their videos flagged. And those who are having their videos flagged? They ARE losing money and their accounts can end up being TERMINATED by this. They already are because of what Google is doing. 3.) I never said that people do not like Google. I am basically saying people do not like their business practices on Youtube. Popularity isn't the case, I think you're missing the point. I didn't put up this debate to try to convince Google going to the ground. I am just saying they need to leave Youtube. And to your entire second paragraph, yes. And I want to point out to the voters these things: 1.) Fail content ID system. 2.) No video responses. 3.)The fact that the ability to turn off likes and dislikes was available before this. 4.) Censorship at its worst, just made off greed. Rebuttal section: 1.) Yes, Bob disappears now because not EVERY Youtuber does it anymore. To say that Google is responsible for getting rid of Bob is to say a player in a Halo game won the whole match just because he got the last kill. Of course they get rid of Bob now, because it is easy to get rid of it when all the users on Youtube are not spamming it. 2.) Your argument is invalid on this one, if Google is withdrawn from Youtube, then so is that system. So businesses can't do it anymore at all. Your third argument in this, the businesses were allowed to do this because Google is letting them. And I'd like to say right here, that you want to know why they don't flag Pewdiepie's or Smosh's videos? Because they have an overwhelming majority of fans and provide money to Youtube and attention. If businesses started flagging their videos, my case would strengthen greatly, and they know that. And AngryJoe and TotalBiscuit aren't doing anything wrong. They have checked rules, given credit, and are not breaking a single one. I challenge you to go and find one rule that they are honestly breaking. And show the proof. One. One rule they break that the companies do not allow. I challenge you. Voters, I won't lie to you. Look at all that Google is doing. They are screwing us over and don't give a damn for the users or content creators out there. On my opponents final focus for number 1, Youtube will be able to do the exact same thing on their own. Because I bet my money that they will listen more than Google is, and do everything that Google did right, and nothing that Google did wrong. Number 2, integration is fine. However, forced integration, is NOT. Do you want to be forced to use your Google+ account for Youtube? I know I don't. I request voters to urge for pro in this, I won't tell you what Youtube will be like but from its like right now and some of my predictions of what will happen if it is handed back to Youtube themselves, its better than what we have right now.",PRO,"It being forced is a thing that shouldn't be done. ...

google,"Four rounds it is, then. Sadly I cannot change the amount of rounds after I post a debate. Sorry for that. At round five, just post ""Conclusion"" if you want it to be done. Anyways... For your first point I would like to point out that no, I was not straying from the topic at all, actually I was getting more in depth into your points as to refute them individually to strengthen my argument,. 1.) This is a debate, and my solution IS Google changing the problems back, leaving ownership, and leaving it behind. And I don't mean to be politically incorrect here if I am being as such but, stop assuming, please. Saying stuff like ""Essentially, my opponent has shed no light on this subject so my argument flows through"" gives the impression you think of yourself as self-righteous. Not a good trait to have. Anyways, yes. But you see, Google did not always own Youtube, they should hand back Youtube to the original owners after they have fixed what they did. 2-3.) Very true on that behalf but it should not have to. And no, I did not agree in the slightest, I was implying. I don't agree with the integration at all. Assumptions. Google+'s usefulness is debatable to person to person but that is not what we are talking about. And you're argument that Google should be able to force its users to integrate? It very much should! That is part of business freedom. But if the users have been actively claiming their distaste in the business practice of forced integration for this long still, they should have enough reasoning to go ""Hey, customers don't like this, we'll change it back."" But, it's simple really. What they are thinking about is not their users, but the money stuffed in their pockets. That, is one of the many reasons why I think this integration is ridiculous. And Youtube used to be just an individual site separate from Google. What if someone doesn't like Google's business and doesn't want to give them money by making a Google account, thus also giving them forced integration on Youtube. People should have the freedom to simply just go on Youtube without Google's changes on it, because clearly people don't like it. And I don't know where you are getting information that video responses are back but so far, I haven't seen it. And the comment system? Still not fixed all of its problems either. Rebuttal Section: 1.) I cannot really see much changes, the problems appear to still be present. You still imply that the bob spam was taken out because of Google. Okay, no that isn't it. Like the Harlem shake, the bob spam died very fast. It's how the Internet guess. Bob had his fifteen minutes of fame for the Internet then just faded away like any other silly or annoying or whatever the Internet liked, went away. Like always. Google had nothing to do with it. And clearly their spam program doesn't work otherwise bob and his army would have been stopped at their doorstep so to speak. 2-3.) And no, they aren't really at all, as I said in the last argument. Do read it again. And yes, it is Google's fault. They gave the company's this permission to leech off youtubers with this new faulty content ID system. Humble? I don't know, that's not really relevant. Understanding? Is that why they have been ignoring criticism? If they were helpful, they would not be reaching out for more money greedily and taking it away from others and like I said, listening to their users. And if you have proof as to them fixing this as we debate right now, I would love to see the proof. And sure, your final argument about sounds reasonable but that has not been happening. Mrrepzion's channel touches on those dark issues now and then and that has not happened to him. Why? Well, we know why. In conclusion, I want to communicate with my opponent that I am not getting off topic. I am defending my opinion by going in depth against your own opinions and showing why they are false or irrelevant. Getting more in depth into the argument rather than getting ""completely off topic"" as you assume. And to anyone reading this, I'll say it again. I believe that Google should just leave Youtube.

google,"There is one powerful tool available on the internet called Google analytics that can be more accurate and effective for analyzing the traffic associated with your sites and there is no doubt that this particular tool having all the powerful abilities and can do clever things like tracking the actions, clients, purpose, etc. without the need of downloading anything at the client’s end but at the same time it has some issues with it. What does it explain us? A recent discovery shows us that a Google analytics (a tool used to analyse the traffic for your site) has the ability to read clicks coming from the Google home application of your mobile device and treating it as the direct traffic. Whenever you asked something or search something useful from the Google home device, it will throw you or respond you back with the related answer, and for doing this thing, it has to be involved in data to find the particular resource. Those type results usually come from information stored on the Google’s indexed web pages. When direct traffic is outsourced The entire relevant search performed by the user or recent visiting history of the user can bring the user to the original resource of this information. Google somehow considering this traffic organic because Google tends to discover the originality of this content as Google home app. However, a deep research shows that a Google is counting this as the direct traffic. Usually, a direct traffic is counted whenever someone either manually enters the URL into the address bar in their browser or when someone enters the unique query in URL. Google can adjust this thing in near future, but for now, we can say that the Google is treating this traffic of Google home app as the direct one. Giving explanation for the direct traffic to clients Whenever you see a direct traffic is rising on the websites, then you will come to know that there are many people out there in the world who may are typing the URL of your site to directly navigate to your home page. There can be many scenarios that could be resulted into the direct traffic for example emails, links from https websites, etc. Problems may occur only in case of miss-categorized results like untagged links from emails that can give a tight sign to your clients that you need to have proper tag links in order to track traffic correctly. Conclusion With the mobile friendly indexing of the web by Google now almost 60 to 70 percent of the searches are coming from the mobile devices so for this to be successful and free from any errors a perfect mobile-friendly approach to counting the direct traffic in the must.

google,"GOOGLE + MAKES IT INCREDIBLY HARD IN ORDER TO RETAIN an anonymous identity."" Firstly, it is on the part of the user that such anonymity remains there, as there is no evidence to suggest that Google makes any attempt to ascertain your true identity. There is just as much capability for a user to lie about their real name whilst making a Google+ account as there is for that same user to reveal their real name when making their YouTube account. Lastly on this point, your note at the end only serves my point. What that 80% represents, is that when the update came out, four out of every five YouTube users already had the main prerequisite for being able to comment on YouTube. ""2. The Google+ update Caused many Videos to be lost entirely"" Source #3 only cites vague issues, without referring to any numbers at all, except for the number ""177"" which was referring to the number of minutes in the movie Braveheart as a user posted the entire script into a comment to prove the infinite characters feature. ""3. Google+ Has caused Lost Notifications and other problems relating to it."" I can say the same thing about this that I did of point #2 in that no numbers are cited, and only a small number of users, as far as I can tell from your sources, actually has this notification issue. Lastly on this point, your asserted ""ripple effects"" are an example of a slippery slope fallacy. ""4. Changes Regarding Length and links in comments have been removed"" Firstly, as you state, the link feature has been taken down due to abuse. That being said, links can still be posted via the description, and by messaging the user, therefore there are still workarounds to this. While I can't deny such use of the character limit, the main content of such ASCII art seems to involve the Bob's Army art, which is in it of itself, a protest to the change [1]. People's abhorrence to the new system is what has caused the spam, not so much people's immaturity. ""5. Youtube new moderation Screws with messages with their ""spam"" filter."" ""Nearly impossible"" is a highly subjective term here, as the person in the video is able to get to the relevant comment in five clicks. I wouldn't personally label five clicks to reply as ""nearly impossible"". Lastly on this point, if the comment was truly something of value, then other users would thumbs it up, putting it at the top of the comment list. ""6. The Grandfather Clause means Millions of comments can now not be replied to"" The breaking of old things tends to happen a lot. Today, for example, was the release of the 0.23 update for Kerbal Space Program. All mods for this game that have yet to be updated, don't work [2]. If we look further back to the 0.21 update, all save files were broken along with all mods, meaning that players would have to start from scratch each time [3]. Such lack of grandfather code is inevitable in many cases like this. That isn't something to hold against it though, as it is most likely something that couldn't be avoided. ""7. Features are not there due to new commenting system"" ""Major harm"" implies that there is something wrong with the system at some fundamental level, whereas in my opinion, and even in your previous sentence, it is just a bit of an inconvenience. This isn't something to get up and protest about. ""8. And Finally, Google+ Makes everything take longer."" Just as in point #7, this is a mere inconvenience, and nothing more.

google,"I love Google and Yahoo. With Google and Yahoo I can search the Internet on any subject that interests me, at any time day or night, in the comfort of my home. I was thinking how much fun it is to learn new things with Google or Yahoo, compared to the boredom or learning torture that public schools put millions of kids through every day. Let's consider the differences in how a typical child (we'll call her Jenny) learns when she uses Google or Yahoo, compared to how she learns in her public- school classroom. First, with Google or Yahoo, Jenny can explore any subject that fascinates her. She literally has the whole world at her fingertips. She can learn about tulips, cooking, dinosaurs, fashion, arithmetic, model airplanes, how to play the piano, or story books by thousands of authors. When she is older, she can search dozens of Internet libraries, including the Library of Congress, for information on any subject under the sun. In contrast, in her public-school classroom, Jenny must study only the subjects the teacher or school principal says she must study, even though these subjects might bore her to death. Second, with Google or Yahoo at home, Jenny can spend as many hours as she wants studying any subject that fascinates her. If she likes flowers, she can spend all day learning about different flowers, how they grow, the best season to plant them, how sunlight helps them, or how much water each flower needs. In contrast, in public school, Jenny usually spends about 50 minutes on each subject the school forces her to study. She has to go to a different class on a different subject every 50 minutes, even if she was interested in the subject she was studying in her previous class. This can strangle her interest in any one subject. For Jenny, public school turns learning into broken, disconnected bits of knowledge on subjects that often bore her. Third, with Google and Yahoo, Jenny learns at her own pace. If she doesn't understand something she reads about, she can ask her Mom or search Google and Yahoo to find the answer. She can spend as much time as she wants with a problem that intrigues her. Because she can learn at her own pace, she feels safe and comfortable learning with Google and Yahoo. In her public-school class, however, Jenny has to learn all the material the teacher gives her in the specific time the teacher allows. Then (in later grades) the teachers will test her. If Jenny didn't like to study the subjects the teacher told her to learn and did bad on her test, she can feel hurt and humiliated. She then associates learning with pain and humiliation. This in turn can extinguish Jenny's joy in learning. With Google and Yahoo, Jenny finds learning a constant joy. With public schools, more often than not, learning becomes a boring drudge or worse. Government-controlled public schools will never give your kids the kind of joyous education they deserve, the kind your children can get in a homeschooling environment. At home, your kids can learn from Google, Yahoo, learning software, or hundreds of other low-cost education resources available to you right now. So how can we Google and Yahoo our children's education? Parents, you might seriously consider taking your children out of public school, permanently. Let your kids once again discover the joy of learning with education alternatives like Google and Yahoo, homeschooling, or low-cost, quality, Internet private schools.

google,"As Google itself argued in 2006 when it first entered the Chinese domestic market; when Google is fully present in China, it can at least do its very best to allow its Chinese users as much access to all the information that Chinese users are allowed to look up. By expanding their access, Google can at least contribute to a broadening of the amount of information Chinese internet users can gather. The alternative is them relying on an even more censored Chinese search engine called Baidu, or having them try to access a heavily blocked, slowed down, restricted and monitored version of Google outside of China, for example google.com or the Hong Kong-based Google.com.hk.

google,"Google’s revenues wont decline because of this Google as a company is still going strong – in the third quarter of 2011, it managed to exceed analysts’ expectations and posted impressive revenue growth. Most importantly, the figures showed that finally the revenue from its mobile and video advertising platform started to come in. This means that the revenue for Google is now starting to come from all over their business portfolio, instead of coming from the search platform alone.[1] This result shows that Google’s revenues won’t sag a bit because of this choice.

google,"Excellent! I'm glad this site is going to get more us out of it because it as a really useful and well-made website for people who just love to debate or plan a future in politics like I do. I'm glad that even debate students like you can start getting into it. Anyways, on to my argument. I'm going to respond to each list of your contentions individually so it is nice and clean. 1.) Yes, admittedly, the comment section is very much cleaner than how it used to be and censorship has supposedly been increased. But on my end, I literally see no difference in mean comments, spam, and hate gone. And I think Bob and his army finally went away because youtubers started to realize how ridiculous and pointless it was to spam the heck out of it, and since I still see a lot of spam, it was clear that Google had no help in it. It was just the users of Youtube that finally got sick of the stupid Bob person, and thank goodness for that. Now, I never said that the comment sections have not had their improvements because they certainly have. But to me, it isn't worth it because the bad is more present than the good in my opinion. 2.) Google integration is no don't good for organizing and all that, but content creators like me shouldn't be FORCED to integrate our accounts in with Google. That should be a choice of the user. Not Google. Because some channels didn't want to be integrated with Google. Check out Mrrepzion's video: http://youtu.be..., mind you some of his points are outdated, but you can check out his other videos on the topic as well. But it does have a couple good points still. 3.) You see, your argument here sounds rational, but you are just basing it off and assumption. I liked facebook's recent changes, they aren't really that bad at all. But you are just basing it off an assumption. I do not like Google's changes for good reason. Legitimate concern. And if you check out youtubers like Mrrepzion, AngryJoeShow and TotalBiscuit have legitimate dislike in Google as well. This isn't just a childish change hating ordeal. This is legitimate concern. Rebuttal Responses: 1.) I do not feel MY voice is being ignored, I feel EVERYONE's voice is being ignored. And yes, they have made changes here and there, but they aren't making changes off things that people are harping upon heavily, just minor changes just so they can tell themselves ""Hey, we changed something!"" And yes, Bob and his stupid 'army' have made a lot of people on Youtube look like children, and it is sad. But they should really be listening to people like Angry Joe and Total Biscuit and people like me who are willing to express their serious concern against them. With actual constructive criticism instead of just spam. They shouldn't punish EVERYONE for a bunch of childish youtubers and should still listen. Because despite the maturity level of the Bob spam, let's be honest. It was caused nonetheless by their changes. I hated the Bob spam though, the users expression of dislike should have been much more rational, but it wasn't. But we can at the very least admit it was caused by the changes. And I'm not ignoring the new tools, I've used them and still do not like them, but can't do anything about it because again, I am forced to be integrated. 2.) Copyright infringement is no joke, but AngryJoe's problems and TotalBiscuits problems are STILL present. Check out their recent videos on the manner and you will see that. And again, AngryJoe and TotalBiscuit, if you watch their videos, will show that these aren't mild inconveniences. And for your last point, they are disabling comments and not on hot button issues. The reason users like Pewdiepie haven't been cancelling his comments is because he has to have a way to communicate with his ""bros."" That's what his ""Friday's with Pewdiepie"" series is all about, and if he blocks the comments regularly, he cannot do that. He has been doing it on some videos however because of this issue. And I personally think that ""ARE YOU JUST GONNA WATCH ME BURN?! - TTT"" is a hot button top topic to limit cyber bullying. 3.) It does sound like they make sense, but the users that are having their videos flagged are completely innocent because all they do is review games, like the AngryJoeShow and TotalBiscuit and show clips of the game in their reviews. They HAVE to, to make their game review backed up with evidence. AngryJoeShow's recent videos have shown that for example his Skyrim review was flagged by not surprisingly Bethesda, the makers of Skyrim because he talked to them about this. It was infact being claimed by the ""Ministry of sound UK."" And the reason for that was because that company had noticed a literal 17 seconds of music that had apparently belonged to them somehow. 17 seconds of a song playing in the background and a small clip like 3 seconds that belonged to them. Which, AngryJoe had no idea who these guys were and I bet noone else did either. This company was clearly flagging his video just to harvest money off that video. Check out his video here for more information and his opinion on it all. http://youtu.be.... The people being flagged are not posting up long winded soundtracks to games or posting up movies or anything. They aren't copyrighting, they have legitimate permission to be allowed to do this because of what they do. In conclusion, that is my statement. And yes, thank you for accepting this debate.

vegan,"Thank you for the great debate topic. Pro's definition of veganism is that of the ethical vegan, which is the orthodox side of veganism. Other types of veganism exist such as dietary veganism, where the reasons for becoming a vegan are more for personal health benefits rather than for the salvation of animals. http://en.wikipedia.org... I would class the dietary vegans in somewhat of a conservative or reformed type of veganism. Some ethical (orthodox) vegans do not like dietary vegans to be called real vegans because they aren't fully converted to the full vegan lifestyle. http://www.theveganwoman.com... You'll see me draw several parallels between veganism and religion in my arguments as I will show that vegansim is very much a type of religion. It's not a religion that touches the subject of God, but its a religion where the orthodox adherents must not waver in their vegan beliefs or actions unless they are to be ridiculed and excommunicated from the community of orthodox vegans. I hold that every person should have the freedom to do what they choose, live the life they want to live, and live with the positive or negative consequences of their decisions. Pro's argument is that ""people should become vegan because it is a better lifestyle, and that way we don't harm or kill animals."" In his argument, con did not specify which lifestyle he is comparing to veganism. I can only assume he meant that becoming a vegan is the best lifestyle over all other lifestyles until he states otherwise. Pro must also define what he means by ""people."" Should all people become vegan? Should a few, some, half, or most people become vegan? Should I become vegan? Should Pro himself become a vegan if he is not already?

I bet if I research some more, I would find alot more animals like these silkworms. My reasons for becoming vegan : 1) Its healthy. Obviously. Here you get to eat more vegetables and fruits. No fat. People wouldn't suffer from cholesterol, diabetes, strokes, and some cancers. Many people wouldn't die from heart problems. 2) Its kind. It is unnecessary to be killing animals in order to feed and clothe ourselves. Plants can keep us alive. Some slaughter houses, are really cruel to animals. http://www.youtube.com... 3) Better for the environment . Meat production uses up alt of land and water. Cows expel amounts of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Their hooves pack the dirt, making it less likely for it to absorb the rain. Manure from animal industrial facilities leaks into waterways, and gets into the groundwater. 4) Its delicious. People from all over the over the world have created plant-based dishes. Many familiar foods have a vegan versions, such as pizza, casserole, even chocolate cake!

vegan,"This debate is about a vegan diet. Vegans are distinct from vegetarians in not eating any fish, dairy, eggs, or animal byproducts, whereas various types of vegetarianism permit some of these things. The resolution is that a vegan diets well-planned by a lay person are healthier than the corresponding non-vegan well-planned diets. A lay person is a person without specialized training or fanatical zeal. There are No Examples of Vegan Populations with Better Health If a vegan diet is healthier than surely Pro would lead off by pointing to some group of vegans somewhere who have better health than the average non-planning meat eater who survives on the typical dietary disasters overloaded with fat, cholesterol, and surplus calories. However, Pro did lead with such data, no where in the debate did he ever point to a single group of vegans with better health than people who eat meat promiscuously. I fully expected that there would be some vegan monks who live forever on soybeans. But no, Pro presented no data on vegans than put them ahead of hamburger gobblers, let alone careful balanced eaters. Broad studies show that the best health is enjoyed by people who have low-meat diets or fish diets. Vegans and those undisciplined meat eaters have the worse health. Vegetarians consuming dairy are somewhere in between in health. Pro made a small error in the saying that vegan data was skewed by having lots on non-smokers in the study group; actually it was the vegetarians who benefited from being non-smokers. Small groups of people adopt particular diets based upon tradition or religious beliefs. With these groups we expect to get closer to ""well-planned"" goals. Again, the big winners were groups having low-meat diets. Okinawans have the longest life expectancy in the world; there diet has fish and small amounts of meat. Vegetarians of the lax varieties do well; vegans are no to be seen in the most healthy populations. Theoretical Nutrition Because Pro has no data showing vegan populations having health better than meat-eaters, he must construct a theoretical argument based upon nutrients that would be in the hypothetical well-planned vegan. Pro points to all vitamins, fiber, and unsaturated fats available to vegans. He shows that there are vegan foods with enough protein and iron to avoid deficiencies. I agree. there are many healthful nutrients in vegetables. Pro points out that supplements are available to augment the Vitamin B12 and Vitamin D shortfalls characteristics of vegan diets. I again agree. It is possible to obtain a healthy diet within the bounds of vegan eating. But being theoretically able to have good health on a vegan diet does not suggest that a vegan diet is healthier than a non-vegan All the vegetables are available to those who also consume meat. At best the vegan diet can be equally healthy. The resolution requires Pro to prove that a vegan diet is not just equal, but superior. In fact, a diet containing almost entirely meat and fish can provide required nutrients. “What the diet of the Far North illustrates, says Harold Draper, a biochemist and expert in Eskimo nutrition, is that there are no essential foods—only essential nutrients. And humans can get those nutrients from diverse and eye-opening sources.” Health Hazards Pro correctly points out that unplanned meat diets tend to have too many calories an too much saturated fat. Well-planned diets with meat do not have too much. Vegan diets tend to have too little protein, vitamin B12, iron, omega-3s, Vitamin D, calcium, and iodine. Careful planning can avoid those shortfalls, but vegans typically do not do the needed planning, so vegan health is typically no better than unplanned meat eating. Since a balanced diet of meat and vegetables has all of the vegetable nutrients, the only way a meat diet can be less healthy is if there is something inherently bad in meat. Cholesterol, saturated fat, and calories are not inherently bad. Planning solves the potential hazards of getting too much. Vegans can get too much saturated fats from oils (coconut, palm, cottonseed), Saturated fats induce the liver to make cholesterol, so there is a cholesterol hazard. Vegans can certainly get too many calories (sugar, french fries, donuts, etc.). That too can be avoided by planning. The only potential inherent harms in meat are cancer risk from processed meats (like ham) or from more than 18 ounces of red meat per week. That's avoided by not eating processed meats, and eating less than 18 ounces of red meat. There is no identified risk from white meat, fish, dairy, or eggs. Hence there is no unavoidable risk in a diet that includes meat. A study by the WCRF claimed a correlation between red meat and cancer above the 18 ounce point. The study was examined by a scientific consulting company, Exponent, and found to be flawed. Pro claimed that Exponent could not be trusted for the sole reason that their results defended the meat industry. If that logic were true, then we should discount forensic evidence for the defense in a criminal trial on the sole grounds the expert is for the defendant. Pro claimed that I had presented nothing that indicated that it was a scientific controversy. What I presented were the very specific scientific objections raised by Exponent. Moreover, WCRF revised their report by publishing an errata in response to the objections. Clearly the objections were scientific. While admitting scientific errors, WCRF refused to modify their conclusions. In the process, they betrayed an anti-meat-industry bias. The burden of proof is upon Pro, and Pro did not respond to the specific scientific objections made. Vegan Diet Planning Making a well-planned balanced diet is not altogether trivial. Meat eaters must avoid too much red meat, too much saturated fat, and must avoid process meats. they must not consume too many calories. Vegans have a much more difficult task. They must make sure they do not consume too many calories or too much saturated-fat vegetable oil. The must also be sure they get enough protein, vitamin B12, iron, omega-3s, Vitamin D, calcium, and iodine. A profession nutritionist recommended that vegetarians track nutrients daily. The planning is greatly complicated by the vegan ground rule of no meat by-products. Pro said that all vegans need do is read the labels on food packages. That is insufficient because labels do not say what is animal based and what is plant based. The reference I gave tells that lecithin and gelatin are animal products. That's not common knowledge. Some vitamin supplements are animal-derived, others are plant-derived and that information is not disclosed. Minor or trace ingredients, like animal-based clarifiers in beer, are not disclosed. Restaurants do not have ingredient labeling. Even with labeled foods, reading every label and researching what is animal-derived is not an everyday task. We know that vegans don't do the needed planning because their health is no better than unplanned meat-eaters. Low-meat balanced diets have little or no problem with planning. A balanced diet is healthiest The American Heart Association, American Institute for Cancer Research, the American Institute for Health, and the World Cancer Research Fund all recommend a low-meat balanced diet for the best health. None recommend a vegan diet and Pro presented no authoritative recommendation for a vegan diet. Pro ignored many of my arguments. He never disputed that the source of nutrients doesn't matter. He didn't dispute that only calories cause obesity. Vegan diet is in practice less healthy, and at best it can only equal a low-meat balanced diet. The resolution is negated. ----- Thanks to Pro for a good topic and a fine debate. I learned much from researching this debate.

vegan,"We""re all busy, Pro. Glad you could make it back to the debate. At this moment, your profile states that you are male, so you""ll want to change that if you want people to refer to you as a female. I""m assuming you believe in the Bible and God since you listed in your profile you are Catholic. ""Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things."" King James Bible (KJB) Genesis 9:3 ""Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils; Forbidding to marry, [and commanding] to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth. For every creature of God [is] good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving: For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer."" KJB 1 Timothy 1,3-5 The above scriptures from a work that many religions around the world deem the word of God proclaims that animals were created for human use and consumption. Timothy also stated that abstaining from meat would be comparable to forbidding to marry or giving heed to seducing spirits. The video you posted did show some gruesome footage. I couldn""t work at a slaughterhouse, and I couldn""t be a surgeon simply because I am disgusted by cutting flesh and blood. The people who do slaughter animals are very important to the rest of us who use animal products for food, clothing, and other products. Regarding the health benefits of a vegan diet, I agree that eating a lot of meat is less healthy than eating a little meat. However, it is true that eating fruits and vegetables alone is not sufficient for the body to get the good Omega 3 fatty acids, vitamin D, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12 it needs. These nutrients are needed to survive as a human, and supplementation is usually needed to get a sufficient amount. http://en.wikipedia.org... Therefore, until recently (when supplementation products were created), people could not really become vegan and get the nutrients they needed. Pro""s second argument about being kind is valid. However, we as humans can enjoy a better quality of life by utilizing animals that share this planet with us. For example the use of down feathers, if well cared for, retain its loft up to three times longer than do most synthetics. http://en.wikipedia.org... Even in an advanced age of technology, products coming from animals are cheaper to produce and can function better than the synthetic replacements. Pro argued that ""meat production uses up a lot of land and water."" ""A lot"" is a very relative term. In fact, I can argue that pro uses a lot of land and water. Use of a resource is good if the outcome brings benefit. Dairies and ranchers raise cows and use the necessary resources so they can sell milk and meat that most people want to buy and use. The value of that outcome really depends on what someone is willing to pay for it. Vegans do not value the animal products, so they will not pay for it. However, restaurants sell plates of seafood and meat anywhere from less than a dollar on into the thousands of dollars. People value animal products, and so the resources used to create the valued productd are not wasted. By saying that cows shouldn""t be raised because they pack the dirt with their hooves simply shows that Pro is a hypocrite unless she can fly. Every time you walk on the grass, you pack it and make it less likely for water to be absorbed. When you build a house and put in a sidewalk, a patio, and a driveway, you are preventing all rain from absorbing into the ground in those locations. The argument about methane is moot as this argument is not about greenhouse gases or what that does. That subject should be argued in a separate topic. There are no sources pointing to manure getting into groundwater and why that might be a problem. I agree that fruits and vegetables are delicious, but so are meat, milk, fish, and poultry. Yes, there are vegan versions of familiar foods, but they are specialty foods, which increases the cost of production. If you want a vegan mayonnaise replacement, it will cost you. If you want a meat replacement, it will cost more than regular meat most of the time. Only when vegan practices become widespread will the market follow suit and be able to produce animal product replacements in higher quantities for the greater discount. If you""re part of a destitute family or in a third world country, veganism is out of the question. Anything that can be consumed will be consumed in those cases. Conflict will be a major part of life for vegans. If family members aren""t all vegans, Thanksgiving dinner, Christmas dinner, going out to eat, and family get-togethers will all include moments of conflict about eating habits. Like I proposed in my earlier argument, veganism is like a religion. The vegan lifestyle will be debated just like religious beliefs are debated in families. For example, a common vegan story is similar to this one: ""Some members of my family had strong objections to me removing dairy products from my diet, believing I""d be socially ostracised. This caused a regular conflict at meal times, especially since I wasn""t cooking my own food for dinner, so whoever was cooking would have to prepare a vegan meal as well as a carnivorous one."" http://rohanmitchell.com... Family is about love, but it""s also about sharing common beliefs and goals. When someone changes a major part of their life so it is not sharable and extra food needs to be prepared for one person, it can become a stage for conflict. Pro has failed to prove her point about why veganism is a better lifestyle than all other eating lifestyles. She failed to provide a second round argument, and she failed to rebut my initial argument about the animosity ethical vegans have toward others who leave their group. There are plenty of reasons why not to go vegan including the extra expenses due to lack of mass production of non-animal products, the religious manner in which ethical vegans conduct themselves and excommunicate the apostates from their group, and the social awkwardness and conflict veganism creates when eating with non-vegan people - especially family.",CON,"Use of a resource is good if the outcome brings benefit. ...

vegan,"Well-Planned Diets are to be Compared The resolution is ""Resolved: Well planned vegan diets are healthier than their meat-based counterparts."" The counterpart to a well-planned vegan diet is a well planned meat-based diet. I take a ""meat-based diet"" to be any diet that includes meat on a regular basis. For example, if a vegan diet is used with some of the protein from beans replaced with protein from fish, then Pro must prove that the departure from strict vegetarianism results in poorer health. I contend that any diet, vegan or non-vegan. that provides all of the nutrients needed, and at the same time avoids excessive amount of unhealthy nutrients will produce the same nutrition-based health. Pro's initial argument, I claim, amounts to saying that a well-planned vegan diet is less healthy than a poorly planned diet with meat. Vegans are extraordinarily health-conscious compared to the average. Why else would a person eschew a great variety of tasty foods in favor of a restricted diet? Okay, sometimes people are vegetarians for religious reasons, but they are nonetheless diet-conscious -- they are not casually consuming whatever tastes good. It should not be surprising that any person who is fanatical about diet or health will end up with better health than one who is not., all other things equal. Comparing the average vegan with the average non-vegan does not support the resolution, since the average non-vegan is not adhering to the ""well-planned diet"" requirement. For example, the longest-lived population in the world are the residents of Okinawa. They do not eat a vegan diet, They eat a balanced diet that includes animal proteins in reasonable quantities along with vegetables. ""Meat, poultry, and eggs account for just 3% of the diet, fish about 11%."" http://www.wellnessletter.com... Okinawans are not typical non-vegans, but they are a good approximation having the ""well-planned"" non-vegan diet. Their health is better than most vegetarian societies. 2. Cholesterol is Fine in Moderation Pro points to cholesterol as a critical dangerous component of meat. Cholesterol is one of those things necessary for health, but harmful in excess. In is something like vitamin D in that the body can manufacture it or it can be obtained from food. Too little Vitamin D causes a deficiency disease, but too much is extremely toxic. A vegetarian can get too much cholesterol from diet. ""... coconut oil may be cholesterol free, but is highly saturated and more dangerous than seafood, as it causes the liver to produce more harmful cholesterol. Saturated fat also raises triglyceride levels and thickens the blood. ... Seafood, on the other hand, contains cholesterol, but also the protective polyunsaturated fats that cause the liver to produce less harmful cholesterol and more protective HDL cholesterol. ... That's why, rather than worry about high cholesterol foods, you should pay attention to foods high in saturated fats."" http://www.all-about-lowering-cholesterol.com... A well-planned vegan diet will avoid that problem, but so will a well-planned non-vegan diet, both by avoiding saturated fats. 3. Obesity is From Calories, not Meat Obesity causes health risks. However, it is certainly the case that some vegans are obese and many non-vegans are not obese. For example, a study showed ""Roman gladiators were overweight vegetarians and not the muscle-bound men portrayed by actors"" http://www.abc.net.au... All that matters is how many calories the person consumes, not whether the calories are plant or animal. ""Obesity is most commonly caused by a combination of excessive dietary calories, lack of physical activity, and genetic susceptibility, '"" http://en.wikipedia.org... Again, it is reasonable that vegans are obese than average people, because vegans are diet conscious, vegetables have lower energy density than meat, and to many people meat tastes better. However, a well-planned non-vegan diet also has the proper amount of calories. 4. Statistics Show No Vegetarian Advantage If there were, as Pro claims, some inherent health problem with non-vegan diets, than vegans should have a consistent health advantage. Even though vegans tend to be health conscious, the statistics show no advantage. A metastudy compiles the data from many studies into one. ""The metastudy reported mortality ratios, where lower numbers indicated fewer deaths, for fish eaters to be 0.82, vegetarians to be 0.84, occasional meat eaters to be 0.84. Regular meat eaters and vegans shared the highest mortality ratio of 1.00. The study reported the numbers of deaths in each category, and expected error ranges for each ratio, and adjustments made to the data. However, the ""lower mortality was due largely to the relatively low prevalence of smoking in these [vegetarian] cohorts."" http://en.wikipedia.org... Other studies of certain selected vegetarian populations show some marginal advantage in life expectancy, but it seems that non-diet factors are responsible, Other factors are not-smoking, higher income and lower stress levels. A National Geographic Study http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com... gives a sense of the factors. Those long-lived Okinawans have low stress and void smoking along with a fish-centric diet. 5. Science Favors a Balanced Diet The National Institutes of Health recommends a balanced diet that includes meat, fish, and dairy. http://www.nlm.nih.gov... A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association Nutrition Committee states: ""...consume a diet rich in vegetables and fruits; choose whole-grain, high-fiber foods; consume fish, especially oily fish, at least twice a week; limit intake of saturated fat to 7% of energy, trans fat to1% of energy, and cholesterol to 300 mg/day by choosing lean meats and vegetable alternatives, fat-free (skim) or low-fat (1% fat) dairy products and minimize intake of partially hydrogenated fats; minimize intake of beverages and foods with added sugars; choose and prepare foods with little or no salt;"" http://circ.ahajournals.org... It might be argued that vegan diets are healthier because it's easier for the average person to make a well-planned diet. It's easier in some ways, because it's likely that vegans will get more fiber and less saturated fat without much extra effort. However, the disadvantages are more than an offset. Vitamin B12 is in virtually all meat, but "" vegans will lack B12 unless they consume B12-containing dietary supplements or B12-fortified foods."" http://en.wikipedia.org... Deficiency of B12 produces pernicious anemia, which s fatal if untreated. ""Vegetarians often have normal hemoglobin, but low iron stores (ferritin) in liver, muscles and bone marrow. Iron absorption is improved by including Vitamin C (75 mg per meal or about 6 oz orange juice) along with an iron supplement (as much as 50 mg per day) and high iron foods."" http://www.dietitian.com... Those who eat little red meat can also have iron deficiency, but the body naturally cravings for red meat when iron is low, so the problem is more easily recognized. ""For the most part, vegetarians get adequate protein if they eat a balanced vegetarian diet. In fact a healthy vegetarian diet usually exceeds protein requirements. ... The best way to make sure you're getting enough nutrients , including protein, is to keep track of the foods you eat on a daily basis."" http://vegetarian.lovetoknow.com... In sum, vegan diets are no healthier than meat-based diets. Both must be ""well-planned.""",CON,"Too little Vitamin D causes a deficiency disease, but too much is extremely toxic. ...

vegan,"Resolved: Well planned vegan diets are healthier than their meat-based counterparts. Terms: Well planned diet: A diet which can be designed by a layperson with a reasonable amount of research Vegan (or plant-based) diet: A diet that excludes animal body parts, animal milk and eggs Healthier: Greater longevity and freedom from disease Meat-based (or animal-based) diet: A diet which regularly consists of animal products (body parts, animal milk and eggs) In this debate, I will argue that plant-based diets are healthier than meat-based diets. I will highlight the virtues of vegan diets and the vices of meat-based diets. My opponent will do the opposite; pointing out the flaws of a vegan diet and arguing in favor of a meat based one. This debate will be based on dietetic evidence obtained from modern, reputable scientific studies. Discussing what evolution ""designed"" us for or what our physiology ""proves"" we should eat can be interesting. However, I would encourage my opponent to base his or her arguments on modern dietetic science as I think this is more relevant to the resolution. During the debate I will point out the role animal-based foods play in cardiovascular disease, cancer, obesity and diabetes. I will respond to criticisms of well planned vegan diets as my opponent provides them. In this round I will begin with cardiovascular disease: World-wide, cardiovascular diseases such as ischemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease end more lives prematurely than anything else[1][2]. In North America, CVD accounts for 40% of all deaths[3]. The American Heart Association estimates that ""79,400,000 American adults (one in three) have one or more types of cardiovascular disease""[4]. Dietary cholesterol is only found in animal foods[5] and is not necessary for humans to consume as it is naturally produced by the liver[6][7]. Scientist estimate that for every 1% increase in cholesterol levels, the risk of heart disease raises by 2-3%[3]. Saturated fats, transfatty acids and dietary cholesterol are the most significant causes of hypercholesterolemia (elevated cholesterol levels)[3]. Of all dietary groups, vegans have the lowest levels of these substances in their blood[3]. Furthermore, the substances that mitigate hypercholesterolemia are soluble fiber, plant protein (especially soy protein), polyunsaturated fats and phytochemicals[3]. These substances are only found in plant foods and are, as a consequence, more abundant in vegans[3]. In summary, vegans have the lowest risk of developing cardiovascular disease; the leading cause of deaths. 1 http://en.wikipedia.org... 2 http://www.who.int... 3 http://books.google.com...

vegan,"Con, being a much more experienced debater than I, has pointed out that the final round of a debate is properly used for summary and analysis. Though I was eager to debate further, and had promised to respond to a couple of things Con had pressed me on, I must decline out of respect for etiquette. I apologize for not structuring my arguments to fit within the first 4 rounds. Summary Beyond the Average Person Con argued that vegan and meat-based diets can both be equally healthy though vegan diets are beyond the average person. I gave scientific evidence proving that vegans (educated and not educated in nutrition) get enough protein and iron. In round 4, Con didn't respond to this evidence. He simply reiterates that average people can't reasonably be expected to plan a vegan diet to meet these needs. I also gave specific example showing B12 and omega-3s were easy to obtain on a vegan diet. His response to this was that vegans must seek out fortified foods (like soymilk) though he doesn't explain why this is any harder than non-vegans seeking animal milk fortified with omega-3s and/or vitamin D. Con quotes a source that said legumes, nuts and seeds don't contain B12 and omega-3s. However, I never said these were sources of B12. Also, this doesn't negate the fact that walnuts and flax seeds are recommended sources of omega-3[1][2]. It just says, in general that legume, nuts and seeds don't contain omega-3s (which is, for the most part, true). Con says that well planned vegan diets are beyond the capacity of average people. By not engaging my arguments on these nutrients adequately, Con shows that he cannot maintain this position under criticism. Furthermore, Con points to foods that have ""hidden"" animal products in them. He doesn't explain, however, why it would be beyond the average person to read nutrition labels and to eventually become cognizant of what foods have animal products. (Note: I was well prepared to argue against Con's points on vitamin D, calcium, zinc and iodine. However, these points weren't raised until round 4 where I was asked to not make any new arguments.) Longevity We've seen that the evidence suggests that vegans and meat eaters, on average, share similar mortality rates. Con points out that vegans tend to not smoke which skews the mortality findings in his favor. I pointed out that vegans, being on average untutored in dietary matters, likely do not obtain enough B12 and omega-3 fatty acids. This observation skews the results of the mortality study in my favor since a well planned vegan diet would ensure adequate amounts of these nutrients. The data collected so far on vegan mortality, though voluminous, is still considered inconclusive[3]. I think as far as mortality goes, Pro and Con will have to agree that all we can say for certain is that, on average, vegans and meat eaters share similar mortality rate. In round 1 I defined health in terms of both longevity and freedom from disease. We seem to be at a draw in terms of longevity, but what about freedom from disease. Disease I've used the very best science available to show that the consumption of meat, eggs and dairy is definitively linked to higher rates of cancer, diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular diseases. Likewise, I have shown that plant-based foods both actively and passively work to lower the risks of these diseases. Cancer, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases are among the leading causes of death (CVD ranks number 1). Given all this, can it be doubted that the vegan diet, as long as it is well planned, will be instrumental in reducing the rates of cancer, diabetes, and CVD. To agree with this is to affirm the resolution. 1 http://www.omega-3-for-your-health.com... 2 http://www.whfoods.com... 3 http://www.veganhealth.org...

vegan,"It Doesn't Matter Whether Essential Nutrients are Plant or Animal Discovery Magazine published The Inuit Paradox: How can people who gorge on fat and rarely see a vegetable be healthier than we are? http://discovermagazine.com...= Inuits are the Eskimos of northern Alaska, Canada, and Greenland, whose diets include very few vegetables. They nonetheless have half the rates of heart disease of typical Canadians and Americans. “What the diet of the Far North illustrates, says Harold Draper, a biochemist and expert in Eskimo nutrition, is that there are no essential foods—only essential nutrients. And humans can get those nutrients from diverse and eye-opening sources.” The Inuits get vitamins, notably vitamin C, from organ meats. The fat from wild animals is largely unsaturated, and the large quantities of omega-3s in their diet helps offset the fats. Raw fish and raw meat have important amino acids that are otherwise obtained from plants. So if your diet is mostly seal blubber and caribou, be sure to balance it with liver and raw fish. The point is that people need certain nutrients, and it doesn't matter whether the nutrients come from plants or animals, or, such as the B12 Pro advocates, from chemical synthesis. A perfectly-planned vegan diet will therefore be no better and no worse than a perfectly-planned diet that contains meat. Both will have all the essential nutrients, and neither will have too much of anything that poses a health risk. I think that Pro wasted a great deal of space in this debate providing lists of nutrients that are found in plants and claiming that nutrients are nutritious. It's true that all those plant nutrients are in plants and that humans need them. All the plant nutrients are available to people who eat both plants and meat, so that is not an advantage of a vegan diet. There is No Inherent Health Risk in Meat Pro offered the possibility that meat posed an inherent cancer risk, so that a diet with meat would be less healthy. However, dairy, eggs, fish, and chicken have no such risk, and red meat poses no such risk if less 18 ounces per week is consumed. Vegans face cancer risks from sugars, fried starches, and refined flour, so their planning problem is not solved by just avoiding meat. The Well-Planned Diet If “well-planned” means “perfectly-planned,” i.e., having all essential nutrients and not too much of anything, and if the average person can accomplish the planning required, then the resolution still fails. The resolution claims that the vegan diet is healthier, and it is no healthier. In the last round of the debate, Pro considered vegan diet planning for protein, vitamin B12, and omega-3s. I have indeed agreed that vegans can get enough protein, and I additionally agree that vegans can get enough B12 and omega-3s. The question is not whether it is possible, but whether the planning is reasonable for the average person. In addition, vegans must plan to ensure they get enough iron, zinc, and additional nutrients. An Australian study showed that using tables of nutrient requirements deign for meat eater is insufficient for vegans: ""Meat, poultry and fish-based meals provide good quantities of vitamin B-12, omega-3 fats, iron and zinc. Legumes, nuts and seeds, on the other hand, do not contain vitamin B-12, important for the normal functioning of the brain, or long-chain omega-3 fats, required for the brain and maintaining a healthy heart. What’s more, the iron and zinc content of a plant-based meal is not as easily absorbed by the body as a meat-based one. ... Professor Katrine Baghurst, key author of the study comments: 'People need to be aware that they should not simply substitute a portion of a plant-based food for a portion of meat and expect to receive the same nutritional benefits.'"" http://www.girl.com.au... Vegans must also plan n order to get enough vitamin D, calcium, and iodine. http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au... Vitamin D is generated in the body upon exposure to sunlight, but that's insufficient in northern climates. The usual source is fortified milk, which most people get ordinarily. Vegans must seek fortified soy milk or some other fortified product. Vitamin D is toxic in large doses, so concentrated supplements are not sold. The advice from a nutritionist to vegetarians is ""The best way to make sure you're getting enough nutrients, including protein, is to keep track of the foods you eat on a daily basis."" How Difficult is Vegan Diet Planning? Vegan has to plan under the constraint that they do not include meat or animal-derived products In the fabled ""land of milk and honey"" both milk and honey are disallowed to vegans. Pork chops are obvious, but there are dozens of so-called ""hidden"" meat products. http://www.cyberparent.com... The list of items to be avoided begins Worcestershire sauce, Caesar salad dressing, pizza topping, Greek salads, packaged cookies and crackers, refried beans, flour tortillas, ready-made pie crusts, bottled juices, colored pasta, some candies, frozen pops, garlic salt, vanilla, meat tenderizers, salad-dressing mixes, ice cream, candy, baked goods, chewing gum, liquor, wine, vinegar, beer, fruit juice, soft drinks, mmarshmallows, yogurt, frosted cereals, gelatin-containing desserts, molded salads ... and continues at length. Life is possible without any of these things (excepting maybe beer, but I assume there is vegan beer made without the animal-derived clarifying agent) but the list of things to be avoided limits where the desired nutrients are allowably obtained by vegans. Since vegans dismiss red meat as too high a cancer risk, they must similarly dismiss tropical oils and fried starches. Pro emphasizes that a vegan diet is naturally lower in cholesterol and calories than an unplanned meat-consuming diet, but the bottom line is that vegans have no better overall health than unconstrained meat-eaters. That tells us that the planning difficulties in areas other than cholesterol and calories are so great as to completely offset those advantages. The healthiest diet actually observed is the low-meat diet. Pro claimed that the planning to keep red meat consumption below 18 ounces. Fast-food franchises, being extremely health conscious, convenient sell red meat in increments called ""quarter-pounders."" This makes tracking trivial. Also, a number of the low-meat diets exclude red meat entirely while consuming some combination of white meat, fish, and dairy. The Resolution is Negated Well-planned vegan or non-vegan diets will be equally nutritious, so the resolution fails. However, it's doubtful that the average person can plan a vegan diet considering all the nutrients that must be given care and the constraints of obtaining them without animal sources. The resolution therefore also fails on the grounds that a non-fanatical layman cannot accomplish the planning to level required. I remind Pro that debate etiquette does not allow adding new arguments in the final round, which is for summarizing and for analyzing the flow of the debate. The reason is that new arguments or data introduced so late cannot be properly debated.

From this study, two things can be said with certainty[4]: * Vegetable and fruit consumption is associated with lower risk of cancer at almost every cancer site[4]. * Meat and animal fats are detrimental[4]. According to the report, vegan dietary components (vegetables, fruits, carotenoids, vitamin c, fiber and whole grains) are the most consistently protective to cancer sites[5]. Meat, animal fat and saturated fats are the most consistently harmful dietary components to 5 cancer sites (stomach, breast, prostate, pancreas, lung) [5]. Fat, grilling/barbecuing and dairy products are the most consistently harmful dietary components to 4 cancer sites (prostate, colon, breast, stomach) [5]. The AICR and WCRF recommendations for cancer risk reduction include: * Adopt a plant-based diet rich with ""vegetables, fruits, whole grains and legumes such as beans.""[6] * Adopt a high-fiber diet containing whole-grain bread and pasta, oats and vegetables and fruits.[6] * Maintain a low body weight[9]. The study's authors point out that plant-based foods have fewer calories and lend themselves well to this goal[6]. * Adopt a plant-based diet to reduce your consumption of energy-dense foods[7]. * Eat no more than 18 oz. (cooked weight) per week of red meats, like beef, pork and lamb, and avoid processed meat such as ham, bacon, salami, hot dogs and sausages[8]. It's clear from the evidence presented above that our very best science on the subject concludes that meat is a major cause of cancer. That same science also makes clear that plant-based foods are consistently protective to cancer sites. Rebuttal Protein Con conceded that vegetarians (though not vegans) get adequate amounts of protein. Could I, the proponent of veganism, really have won the protein argument so quickly and with no effort. I encourage Con to take another shot at this unless he truly does concede that well planned vegans diets provide enough protein. Vegan: Health Fanatics Con claims, without citation, that vegans are health fanatics and he based several arguments on this. Though the vegan diet is the healthiest and most rational to adopt, most become vegan/vegetarian for ethical reasons[28]. Only 29% become vegans/vegetarian for health reasons[28]. Two-thirds of vegan/vegetarians claim to have never obtained information on vegan diets[28]. Many of Con's arguments are spoiled by this demographic evidence. Cholesterol and Saturated Fats Vegetarians can indeed get too much cholesterol though this is irrelevant as the resolution addresses vegans. A vegan consumes no dietary cholesterol and does not need to. There are a hand full of plant sources that are high in saturated fat (coconut oil, cottonseed oil, etc...)[25]. These are rare and a well planned vegan diet would not make these foods routine. Indeed saturated fats are to be minimized in the diet. Vegan diets are very low in saturated fats[26] however meat eaters have a hard time reducing their intake[27]. Mortality The metastudy Con uses shows that vegans and meat-eaters share similar mortality rates while pesca-vegetarian and lacto-ovo vegetarians live the longest. It's clear (and will become clearer) why meat eaters have high mortality rates. So why do vegetarians (pesca- and lacto-ovo-) live longer than vegans? Much can be said against fish, eggs and milk (saturated fats, cholesterol, calories, toxicity[19][20][21]). However, they are good sources of omega-3s[24] and B12[21]. Since, on average, vegans are untutored in dietetics it may be assume that many vegans have not taken measures to obtain enough B12 and omega-3s. Those deficient in B12 are at risk for early mortality, heart disease and stroke[23]. Those with low levels of omega-3s are at greater risk for cancer and CVD[22]. Well planned vegan diet contain adequate amounts of omega-3s and B12; the nutrients that likely cause vegetarians to live longer. B12 Pro says B12 is ""virtually all meat"". However, the true source of B12 is not meat but rather bacteria[12]. Livestock animal are contaminated with B12-producing bacteria they obtain from the soil and manure in their feed[13]. However, B12 does not have to come from unhealthy animal sources. B12 can be extracted directly from the B12-producing bacteria. This B12 is used to fortify breakfast cereals[11], non-dairy beverages[10] and protein bars[14]. One cup[15] of my favorite brand of soy milk contains 100% of an adult's daily requirement of B12[10]. So which is better: B12 from contaminated animals or B12 direct from the bacterial source? When animals absorb B12 it becomes bound to the animal's protein molecules[16][12]. This makes it hard for many people to absorb B12[12][17]. These people develop B12 deficiencies and must consume the more easily absorbed B12 that vegans rely on[18]. The B12 found in fortified, plant-based foods is easily absorbed and is considered reliable[18]. 1 http://books.google.com...

vegan,"Interesting topic ... The Latest Study Shows Meat Does Not Cause Cancer The studies cited by Pro have been superseded by a more recent study: A new study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, however, has refuted that earlier research's claims. After conducting a thorough review of the WCRF's study, scientists Dr. Stewart Truswell, of the University of Sydney, and Dr. Dominik Alexander, of Exponent, concluded that ""there is no conclusive evidence of a causal relationship"" between eating meat and developing cancer"". In the WCRF's defense, Prof. Martin Wiseman, Project Director of the report, said, ""We say explicitly that red meat has important nutritional benefits and do not recommend avoiding it altogether"".http://topnews.us... The recommendations of the AICR and WCRF cited by Pro were not for a vegan diet. Pro incorrectly concluded that if a high-vegetable diet was good, that an all-vegetable diet would be better. WCRF recommended a low-meat diet, but explicitly endorsed meat consumption, saying "" red meat has important nutritional benefits and do not recommend avoiding it altogether."" Whatever risks posed by meat are, according to the study Pro cited, outweighed by the benefits of meat eaten in modest quantities. That's consistent with the Okinawan diet, consumed by the world's longest-lived population. They eat meat in modest quantities and live the longest. Too much is bad, but zero is also bad Consider salt. Increasing amounts of salt produce worse health. However, having no salt is fatal. The same is true of fats, proteins, and, in the extreme, even water. For many things in the diet there is an amount that is optimum for health. That is true for meat. The optimum amount appears to be around that in the Okinawan diet. As I referenced them, that view is endorsed by the National Institute for Health, the American Heart Association, and Pro's cited authority, the World Cancer Research Fund. Pro has not provided a single authoritative source that claims that a vegan diet is better than a low-meat balanced diet. Eating vegetables also causes cancer. Researchers have linked increased use of nitrate fertilisers to an alarming rise in gullet cancer in Britain....'It appears that the mass production of vegetables in the Western world since the last world war may be the underlying factor that has led to such huge increases in this form of cancer,' he added. ... McColl said it was unlikely that organic food would be any healthier, because it also contained substantial levels of nitrate, some of which came from natural fertilisers such as manure. http://www.guardian.co.uk... More generally, the list of foods causing the highest risk of cancer comprises sugar; processed meats; doughnuts, french fries, and other fried starchy foods; and chips, crackers, and cookies. http://www.naturalnews.com... Other than processed meat, all the foods declared most risky are vegan. Vegan planning is beyond the average person I suggested that only health fanaticism would motivate a vegan diet, deducing this from the burdens of diet restrictions. It did not occur to me that refusal to drink milk or catch sardines was ethically motivated. However, Pro cites good evidence, and I accept his argument. It is an ethical belief akin to the religious prohibitions. It is explained as a quasi-religious practice. This explains another troubling piece of data: in the comprehensive metastudy vegans had higher mortality rates than non-strict vegetarians, fish eaters, and occasional meat eaters. The vegans fared no better than those eating unconstrained meat diets. While it is theoretically possible to get enough protein, iron, B12, omega-3 fats, and other nutrients from vegetables, doing so essentially requires a spreadsheet. Recall the nutritionist advice I cited: ""The best way to make sure you're getting enough nutrients , including protein, is to keep track of the foods you eat on a daily basis."" In other words, vegans can get enough protein and other essentials, but often-enough they don't. This is similar to saying that meat-eaters can avoid being overweight by restricting their calories, but they don't. The difference is that vegans fail by lack planning, while meat-eaters fail by lack of will. Pro defined ""well-planned"" as ""A diet which can be designed by a layperson with a reasonable amount of research."" To track protein, iron, B12, saturated-fat induced cholesterol, omega-3s, and all the other stuff on a daily basis requires more research and record keeping than the average layman can sustain, and the solid evidence is that vegans don't do it. I conceded that vegans could get enough protein, and that's true. The problem is that they usually don't. Meat-eaters could restrict their intake of calories and cholesterol, they just usually don't. However, a well-planned balanced diet is within the ability of the average person. It's mainly calories and saturated fats. If the body needs iron, the practitioner of a balanced diet will crave it and is allowed to eat accordingly. Vegans need complex spreadsheets. Vegetarians vs. Vegans Pro asked why vegetarians had better health than vegans, and he conjectured that it was due to getting more B12 and omega-3s. Perhaps, but (see the original quote) the study said it was mostly because their vegetarian sample was dominated by non-smokers. Without the unrelated benefit of not smoking, the healthiest diets were those who ate modest amounts of meat or modest amounts of fish. B12 B12 is produced by the bacteria in dirt, for sure, but its consumed naturally in meat. Pro suggests that the B12 prepared for supplements is less contaminated, but he offers no evidence that ""less contaminated"" B12 provides better health. The human digestive system harbors a menagerie of bacteria, and B12 bacteria are compatible. http://www.vegan-nutritionista.com... Moreover, there is evidence that too much cleanliness contributes to allergies, as the immune system looks for something to attack. http://www.everydayhealth.com... Saturated-fat Vegetable Oils Pro conceded there are unhealthy vegetable oils (coconut, cottonseed, palm, etc.) that induce high cholesterol, but said they are rare. In fact, these oils are common and their use is increasing: ""Palm oil is a common cooking ingredient in the tropical belt of Africa, Southeast Asia and parts of Brazil. Its increasing use in the commercial food industry in other parts of the world is buoyed by its lower cost] and the high oxidative stability (saturation) of the refined product when used for frying."" http://en.wikipedia.org... In the US, they are often in imported products like instant noodles. Pro says that vegans can avoid them. That is another item to be taken into account in the ""well planned vegan diet."" It must go on the spreadsheet for daily monitoring for traces of meat, fish, or dairy poducts; B12; iron; protein; omega-3s; sugar; doughnuts or french fries; and cookies, chips, or crackers. That's too much to tack for any layman who is not a health fanatic, and we have agreed that vegans are not health fanatics. Summary Studies show that people who consume modest amounts of meat or fish have better health than vegans. The National Institute of Health, American Heart Association, and World Cancer Research Fund all recommend a balanced diet that includes meat. The longest-lived populations consume meat. Pro persists in comparing unplanned diets having meat with a theoretically optimum vegan diet. The planning for the idealized vegan diet is beyond the average person.",CON,"http://www.naturalnews.com... Other than processed meat, all the foods declared most risky are vegan. ...

vegan,"We are getting into the meat of this debate. Things are sizzling. A Low-Meat Diet is Best for Health My claims at the end of the last round have gone unrebutted. Studies show that people who consume modest amounts of meat or fish have better health than vegans. The National Institute of Health, American Heart Association, and World Cancer Research Fund all recommend a balanced diet that includes meat. The longest-lived populations consume meat. Pro persists in comparing unplanned diets having meat with a theoretically optimum vegan diet. The planning for the idealized vegan diet is beyond the average person. Also, comprehensive studies show that in practice vegans have no better health than indiscriminate meat-eaters, and that the best health is achieved by those with low-meat and low-fish diets. Vegetarians who consume dairy are somewhere in between in overall heath. Pro responds that he will get to the planning issue in the next round, but indicated no intention to dispute the rest. The Cancer Study Controversy Pro's Case is Negated if the Study is Accurate. Suppose the WCRF/AID study is 100% correct. Pro's case is still negated, because the Study did not recommend the vegan diet that Pro advocates. They recommended a low-meat diet. The American Institute for Cancer Research summarizes, ""Studies show we can eat up to 18 ounces a week of red meat without raising cancer risk. Research on processed meat [preserved by smoking, curing or salting] shows cancer risk starts to increase with any portion."" http://www.aicr.org... A vegan diet also extrudes white meat, fish, and dairy not subject to the claimed risks. The dispute is about whether there is proved causal relationship between meat consumption and cancer above the 18 ounce threshold. It's About the Science, not the Authors The review of the WCRF/AID study was done by Exponent. Exponent is an independent organization of 900 professionals. Their website http://www.exponent.com... notes ""Our multidisciplinary organization of scientists, physicians, engineers, and regulatory consultants performs in-depth investigations in more than 90 technical disciplines. We analyze failures and accidents to determine their causes and to understand how to prevent them. We evaluate complex human health and environmental issues to find cost-effective solutions."" Their reputation depends upon their integrity. Pro objects that Exponent was paid by the Cattlemen's Association. Suppose you are accused of a crime, and you believe that you can be proved innocent by showing that someone else's DNA was at the crime scene. What you do is hire an independent forensic expert to investigate and report. That's what the Cattlemen did. It plays out in Court by each side presenting the evidence they uncovered. Arguing that the defendant paid for his defense does not dispose of the evidence, the evidence must be examined directly. If the hired expert finds nothing, the defense fails. In Pro's ref R3.14, a professor summarizes the Exponent findings: The report omitted a comparison of several groups of socially matched meat-eating consumers and vegetarians in which there was no difference in mortality from colorectal cancer between the two groups; The WCRF/AICR report omitted 13 cohort studies involving 1.6 million people -- including a large study conducted by the American Cancer Society -- in which 11 of the studies found no significant association between eating red meat and cancer; The report did not refer to follow-up work by certain of its research sources that drew different conclusions, and The report did not refer to recent work by researchers that involved more subjects and reached different conclusions. The full Exponent report is on the US Department of Agriculture web site. According to R3.14, the results of the exponent study were discussed non-confrontationally with WCRF/AID who agreed to make revisions. Pro objected that the website I cited reporting the Exponent study was inadequately qualified. Pro's R3.14 has the same info, plus more detail. At some point, WCRF complained that they couldn't comment because the report had not been published and was not publish. However, WCRF was soon given a copy of the report and it was published on the USDA website. That makes who made the initial summary irrelevant. WCRF/AID ultimately responded by making corrections to their report, posted at http://www.dietandcancerreport.org... While they admitted errors, they said that the errors did not substantially change their conclusions. Exponent did not back off. Keep in mind that the WCRF/AID study was a metastudy. Neither WCRF/AID or Exponent generated the underlying data, both are analyzing data collected by others. In WCRF's fervent denial of having made significant errors (Pro's ref R3.16) they show bias, saying ""Our 2009 Report on public policy implications of our recommendations also points out that current industrial methods for meat production are very wasteful of scarce energy and natural resources such as water and diverts grain needed for human consumption into animal feed."" They are assuming that conserving resources is more important than meat production. That's an anti-meat public policy agenda. (In the US, 40% of the corn crop goes to making ethanol, a value system that places fuel over food.) WCRF's bias does not negate their report. As with Exponent, their work stands on it's own. I think there is a good case that processed meat poses cancer risk. The risk for fresh meat above 18 ounces per week is in doubt, but since the most healthful diets are low-meat, it's not important for the present debate. A properly-planned diet with meat limits quantities and avoids processed meats, just as a properly-planned vegan diet avoids tropical oils, fried starches, and other things. Obesity, etc. Pro establishes that obesity is bad for health. We are comparing properly planned diets, and a properly-planned low-meat diet avoids overeating. I pointed this out in R1, and Pro has not responded. The planning for that is easy; the realization is more difficult because meat tastes good. Both the planning and the realization of a vegan diet are much more difficult. Iron Pro persists in comparing an unplanned meat diet with a perfectly-planned and executed vegan diet. The data shows that in practice vegans have no better health than indiscriminate meat eaters. It's important to understand why vegans fair so poorly, despite vegans having an easier time of reducing calories. The answer is that vegans have trouble maintaining the required intake of protein, iron, B12, and other nutrients. That relates to our debate because Pro must prove that the vegan diet can be correctly planned by an average person. B12 Pro claims that the B12-producing bacteria in animals are contaminants. I claim that the B12 bacteria are compatible with the human digestive system, which is loaded with bacteria. Pro has presented no data showing harm from consuming B12-producing bacteria is harmful. I presented data that avoiding supposed contamination too rigorously may lead to allergies and asthma. The resolution is negated.",CON,Their reputation depends upon their integrity. ... The resolution is negated.,444
vegan,"So far I've given the evidence showing that animal-based foods cause CVD, cancer and diabetes. In this round I will highlight the virtues of plant-based foods. As usual my rebuttals will follow. I will provide the authoritative sources advocating vegan diets in round 5 instead of here due to space constraints. I will also address Con's claim, that a modest amounts of meat is better than no meat, in round 5. Plant-based Foods When animal-based foods are excluded from the diet, there is more room on the plate for plant-based foods. Plant-based foods are high in fiber[1], contain no dietary cholesterol[2] and are low in saturated fats[3]. Fiber (which animal-based foods lack[1]) lowers cholesterol levels, improves blood sugar control, reduces the risk of gastrointestinal disorders, aids in weight loss, and normalizes bowel movements.[1] Phytochemicals Phytochemicals are substances found exclusively in plant foods which confer a protective influence on us[4]. A diet which derives more of its calories from plant-based foods will necessarily have more phytochemicals. Where animal-based diets cause cancer and cardiovascular disease, the phytochemicals in plants actually work to counter the risk of these diseases. The following will be a detailed look at phytochemicals in various types of vegetable and their antioxidant, anticancer, anti-CVD, antiviral and antibacterial properties. Cruciferous vegetables (i.e. broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage) have[9]: * Indoles and isothiocyanates (anti-cancer) Umbelliferous vegetables such as celery, carrots and parsnips have[9]: * Coumarins (anti-CVD) * Flavones (antioxidant, anticancer, anti-CVD) * Carotenoids (antioxidant, anticancer, immune-enhancing effects) * Phthalides and polyacetylenes (anti-tumor) Allium vegetables like garlic, onions, leeks, etc... have[9]: * Allicin (anti-CVD, antiviral, antibacterial, anticancer) * Ajoenes (anti-thrombotic) * Vinyldithiins (antiasthmatic, antithrombotic) * Allyl sulfides (anticancer, anti-CVD) Citrus fruits have[9]: * Flavonoids (anticancer, anti-CVD) * D-limonene (anti-CVD, carotenoids) Grapes and their juice have[9]: * Flavonols (anticancer, anti-CVD) * Anthocyanins (strong antioxidant) * Resveratrol (antioxidant, anti-clotting, anticancer, anti-inflammatory) Berries have[9]: * Anthocyanins (strong antioxidant) * Flavonols (anticancer, anti-CVD) * Phenolic acid (antioxidant, anticancer) Whole grains have[9]: * Phenolic acid (antioxidant, anticancer) * Lignans (a possible anticancer agent) * Phytates and tocotrienols (antioxidant) Legumes have[9]: * Isoflavones (antiestrogenic, antioxidant) * Lignans and phytates Nuts and seeds have[9]: * Flavononols, phenolic acid, lignans and phytic acids (anticancer) and tocotrienals Rebuttal Vegans Need Spreadsheets Despite my pleas, I could not get Con to argue that vegans can't get enough protein in their diet. Con is wise in not pursuing this. Despite popular misconceptions, the plant kingdom is abundant in high quality sources of protein and vegans can, with ease, obtain all of the essential amino acids in adequate quantities[5]. This includes vegan athletes who often require 3-4 times the amount of protein recommended for non-athletes[5]. I contend that vegans are at no disadvantage with regard to protein though I concede that poorly planned vegan diets may be low in B12 or omega-3. So far, I think it is fair to say that Con and I are in agreement. Con wants to argue, though, that a well planned vegan diet is beyond the average person because spreadsheets would be required to keep track of B12, iron, protein and omega-3 intake. Research shows that there is no significant difference in the intake of iron between vegans and meat-eaters[6]. Also, on average, vegans meet dietary recommendations for protein[10][11]. So this leave us with the question: How can a vegan get enough B12 and omega-3s? As I stated earlier, a cup a fortified soy milk provide a daily allowance of B12. Daily consumption of fortified soy milk, modest amounts of flax seed and walnuts will meet recommendations for omega-3[7][8]. As you can see, it is extremely easy for vegans to obtain what they need on a diet that has been well planned. Is it so easy for meat eaters though? The meat eater has to always be on guard against exceeding the 18oz. (cooked weight) weekly limit of red meat or else they will be at a greater risk for cancer? How can meat eaters know for sure how much cholesterol and saturated fats they've consumed on any given day (substances which lead to greater risk of CVD and that are virtually absent in a vegan diet)? Is it not hard for meat eaters to calculate the fiber they are consuming to ensure adequate intake? Could it not be argued that a spreadsheet would be required for all of this? WCRF Cancer Study Controversy Con wasn't able to prove the review to be anything more than a controversy between science and industry. B12 I didn't say the B12 producing bacteria are contaminated. I said livestock animals are contaminated/infested with B12 producing bacteria. My argument was that B12, when bound to animal protein, is harder to absorb than B12 extracted directly from the bacterial source. (Protein bonds are difficult to break). B12, extracted directly from bacteria, is used to fortify foods and is better than protein bound B12 because it is easier to absorb. 1 http://www.mayoclinic.com... 2 http://findarticles.com... 3 http://www.livestrong.com... 4 http://www.phytochemicals.info... 5 http://www.adajournal.org... 6 http://www.ajcn.org... 7 http://silksoymilk.com... 8 http://www.vrg.org... 9 http://books.google.com...

vegan,"I thank my opponent for accepting this debate I hope that my opponent and myself can learn much about the ethics and practical reasons for choosing a low carbohydrate diet over a vegan diet. As per the structure of the debate, it is not my obligation this round to refute my opponent's case. I will of course address his argument in the third round. I am clarifying this so that my opponent cannot accuse me of dropping his argument. I will now formally present my own case against the veganism. The Argument from Healthy Choices Clearly this argument needs justification from me as many people argue that vegan diets are the healthiest method on which one might conduct their life. You see the argument from a low carbohydrate diet is that we can use fat to fuel our body for nutrients. The problem is that many are using the Lipid hypothesis to justify their assertions for arguing that meat is unhealthy and that furthermore vegan diets(because plants contain no fat) are much healthier. Here is my argument in deductive form: P1) A low carbohydrate diet is more healthy than a vegan diet Subpoint A. A Vegan diet promotes many deficiencies Subpoint B. A Vegan diet causes negative effects Subpoint C. The lipid hypothesis is false. P2) We should do what is healthier for our body. C1) We should adopt a low carbohydrate diet. As you can see, the conclusion naturally flows from the premises. P1) A low carbohydrate diet is more healthy than a vegan diet Subpoint A. A vegan diet has been shown from many studies to promote low levels of many different nutrients. The most notable nutrients of these are vitamin B-12, omega 3 fatty acids, and iron. For B-12, studies has shown that serum levels are always low in vegans[1]. Furthermore, because of their B-12 deficiency they have low HDL(good cholesterol), elevated homocystetine and lipoprotein(a) levels[2]. Regarding omega fatty acids, studies have also shown that plasma EPA and DHA are lower in vegetarians and vegans regardless of duration of adherence to the diet[3]. Studies have also shown Omega 6:3 is higher in vegan children[4]. When we move onto iron I think you will find the results are quite similar, not only is the RDA for iron 1.8 times the levels for meat eaters(due to heme iron from meat being more bioavailable)[5][6], many vegan foods contain polyphenols and phytates that can decrease the absorption of nonheme iron(i.e. Spinach, lentils, wheat germ, etc)[7]. There is evidence for deficiencies in many more nutrients including: Vitamin A, Vitamin K2, Iodine, Coenzyme Q10, Taurine, Carntine, Vitamin D and Calcium. I can provide studies if needed for any of these nutrients at my opponent's request, but I think the audience get the main argument that Vegans suffer from many different deficiencies and low levels of nutrients vital to surviving. Subpoint B. A vegan diet not only promotes deficiencies it has negative physical effects on the body. I will be going over many aspects of negative factors on veganism including low testosterone, increased disease risk, and negative child development effects. The first point I would like to make is that vegetarians and vegans both suffer from lower levels of testosterone[8][9] and sperm count[10]. Not only that but there has been a case report that there is a loss of libido and erectile dysfunction on a soy-rich vegan-style diet[11]. When it comes to increased disease risks, you can look no further than veganism! Not only do vegan diets cause reduced gallbladder emptying [12], but they can lead to Alzheimer's disease[13], and cardiovascular mortality[14]. It also increases your chance for heart disease by decreasing HDL(cited above but I will provide another study)[15]. Child development has many studies on the negative effects of veganism, this includes B-12 deficiencies[16], lower birth weight and earlier labor[17], and tend not to grow normally[18]. Subpoint C. My last point is the lipid hypothesis is false. Technically, my opponent has burden to prove that lipid hypothesis is correct however because many accept the lipid hypothesis without question I will argue against it here. The lipid hypothesis is simply put is the theory that fat is what cause heart disease and cholesterol increases. It also states that cholesterol in of itself causes heart disease. However, this hypothesis is false in everyone of its links. For one, even very recently the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics have conceded that from the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee's Scientific Report, we can eat red meat as part of a healthy diet[19]. Furthermore, saturated fat(a constant in animal products) has been shown to have no correlation with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease or coronary heart disease[20][21]. P2) We should do what is healthier for our body. My second premise is that we should do what is healthier for our body. While I don't believe this premise will be contested, I will argue it anyway. I would like to remind the audience that the implied premise for this premise is within moral reason. Which means that ethical considerations still apply. However, we should note that we have an ethical responsibility for self-preservation. It would not be immoral, for example, to kill someone who broke into your home and was attempting to kill you. The point I am trying to make here is that ethics always must take practical concerns into account. We must remember that our own self-preservation is a very high moral ethic to abide by and must go above most other values. C1)We should adopt a low carbohydrate diet. If the premises are true then the conclusion naturally follows. The Argument for the Permissablity This argument revolves around what degree that animals have rights and what degree they are sentient. Now equality must exist in some respect as animals do have some level consciousness yet we know that this is degreed because we do not afford the same rights to some who kills a cockroach as to someone who kills dog. Likewise we do not afford similar punishments to someone who kills a dog to who kills a human. Here is my argument in deductive form. P1)If animals are not morally equivalent to humans, then it is okay to eat them. P2) Animals are not morally equivalent to humans. C1) It is okay to eat animals. As you can see, if the premises are true then the conclusion naturally follows. P1) If animals are not morally equivalent to humans, then it is okay to eat them. Now if we assume that animals are not morally equivalent to humans does that mean we have right to eat them? I would argue it is so. For example, we do not argue that lions ought to be converted to veganism. Neither do we say that a cat is committing a moral atrocity by killing the mice in our house. We know that it is in their nature, and even if they did have a moral obligation to not kill animals outside their species they don't have the capacity to comprehend said morals and cannot be seen as responsible for making that moral mistakes. We can further see this when we consider the argument above, because a low carbohydrate diet is healthier(physiologically) than a vegan diet, this implies there exists a need for animal products to satisfy the health requirements of human beings. If our body needs it, and animals are not equivalent to humans then it must be okay to eat them. P2) Animals are not morally equivalent to humans. Animals cannot participate in human culture, and they cannot live ethically by nature of their own capacity. Moral theory not only considers everyone's equality but it also considers practical concerns and because animals are not moral beings by nature, it would seem to be illogical to argue that animals can have the same rights and responsibilities as humans. No one would argue that animals have this capacity. I would like to point out that its the human's responsibility to prevent unnecessary suffering not the animals moral right not experience it. That's why we get up set when we see animal abuse, because we know its unneccesary not because the animals have had their rights violated. C1) It is okay to eat animals. I will pass the argument onto my opponent and I would like to thank him in advance for this debate!

vegan,"My apologies, I guess ""better"" was too vague. Thanks for accepting the debate in-spite of that. I hope this will be a very fun debate. Opening ================ I believe that an omnivore life-style is more beneficial than a vegan life-style. I hear many people say this, and I have a very strong belief on the Con side. I will provide arguments and rebut my opponent's to further support my point. Arguments ================ 1. Nature A lot of people say that eating animals is wrong and immoral, this is incorrect. Herbivores have molars to easily chew vegetables, and carnivores have K-9 teeth (the pointy teeth, for those of you who don't know what that means) to help tear meat. Us humans, have them both. Why? Because we were meant to eat meat AND vegetables, not one or the other. This is nothing new to Earth and other animals share this trait, which leads me to my next argument. 2. Food Chain Again, people say that eating animals is immoral and wrong. I have an example of where it's perfectly ok; the wilderness. Animals eat other animals all the time. In fact, some animals only eat OTHER animals (carnivores). So humans eating meat is nothing new to nature. 3. Nutrition While a vegan diet has a slightly better nutritional value, a meat eating easily gives you protein. Yes, there are ways to get protein in vegan diets, but meat is superior when it comes to protein. If you have any desire to exercise and work out, you know that you can recover faster if you consume protein afterwards. Protein builds muscle. Athletes also eat meat, sure, it's controlled, but they still eat it. According to source [1] ""A 100 gram portion (3.5 ounces) of raw ground beef contains large amounts of Vitamin B12, B3 (Niacin), B6, Iron, Zinc, Selenium and plenty of other vitamins and minerals,"" obviously meat has a lot of nutritional value 4. Taste Let's face it, meat is one of the tastiest part of the meal. Vegetables and fruits can't really live up to meat's taste. Wouldn't people like to eat something that taste good? If you had to only eat vegetables, meal time wouldn't be so good. Yes, there are some tricks to make vegetables taste better, but meat tops it all. Rebuttals ================== Oh geez, I'm going to sound so mean. First of all, I would like to say one argument here. Most of Pro's arguments are arguing that a vegan SOCIETY is better. We are talking about the individual here. If one were to switch to a vegan diet it wouldn't stop the meat industry. All the arguments about ""Veganism is better for the environment"" or ""Veganism is a Superior Alternative To Fighting World Hunger"" are not relevant to this debate. One person isn't going to stop the meat industry, so most of Pro's arguments are useless. 1. Veganism is kinder toward animals Okay, here we go. This sounds a bit mean, but it's true. The animals we raise in farms or in plantations are meant to be food, would you all rather of back to hunting for food? We may not have a successful hunt and we may starve. Sure, if you eat vegan you aren't eating the animals, but the animals is still on the shelf, useless. Isn't it meaner if you just leave the sacrifice of an animal un-used? That means that the animal died for nothing, and the meat will just rot and become useless. Sounds mean. 2. Veganism is better for the environment Again, one person isn't going to miraculously stop the meat industry. There will still be animals production. This argument doesn't explains why it's better for the individual to switch to a vegan diet. 3. Veganism is a superior alternative to fight world hunger There will still be livestock... One person isn't going to change it. 4. A well planned vegan diet is healthy While yes, vegetables are healthy for you. However, if you aren't a vegan you still eat vegetables and fruits, so you will get the nutrients you need from those foods. The only difference is that you have good tasting food and a great source of protein with an omnivore diet.

vegan,"I will go line by line for the rebuttal, then extend my first argument First my opponent gives a definition of absolutism but fails to explain why it is best for this round. Where's your warrant? Then my opponents assumes I think the meat industry would be eliminated overnight, however my supporting evidence is specific to things like GDP and why the vegetarian and vegan industry would NOT be able to replace it. You have to disprove this warrant in order to gain ground because if there is no other SUSTAINABLE alternative to food production in the status quo, adopting radical veganism does more harm than good. In counter to environmental claims, here is a good article about the misconceptions of meat industry environmental harms, and justification to its use in diets. https://www.theguardian.com... Then my opponent claims that meat would be outlawed when vegans were the majority. This is incorrect for several reasons. First, there are many real world examples of bad things that are in the minority and still legal such as cigarettes, dog meat, and duck meat. According to an article published in the last two years ( http://inhabitat.com... ) it is still legal in 6 states to eat cat and dog meat, meaning a federal ban of meat coming from cows and chickens is highly unlikely even in a pre dominantly vegan world. Then my opponent makes to claims 1) that my impact and warrant don't match. This is not true, the reason humanity could not survive a vegan diet in this example had nothing to do with the health debate but the sustainability debate which I can't seem to get my opponent to answer directly. This article is excellent on this debate (https://gpfarmblog.wordpress.com... ) and explains why things like the amount of healthy land able to be used is not sufficient and will not become sufficient, and all plant diet would use too much water to sustain the earth and itself, and many plants would not survive growing in industrial conditions which are the only conditions that would be able to produce enough in the first place. A worldwide vegan diet is unsustainable, end of story. Then my opponent says that the developing countries impact doesn't make sense and that I am agreeing the world should become vegan. These are both incorrect. First, the exclusion of second and third world countries from the pro contention means the pro can never solve which, on the most fundamental level possible, is the point I was trying to make. Second, I am saying that the entire world WOULD HAVE TO become vegan to make any real change, but not that it SHOULD. That is why I am Con in this debate. Then my opponent says their authors are credible and mine would have to be vegan to be credible. First of all your authors are not credible. You applied their philosophy to prove people should be vegan, but they themselves weren't meaning obviously they did not feel the need to apply there own philosophy in the way you are doing as the pro. Second, my authors would actually have to be meat eaters to be credible because a) most of them are writing from medical and moral standpoints and b) they must practice what they preach to be credible. Finally my opponent addresses humane washing. I'd like to start off answering this by offering this article : https://medium.com... (morality debate) . It gives empirical evidence as to how a vegan world would actually be a world more cruel to animals. The warrants are very long and I don't have enough characters to elaborate on them. I would also like to point out that my opponent has turned an argument they made on their own case into a reason to vote against them and that is this: logically, if meat is outlawed like a drug, prostitution, etc people would react violently and meat eating would become a violent merciless trade. Ever heard the expression ""laws are meant to be broken"" ? On to extensions: Extend all my health claims in round 1 including the counter claim I made at the very end. here are a couple of credible articles to contribute to the health debate: http://www.thehealthyhomeeconomist.com... http://articles.mercola.com... (health factor) Next extend source 5 from the last round which disproves some environmental claims my opponent made and actually gives environmental incentive to keep the meat industry. Next extend my ethics argument. My opponent has failed to disprove that ethics are solely a human concept . This is critical for the debate because applying justice to animals serves no purpose if animals themselves cannot recognize it as justice. It is simply self serving for the pro. Next extend my economy argument at the top of my con case. Any risk of damaging the meat industry's GDP, even with gradual transition, means you vote neg because it is still the biggest impact in this round. Finally, and I'm only doing this because it has happened to me before, I'd like to clarify the next round is for rebuttals only. No new evidence should be submitted unless it follows a line of argumentation already established and does not make any new claims. If you accidentally make a new claim or something it should be disregarded but I won't be someone who claims to win the round because of it, since that does no good.",CON,"Finally, and I'm only doing this because it has happened to me before, I'd like to clarify the next round is for rebuttals only. ...

The Cummunist Manifesto “Let the guzzling classes tremble at a Cummunist revolution. The harlotarians have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to win. Working men of all countries, unite!” –Karl “Big Gulp” Marx The vegan ethos is motivated by the recognition that neither man nor beast may be made an object to be sucked dry by the ruling classes. Vegans see ethical worth in all sentient beings and so refuse to partake in the reification of animals. Meat and leather represent the coercive transformation of a sentient being into an object to be sold and consumed. Swallowing semen is consensual act- the sperm is willingly expelled from the body with joy and vigor. Barring fringe cases of prostitution, the vegan is not making the sperm donor an object to be bought and sold; the vegan is not reducing the sentient spewer to a piece of meat. Simply put, spunk ain’t a commodity. Oral sex and the eager lapping that follows is not only wholly within the ethical bounds of veganism, it solves the inequalities vegans object to. In his semenal work, Marx noted: “In proportion as the exploitation of one individual by another is put an end to, the exploitation of one nation by another will also be put an end to. In proportion as the antagonism between classes within the nation vanishes, the hostility of one nation to another will come to an end.” Swallowing is an act which bridges the divide between classes. It removes antagonism as the donor appreciates the moral fortitude of the vegan for finishing the job through to the end.",CON,"Definitions: Veganismis the practice of abstaining from the use of animal products, particularly in diet, as well as following an associated philosophy that rejects the commodity status of sentient animals ",449
vegan,"I accept. In Pro's resolution, ""We should move towards a world where everybody is vegan,"" I find it necessary to define the term ""should"" so that the implications of the resolution are more clear. [1] *Using this definition of the term ""should"", the resolution claims that everyone in the world is obligated to become vegan. Since this is a positive statement, burden of proof lies with Pro. I shall present my arguments: Contentions: C1. Human Rights - Human Rights were created by the United Nations to have a global understanding of how to treat individuals. Fundamentally, it implies that human beings are free to do whatever they wish as long as they do not violate human rights. Of course this is not completely true, as individual nations have their own separate laws outside of the 30 Human Rights. However, since every nation has different laws, the only way to account for every human being in the world is through Human Rights, which is acknowledged globally. [2] --> Therefore, fundamentally, people are free to do what they wish as long as they don't violate the 30 Human Rights established by the United Nations. Their only obligation is to follow the Human Rights. And since not being a vegan does not violate any Human Rights, they are not obligated to become vegans. C2. Personal Preference and Right to Choose - There are many people in the world who don't want to be vegan. Why ""should"" they be something they don't want to? C3. Food is Not a Luxury (in many cases) - There are many people who cannot afford to be picky with their food and choose to be vegan. What if your in an emergency and you need to eat something or you'll die? I have a teacher who went camping once and got lost in the woods for 2 weeks and had to survive on squirrels and birds because there was nothing else to eat and many of the plants were poisonous. ""Should"" he have been a vegan then and died? C4. Food Reduction - Let's say there is x amount of food available in the world, and y amount of meat and vegan not-approved foods in the world. Should we adopt a worldwide vegan system, the amount of food available to us would be x - y. That means there will be less food available for mankind because we don't eat meat. This is tied to the previous contention. C5. Economic Crisis - Fundamentally, an economy is fueled by entrepreneurship and the buying and selling of products. Many products in the market are not vegan-approved, such as dairy products or anything with the slightest bit of meat in it. - If the world adopted a vegan system, many products would either be banned or not consumed. Many people would lose their jobs. - Take McDonald's for example. [3] McDonald's is a huge multi-million dollar corporation that provides food with meat in it. There are approximately 1,800,000 people working for McDonald's. If everyone was vegan, McDonald's would shut down and 1,800,000 people would lose their jobs. - And McDonald's is only one out of several mega-corporations that will shut down, resulting any many people losing their jobs. Every fast food franchise, every dairy company, they all get shut down. Rebuttals: ""we would be better off from a selfish point of view."" - From a selfish point of view, we would be better off not enforcing our own beliefs and (eating) habits upon others. There are people who don't want to be vegans. It would be selfish to want others to eat the same way you do, assuming you are vegan, even when they don't want to. ""But also, that it is in my view, its the only moral option for us."" - I request Pro explain this claim. How is this the only moral option for mankind? As explained in my last contention, millions of people would lose their jobs. Is it moral to lose them of their jobs and destroy the economy just so that everyone can be vegan?

vegan,"Outline I. Intro II. Animal suffering ethics III. Environment IV. Health V. Conclusion VI. Sources I. Intro Thanks for accepting this debate. I will be arguing that every adult in first world countries should be vegan. Exceptions, rare medical conditions, extraordinary circumstances, and lab grown meat. [0] Examples of extraordinary circumstances would be stuck on a desert island or in an elevator shaft. There are three main points to my argument, animal suffering & ethics, environment issues, and health concerns. As a responsible adult and productive member of society I feel it is necessary to take care of one's health, the environment, and to show compassion for animals. II. Animal suffering ethics First and foremost is animal suffering and ethics. Claim 0: There is no survival need to eat animal products. Warrant 0: ""Typically, vegans can avoid nutritional problems if appropriate food choices are made. Their health status appears to be at least as good as other vegetarians, such as lactoovovegetarians.""[1] Impact: Any suffering via the raising, transportation, and breeding of livestock can be seen as animal cruelty. Vegan is the morally superior path. Claim 1: Animals suffer greatly during factory farming. Warrant 1: Common knowledge. Impact 1: When combined with the fact that we don't need to eat meat to survive and the abundance of wealth in 1st world countries, factory farming has no relevant difference than dog fighting, pig wrestling, pigeon shooting, and cock fighting. We are simply eating meat for pleasure at the cost of great suffering and pain to animals. This is animal cruelty. Halt a large portion of animal cruelty by becoming vegan. Claim 2: Humans have drawn an arbitrary line between animals and humans. Warrant 2: Richard Dawkins a famous person known for his intellect says so. [2] Impact 2: This is a cruel double standard. Such a double standard is an injustice. ""Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere."" [3] Martin Luther King, Jr. As long as such an injustice is allowed to stand, a threat to justice everywhere remains. Become vegan today to help remedy this injustice. Claim 3: Cage-free, free range, pasture raised, and their variants are a form of humane washing. Warrant 3: ""the movement to treat farm animals better is based on the idea that it is wrong to subject them to unnecessary harm; yet, killing animals we have no need to eat constitutes the ultimate act of unnecessary harm."" [4] Impact 3: While factory farming is common knowledge humane washing is not. Not only does humane washing have the injustice of animal cruelty but of deliberate deceit to the public. Adults in 1st world countries should become vegan thus boycotting such products. III. Environment If you paid attention in elementary level science class you learned about the food chain, autotrophs, heterotrophs, and tropic levels. That each trophic level requires significantly higher amount of biomass and thus energy. Therefore, it is logical to eat at a lower level in the food chain, plants instead of animals. Cows require up to sixteen pounds of grain to produce one pound of beef. Then, there is destructive fishing habits, rain forest deforestation to clear land for cows, and so forth. IV. Health I think it is immoral to carelessly destroy your health and leech off of the various forms of welfare and public assistance. I ideally a person should repay his or her society and become an industrious citizen. There are many health benefits from becoming vegan with little health concerns. The benefits including receiving plenty of the good while avoiding the bad. The good being antioxidants, fiber and phytonutrients. The bad being excess fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, heterocyclic amines, endotoxins, and IGF-1. V. Conclusion The first world is plagued by immoral and morbidly obese humans leeching off not only their own nations but destroying the environment for everyone. We can no longer afford to allow these evil humans to desecrate our morals and future. They will hide behind their religions and selfish ideologies, nevertheless we cannot afford to be infinitely patient. For justice, the environment, and your health become vegan today. All adults in first world countries barring a few exception should become vegan as soon as possible. Thank you for reading and thank you for the debate. VI.

vegan,"Rebuttal, I will go line by line and rebut my opponent's arguments. My opponent's arguments will be in bold and italics, mine will be plain text. ""Con thesis: The pro thesis is absolutist and not every adult living in a first world country should be Vegan."" marymcnamara First, as in my round one argument there is some exceptions rare medical conditions, extraordinary circumstances, and lab grown meat. [0] Second, when it comes to justice, an absolutist attitude is often best. ""2. An absolute doctrine, principle, or standard."" [5] We should use an absolute standard or principle. Animal cruelty is never justified. I stand firmly behind my absolute principle of abolishing all forms of animal cruelty. ""Claim: The meat industry is extremely valuable to the world's economy"" marymcnamara ""Impact: Following the warrant, eliminating the meat industry is not economically viable and would result in severe economic consequences."" marymcnamara Agreed with claim and warrant, disagree with impact. You assume everyone would simply become vegan overnight. This is highly improbable. People are resistant to change. Instead, I find it much more probable that slowly more and more people would become vegan until meat eaters were in the minority. At that point a law would most likely be passed outlawing meat production. Due to the mostly gradual change people would simply change vocations. There is no shortage of help wanted signs in my area. Justice is a higher priority than economy. ""Claim: Humanity in present day could not survive a worldwide vegetarian/vegan diet"" marymcnamara ""Impact: An unsustainable food/vegan farming system to replace the old one. No change in sustainability."" marymcnamara Your claim and impact don't match. You claim we couldn't survive on a worldwide vegetarian diet, give a long quote and then use a completely different impact. As for the warrant, which I didn't copy and paste due to character length restrictions, there is a lot of factors to take in. Overall, plant based diets win enviormentally. [6][7][8] ""Claim: Developing Countries rates of meat consumption are rapidly rising"" marymcnamara ""Impact: there are multiple warrants within this argument and therefore multiple impacts. The first is that developing countries have seen a major rise in meat production and will therefore offset benefits to eliminating meat industries in the united states. The second is that farmers in developing countries continue to produce more without regards to the environment and health, leaving countries that have eliminated the meat industry unable to help them for moral and political reasons. On the flip side, if they did help developing countries eliminate their meat industries, the global economy would be tanked (no warrant, see first claim). The third warrant is that the meat industries in these countries will continue to grow despite drawbacks, meaning developing countries then have a moral obligation to assist them in order to preserve their populations and the environment, which turns the pro impacts."" marymcnamara The claim is correct, yet this is about 1st world countries. I take issue with the impact again. ""The first is that developing countries have seen a major rise in meat production and will therefore offset benefits to eliminating meat industries in the united states. "" marymcnamara Eliminating injustices in the 1st world helps justice overall. The fact that meat production in developing countries will cause environmental damage is irrelevant to this debate. You seem to be making an argument that the entire world should become vegan, which would include first world countries, if so you are agreeing with me. ""The second is that farmers in developing countries continue to produce more without regards to the environment and health, leaving countries that have eliminated the meat industry unable to help them for moral and political reasons."" marymcnamara You make an argument that the entire world should become vegan, thus agreeing with me. ""On the flip side, if they did help developing countries eliminate their meat industries, the global economy would be tanked (no warrant, see first claim). "" marymcnamara Again, gradual change as seen with my rebuttal to your first claim. "" The third warrant is that the meat industries in these countries will continue to grow despite drawbacks, meaning developing countries then have a moral obligation to assist them in order to preserve their populations and the environment, which turns the pro impacts."" marymcnamara An argument for everyone to become vegan. ""Ethics- Rights are unique to human beings rights only have meaning within a moral community only human beings live in a moral community adult mammals don't understand or practice living according to a moral code the differences in the way human beings and adult mammals experience the world are morally relevant therefore rights is a uniquely human concept and only applies to human beings (4)"" marymcnamara Animals already have some rights. There are plenty of anti-animal cruelty laws. See what happens if you commit one of these acts in public. This argument also falls apart when dealing with the mentally challenged. An insane person can't be accountable for his or her actions, yet also has certain rights. Animals are sentient and can feel pain. ""AND No impact to ethics, it's mere philosophical speculation Arbitrary Lines- concede this claim, it has no link to the argument, neither King nor Dawkins practiced veganism and are not credible sources. The evidence was shifted to try to favor pro's argument and should therefore be dropped in the debate."" Mary You are the one with philosophical speculation. How are MLK and Dawkins not credible sources? Just because someone isn't vegan, doesn't discredit them intellectually. Also, are the authors of all the links you provided vegan? By your train of thought we should discredit them if they aren't. About 2000 characters left going to quote you less. ""Humane Washing- http://www.qmscotland.co.uk...... This link gives multiple reasons as to why meat is good for humans, meaning that there is a reason behind killing animals (to eat) and is therefore not an ""unnecessary harm"""" Mary Yes, meat can provide substance and is better than starving, yet we can receive all those nutrients on a vegan diet, especially with fortified foods and supplements. You seem to miss the entire point of humane washing. Animals are still often mistreated. There will always be the conflict of interest between animal welfare and the profit motive. There will always be studies that contradict each other. Yet, this is how science works. Some studies will find a strong correlation between cholesterol and heart disease and others will find none. Overwhelmingly the answer is becoming clear that vegetarians have an advantage over meat eaters. Remember the meat industry is huge and has lots of money to influence results. As for the environment see these links. [6][7][8] If you use pasture raise animals you need a lot of acreage thus deforestation. Factory farming requires massive amounts of water and grain. Fishing is incredibly destructive. Vegan is clearly the environmentally superior choice. Thanks for the debate I look forward to next round.

vegan,"Thanks again Con for your participation in this debate. I will open with the link between meat, obesity and diabetes. In my rebuttal, I will address Con's critique of the WCRF/AICR cancer study. I will also address Con's comments on iron and B12. In round 4 I will show that vegans can be healthy without spreadsheets. I will also provide authoritative source which advocate vegan diets, as Con requested, in round 4. Diabetes and Obesity The seventh leading causes of death in the United States is diabetes[1]. Diabetes is itself a contributing factor to heart disease and stroke[2]. People eating vegan diets have a one-half reduction in the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes[8]. There are several reasons this may be the case. Vegans have: less obesity [2][4] lower intake of saturated fat[2] higher intake of fiber (especially soluble fiber)[2] higher intake of magnesium[2] higher intake of unrefined foods with low glycemic index[4] Excessive body weight is the most important risk factor for Type 2 diabetes[2]. Vegans, on average, have lower body mass index when compared with meat eaters[4]. Almost a third of the adults in the United States are obese[3]. About 15% of American youths are overweight while another 15% are at risk of becoming overweight[5]. In addition to an increased risk of diabetes, obesity carries with it other problems such as: Sleep apnea, pseudotumor cerebri, and Blount's disease[6] Hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and abnormal glucose tolerance[6] Obesity negatively affects adolescent socialization[6] The medical costs of obesity are estimated to be about 70 billion dollars a year[7] A reduced risk for diabetes and obesity powerfully supports the view that a vegan diet is healthier. Rebuttal Cancer Study The ""latest study"" Con cites (I will refer to it as a ""review"") on the link between cancer and meat seems to be more controversy than science. According to feedstuffsfoodlink.com, The National Cattlemen's Beef Assn (NCBA) commissioned Exponent Health Sciences (Dr. Dominik Alexander) to review the important findings of the WCRF and AICR cancer metastudy[14]. Predictably, Dr. Alexander's findings turned out to be favorable to the interests of the meat industry. The WCRF and the AICR vehemently dispute Drs. Alexander's and Truswell's review. They claim that the meat industry (specifically the National Beef Association (NBA), the National Sheep Association (NSA) and the National Farmers) ""[mislead] the public by making factually inaccurate and potentially defamatory comments""[15][16]. WCRF says of the review: ""WCRF is not aware of any such review. It is aware of Dr Truswell publishing a letter in the AJCN, which was printed with an accompanying letter from WCRF responding to his points. Dr Alexander published a review of the evidence on whether animal fats and animal proteins affect cancer risk. But this is not the same as a review of the link between meat and cancer as much animal fat and protein is dairy. WCRF is aware he has conducted a review of the evidence on the link between meat and cancer, but because this has not been published it is not in the public domain and so cannot be commented on.""[15] I was not able to find a reputable news outlet that published any article on this review. I attribute this to the consideration that consumers of news are interested in actual health information; not in the inconsequential disputes between science and industry. The citation Con gives for this was an article on a website called ""topnews.us"". I was not able to find any information regarding the authority of this site. The website has no Wikipedia page which is unheard of for a news outlet. This may imply that the Wikipedia editorship concluded that topnews.us does not meet with its guidelines for notability (http://en.wikipedia.org...). The topnews.us article on this review did not mention the controversy. It might be thought that topnews.us were simply unaware of the controversy but this is not the case. In the article, they quote the WCRF press release to make it appear as if the WCRF were sympathetic to the review's findings: ""In the WCRF's defense, Prof. Martin Wiseman, Project Director of the report, said, 'We say explicitly that red meat has important nutritional benefits and do not recommend avoiding it altogether'"". The WCRF was actually responding to accusations the meat industry made against the WCRF which claimed they were on an ""anti-meat crusade"". Consider what was left out of the quote: ""The implication that we are somehow a tool of the anti-meat lobby is ludicrous. We say explicitly that red meat has important nutritional benefits and we do not recommend avoiding it altogether.""[15] Con's source, for some reason, tried to conceal the controversy. This topnews.us citation cannot be considered a reliable source. Furthermore, the review can't be said to have undermined the metastudy at all. I encourage the reader to examine the sources I gave for this information as it provides an interesting behind-the-scenes look at how the meat lobby works toward controlling scientific knowledge and public opinion. Iron In round 1 Con claimed that vegetarians had low stores of ferritine iron in their body. The citation Con used made it clear that this is the case for *some* vegetarians - particularly those who simply do not consume enough iron in their diet. This criticism is not relevant to the resolution since it doesn't concern a well planned vegan diet. As Con noted, vitamin C plays a key role in the absorption of iron[9]. Citric acids (found in citrus fruits) and fruit sugars (fructose) also enhance absorption[10][11]. Since vegan diets are high in these components it is easier for vegans to absorb iron. The iron found in red meat (heme) has been shown to damage the lining of the colon[12]. The vegetable world is replete with non-heme iron. Rich sources of iron include: lentils, beans, leaf vegetables, tofu, chickpeas, and black-eyed peas[13]. B12 I need to clarify what I had said about B12 in round 2. Livestock animals are contaminated with B12 producing bacteria. This is to say that they are infested with bacteria that produce B12. This does not imply that the B12 is contaminated.

vegan,"Round 3 my opponent's arguments will be in bold and italics and mine in plain text. ""I will go line by line for the rebuttal, then extend my first argument First my opponent gives a definition of absolutism but fails to explain why it is best for this round. Where's your warrant?"" Mary I already explained that animal cruelty is never justified. That is my warrant. ""Then my opponents assumes I think the meat industry would be eliminated overnight, however my supporting evidence is specific to things like GDP and why the vegetarian and vegan industry would NOT be able to replace it. You have to disprove this warrant in order to gain ground because if there is no other SUSTAINABLE alternative to food production in the status quo, adopting radical veganism does more harm than good. In counter to environmental claims, here is a good article about the misconceptions of meat industry environmental harms, and justification to its use in diets. "" Mary This is a little confusing, you seem to imply that veganism is not environmentally sustainable in addition to the economic penalty. First, justice is more important than economy. As I've stated before its unjust to slaughter animals. Mainly because its unnecessary. I've read your link about Fairlie and it confirms the current agribusiness is inefficient. Then, goes on to talk about pigs eating parts of grains that would be composted. This is unconvincing, first composting replenishes the soil. It is not like the part of the grain that isn't used just disappears. Second, there's no figures to compare from credible sources. ""Then my opponent claims that meat would be outlawed when vegans were the majority. This is incorrect for several reasons. First, there are many real world examples of bad things that are in the minority and still legal such as cigarettes, dog meat, and duck meat. According to an article published in the last two years ( http://inhabitat.com...... ) it is still legal in 6 states to eat cat and dog meat, meaning a federal ban of meat coming from cows and chickens is highly unlikely even in a pre dominantly vegan world."" Mary Let's not get too sidetracked. We can speculate all we want about the future, but I don't think this is getting us anywhere. ""Then my opponent makes to claims 1) that my impact and warrant don't match. This is not true, the reason humanity could not survive a vegan diet in this example had nothing to do with the health debate but the sustainability debate which I can't seem to get my opponent to answer directly. This article is excellent on this debate (https://gpfarmblog.wordpress.com...... ) and explains why things like the amount of healthy land able to be used is not sufficient and will not become sufficient, and all plant diet would use too much water to sustain the earth and itself, and many plants would not survive growing in industrial conditions which are the only conditions that would be able to produce enough in the first place. A worldwide vegan diet is unsustainable, end of story."" Mary Well first and foremost, this debate is about 1st world countries adults. Which is not a worldwide vegan diet. I didn't read though your entire warrant, but the only argument with teeth that I saw made was high quality crop growing land versus lesser quality livestock. The problem of course is a lot of animals are factory farmed, and being fed grain from high quality crop growing land. ""Then my opponent says that the developing countries impact doesn't make sense and that I am agreeing the world should become vegan. These are both incorrect. First, the exclusion of second and third world countries from the pro contention means the pro can never solve which, on the most fundamental level possible, is the point I was trying to make. Second, I am saying that the entire world WOULD HAVE TO become vegan to make any real change, but not that it SHOULD. That is why I am Con in this debate."" Mary Second and third world countries are not within the scope of this debate. I've seen this type of argument made before, that the difference would be negligible. Yet, look at the numbers by simply getting rid of factory farmed beef we can save a lot of water and free up a lot of crop land. Every drop of water counts. ""Then my opponent says their authors are credible and mine would have to be vegan to be credible. First of all your authors are not credible. You applied their philosophy to prove people should be vegan, but they themselves weren't meaning obviously they did not feel the need to apply there own philosophy in the way you are doing as the pro. Second, my authors would actually have to be meat eaters to be credible because a) most of them are writing from medical and moral standpoints and b) they must practice what they preach to be credible."" Mary I think regardless of the person's diet what really matter is are they correct? Justice is always important. Sure MLK was not vegan, but I think its wrong to confine his words just to the issue he was addressing. I think Dawkins is correct that humans have drawn an arbitrary line between animals and humans. What Dawkins eats is irrelevant to the correctness of the previous statement. ""Finally my opponent addresses humane washing. I'd like to start off answering this by offering this article : https://medium.com...... (morality debate) . It gives empirical evidence as to how a vegan world would actually be a world more cruel to animals. The warrants are very long and I don't have enough characters to elaborate on them. I would also like to point out that my opponent has turned an argument they made on their own case into a reason to vote against them and that is this: logically, if meat is outlawed like a drug, prostitution, etc people would react violently and meat eating would become a violent merciless trade. Ever heard the expression ""laws are meant to be broken"" ?"" Mary Sadly, there is some logic to your statements about outlawing meat production. Just as many nations have lost the war on drugs, that making animals illegal to slaughter would create a black market. Yet, this fails to address humane washing. In fact, the words ""humane washing"" is not within the article. This is important, because there is virtually no difference between conventional and cage-free eggs. ""Extend all my health claims in round 1 including the counter claim I made at the very end. here are a couple of credible articles to contribute to the health debate: http://www.thehealthyhomeeconomist.com...... http://articles.mercola.com...... (health factor)"" Mary Mercola is renowned or being a quack. As for the healthyhomeeconomist it mentions that there is only 150 or so vegetables and plants. So what? How is that relevant? More importantly there is only like 5 animals we eat, and there is plenty of heirloom vegetables. Let's see chicken, pig, cow, turkey, and salmon. Far less variety in the animals we eat than 150. ""Next extend my ethics argument. My opponent has failed to disprove that ethics are solely a human concept . This is critical for the debate because applying justice to animals serves no purpose if animals themselves cannot recognize it as justice. It is simply self serving for the pro."" Mary Link 5 in previous round is Mercola the Quack. See my link 6 slaughtering the amazon. The mentally challenged and comatose patients don't understand justice, yet you can't just slaughter one for meat. They have rights too. The idea that the animal must recognize justice seems arbitrary. ""Next extend my economy argument at the top of my con case. Any risk of damaging the meat industry's GDP, even with gradual transition, means you vote neg because it is still the biggest impact in this round."" Mary Justice trumps economy, there is no way around this. People were upset about abolishing slavery of humans. Somehow we survived the economic downfall.

vegan,"Your point: ""The argument I made about me being more selfish was meant to be taken on a very, very broad scale. If I do support the murder of fellow earthlings than yeah, I am selfish. BUT, and I'm not saying it's okay, but why do we draw the line at animals' living condition (current state of life)? Why don't we draw the line at destroying their habitats, using them for testing and using them using them for experiments? And if the line is drawn there as well, why is the only frontline of this battle? Why is vegan the start of it all? "" Good point. So you are saying that many of us do our bit, for example charity work, and are not vegan. You should of expanded this point further, for its the only point I have heard from a meat-eater that I have found substantial. But it doesnt mean in any way, that eating meat is less bad than I already believe it is. But it does pose a threat to this particular debate, due to the reckless and cocky nature of my opening statement. However, I will attempt to refute. Lets take an imaginary man. He devotes his life to charity, he spends all of his time and effort on helping people who need help. He eats meat. So he is not less caring or more selfish as he is very caring and selfless. But he must be more ignorant to life on earth because if he is so much moved by the needy, then he would care for the needy animals too. So if he is genuine in his compassion, he would care for the animals too. If he eats meat, then he must be somewhat ignorant to what he is supporting-either he has never questioned it, he thinks that animals are like robots or he thinks that they have happy lives. All three are examples of ignorance. At least, more ignorance, too animals, than vegans. You say: ""We are selfish, and we are eating at another's expense, but if we enjoy it, it boosts our morale and mental health. Mental health is an important part of anyone's overall health. Now, it's wrong to seek this pleasure in the form of murder, but because it was introduced to us, it's hard to go back."" That logic is what keeps us from moving forward. You admit it's wrong, how can you then condone it on the grounds it can feel good, without sounding like somebody who may have knowledge of right and wrong, but has little intention of actually doing the right thing? Slavery was maintained on your logic would you not agree? I will tackle your point regain riding murder. You say murder is unjustified killing, what does that really mean? So you can kill something and it not be murder? The definitions are irrelevant to the reality of death. Does the fact that it doesn't fit the definition of murder, make it any less unfair? Besides that, animals cannot even be 'murdered' by the Oxford dictionary's definition of the word so this terminology class is irrelevant. But you also say something else wrong: 'murder is unjustified, killing animals is justified'. Murders are justified to the murderer. And how is killing an animal for a pleasurable meal, more justifiable than killing a person for revenge? Revenge seems more justifiable than a meal to me. You point about them dying if they where set free is a total contradiction. So on the one hand you seem to care for the survival of the species, but really it's just so they can serve you. We don't have to murder all the animals, that are going to be murdered anyway, we just stop getting them to mate. And no, the species wouldn't die out, Zoo's and pet animal loves will make sure they don't. And your point about the economy. Not eating meat could end world hunger. It takes 24x more clean water to make a pound of meat than a pound of grain. It takes something like 15 pounds of grain to make one pound of meat. And this debate is about individuals, not the broader society.

Things I consider facts:

* I **can** be vegan. I have time, money, access and health to make that choice.
* Animal suffering is bad.
* The environment damage and global warming is bad.
* Individuals must  be willing to make sacrifices for ethical reasons even if their contribution is small.

I won't get mad if you try to argue those but you're not likely to shift me on those basic principles. Health impact is already not a factor for me (I don't think being vegan is clearly healthier).

These facts  I could be wrong about or missing some key aspect of:

* Buying animal products directly supports a system that causes animal suffering.
* Buying animal products is harmful for the environment (relative to eating plants) because of emissions, water/land use, etc.

So my overall logic is that eating animal products harms the environment and animals, and that's a bad thing thing, I have the ability to avoid this bad thing, so I am obligated to avoid this bad thing. To do otherwise would be selfishly harming the world just for my pleasure.

vegan,"Thank you Con for your opening statements. Introduction Firstly, I will begin by responding to my opponent's arguments for why a meat diet is better. Secondly, I will defend my original arguments for why veganism is better than a meat eating lifestyle. Nature Here Con argues that humans are meant to eat meat because we have molars and K-9 teeth. This is more of a statement of fact rather than an argument for why a meat lifestyle is better than a vegan one. I really don't even have to respond to it for that reason. However, I will do so anyways. Yes, humans can eat meat but that doesn't mean that we ought to. I could go next door and eat my neighbor's newborn. His baby is, after all, made of meat like animals. However, I think we would all agree that just because I CAN do that doesn't mean that I should. Food Chain Here Con argues that eating animals is morally permissible because animals in the wilderness eat other animals. This too, is not an argument for why a meat diet is better than a vegan one. However, I will respond to it anyway. Yes, animals in the wild eat other animals, but this is more of a statement of fact rather than an argument. It seems like you're saying that because animals do that, it must be morally permissible for humans to do so as well. This is seriously problematic, because if we start to derive our moral values from what other animals do, then many things can no longer be consider immoral. Rape, infanticide, aggressive fights, ect. are all things that occur in the animal kingdom. Do we really want to say that because other animals do these things that we ourselves should be allowed to do them as well? I think not. Nutrition Here Con argues that meat is superior to plants when it comes to getting protein. He didn't exactly explain how it's superior. So for now, I will dismiss his claim. Taste Here Con argues that meat is one of the tastiest parts of the meal. This, I think, is kind of subjective. There are many people who do not like the taste of meat, and who prefer other foods. Con mistakenly thinks that all vegans eat is vegetables. This is untrue, because pretty much every food can be made vegan. Even things like meat. Whole grains, beans, nuts, seeds, pasta, pizza, lentils, tofu, tempeh, seitan, ect. are just a few of the many foods out there for people abstaining from animal products. The Individual or Society? Con says that my arguments are simply stating that a vegan society is better, and that it is not addressing the individual person. And therefore my arguments are not even relevant to the debate. The individual and society distinction was not made clear in the rules of the debate. It was NOT, ""A Vegan lifestyle is better than a meat-eating one for the individual,"" or ""A Vegan lifestyle is better than a meat-eating one for society."" The debate topic was simply, ""A Vegan lifestyle is better than a meat-eating one."" I think Con is trying to conveniently make this distinction in the middle of the debate to make it easier for himself. However, even if I were to grant this distinction, veganism can still be shown to be better. While it's true that one person switching to a vegan diet isn't going to stop the meat industry, it does save nearly 200 animals per year [1] from the miserable existence on a modern farm. As I pointed out earlier, according to a study in the UK, dropping animal products from your diet saves 50% more carbon emissions than driving a Prius. So even if we ignore the society part of it, and instead look at it from the individual's perspective, veganism is still better. Veganism is Kinder Towards Animals Here Con argues that the animals we raise on farms are meant to be food. This is again, more of a statement of fact rather than an argument. Of course those animals are there to be killed for our food. That's why we continue to breed them on a massive scale. However, what's the moral justification for us doing this to animals? I don't see it. This statement made by Con could have also been used by a white slave owner in the 18th century. To demonstrate this, let change the word animals with Africans, and the phrase ""to be food"" with ""to pick cotton."" Observe: ""The Africans we have on plantations are meant to pick cotton, would you all rather go back to picking your own cotton?"" I believe Alice Walker said it best with her quote: ""The animals of the world exist for their own reasons. They were not made for humans any more than black people were made for white, or women created for men."" [2] Con says that it's more mean to not buy animal flesh at the store, because by doing that the animal has died for nothing. This line of reasoning is baffling. The animal whose flesh is being sold has already died for nothing, given that we don't even need to eat meat. By purchasing that flesh you are not doing the animals a favor. All you're doing is contributing to the continued existence, prosperity, and slaughter of more animals. Veganism is Better For The Environment I already explained how vegans individually do help the environment by saving more carbon emissions, and not producing huge amounts of greenhouse gas emissions like meat eaters. Conclusion Con has literally given no reasons to believe that an omnivore lifestyle is better than a vegan one. I, on the other hand, have given various reasons for thinking that a vegan lifestyle is best.

vegan,"Lacto ovo vegetarian = hippopotamus: A lacto ovo vegetarian diet excludes meat, fish, and poultry but includes dairy products and eggs. So you say hippopotamus is lacto ovo vegetarian. Great! We have a place to start. Under your definition hippopotamus eat eggs, milk and cheese, but they are strictly vegan; they are just faking eating eggs and cheese to be cool. Hippopotamuses munch on grasses, water plants and such things. Yes, they sometimes bite on a person or alligator who get in their faces from time to time; but they do spit them out, just yucky. Did you know that a hippopotami""s closest relative is whales and porpoises, who are not non-vegan? They will eat just about anything that moves. So much for cousins taking up the ethical family""s eating habits in an effort to save animal lives. Also, the word hippopotamus is from an ancient Greek word (strange alphabet that does not cut and paste) which means water horse. A horse is a vegan also; yeah! Hippopotamus are classified along with other two toed animals such as camels, cattle, deer and pigs. Camels and cattle are vegans, pigs not so much; non-vegans. But, camels are related to llamas and alpacas; cows have their cousin the bison, deer are related to elks and gazelles; all are vegan. Bonus points for this group. So there you have it, horses, camels, deer, cattle, bison, alpacas, llamas, elks, gazelles and hippopotamus are hippopotamus therefore, vegans pretending to be Lacto ovo vegetarians who care about ethics by not eating other animals.

vegan,"Meat eaters are not ignorant in my opinion. I am sure there are many biologists, gastroenterologists, vets, and pro animal rights people who eat meat, me falling under the last one. Being at least one of the things on the preceding list should disqualify ignorance as a reason for eating meat. Personally, I enjoy meat because of preference. I understand what happens on farms, factories, butcher shops, restaurants, etc with meat. More selfish? Well, what's selfish? Selfish seems to mean that one cares for one's self without any regards to others. I will agree that selfish is a proper word to use. Meat eaters take advantage of life on earth for personal gain and pleasure. However, we as humans are way past selfish all together. Anyone taking part in the industrial revolution and the results of it are selfish. We take advantage of earth and the things of it for our own personal gain or pleasure. We chop down trees, we dirty up water, we burn oil and coal, we dig and landscape every other acre of earth, we capture animals and genetically change them to be our fluffy pets instead of letting them roam free in the environment, we run over squirrels, and instead of eating food that grows from our surroundings, we destroy land that is already there, plant new plants that aren't natural to the area, and then they take the crops and turn them in to something more desired. Simply put, humans are selfish. We all do things that destroy the environment for our personal gain with little regards for the environment. So, we as humans are selfish and care less about others for our own personal reasons. If this debate is how vegans are better and smarter than meat eaters, than this debate is not a good idea. You and I (I'm assuming you're a vegan) are only different because of our eating choices. We are both, at the end of the day are selfish, less caring beings because we are humans. You have been destructive to the environment for pleasure and personal gain, just as I have. So, I am a more selfish, less caring person than you are because I have different eating choices?

vegan,"Thank you for your response. The argument I made about me being more selfish was meant to be taken on a very, very broad scale. If I do support the murder of fellow earthlings than yeah, I am selfish. BUT, and I'm not saying it's okay, but why do we draw the line at animals' living condition (current state of life)? Why don't we draw the line at destroying their habitats, using them for testing and using them for experiments? And if the line is drawn there as well, why is the only frontline of this battle? Why is vegan the start of it all? Animals who are not meant to eat meat would probably reject it when ingested, however, humans, whom are animals, do not reject it (actually, on some scale, I do. I have IBS but... another story another time). I know this area of this popular debate was not mentioned, I just wanted to throw that out there. I hope it can be understood that I am running on zero sleep right now and I am not 100% focused, so what may seem off topic or weird is just me typing with one eye closed. but my turn is almost up and I shall fight through. Something I want to cover is this pleasure. We are selfish, and we are eating at another's expense, but if we enjoy it, it boosts our morale and mental health. Mental health is an important part of anyone's overall health. Now, it's wrong to seek this pleasure in the form of murder (I think murder is the incorrect word for this and I will explain why soon) in my opponent's eyes, however, because it was introduced to us, it is hard to go back. Now about that murder: murder seemes to be a word meaning unjustified killing. Meat is justifiable. At this point, having had captured and farmed so many animals for so long, many farm animals have genetically changed over time to depend largly on humans, making life hard for them if they were free. We as humans let them live a pretty good life before meeting it's end. My point is, it would take a lot of years to reverse what we have done, and it would also destroy the first world (and some lesser) economies. So many states in the United States and European States rely on having meat used. By the time we are able to stop and reverse our damage, humans will be on their way out of their turn on Earth.",CON,"Now, it's wrong to seek this pleasure in the form of murder (I think murder is the incorrect word for this and I will explain why soon) in my opponent's eyes, however, because it was introduced to us, it is hard to go back. ...

The grounds are that it is better for your health, the earth, and for humanity. As far as your health goes more and more people are switching to the vegan lifestyle. People are finding that they have increase energy and younger looking skin. With the right diet of plants you can acquire the right amount of protein, iron, calcium and other essential vitamins and minerals. The nutrients tend to be low in saturated fat, high in fiber and packed with antioxidants, which in some cases lessens the chances of obesity, heart disease, diabetes and cancer. Secondly the Production of meat places a heavy burden on the environment. The feeding of the animals and the transportation of the product is a hefty impact on the environment. Also the carbon footprint is increased because of the methane flatulence from cattle farming. For humanity veganism is the sustainable option when it comes to our planet.

vegan,"I accept and thank my opponent for setting up this debate. To get the formalities out of the way; Resolution ""Everyone who has the ability to adopt a vegan diet should do so."" As Con, I will be arguing against this resolution. As Pro pointed out, this resolution does not cover those whose bodies cannot sustain such a diet due to, what I assume Pro means, a sort of sickness or disease stopping them from being able to survive without meat specifically. Definitions 1. Vegan - One who does not eat meat, dairy, eggs or use any animal products* * This debate seems to be about diet specifically, so non-edible animal products will most likely not be discussed, but since it is part of veganism I've decided to include it in the definition anyway in case it does come up. 2. Ability - The capacity to do something 3. Diet - The kinds of food that a person, animal, or community habitually eats Burden of Proof Pro will have the BOP as he is advocating a dietary shift from the current status quo. Given that the scope of Pro's resolution includes ""everyone"", it falls unto Pro to argue for the sustainability of a vegan diet relative to both the individual and society, meaning Pro must show that a vegan diet can be just as healthy (if not moreso) than a non-vegan diet and show that such a diet could be economically adopted by society. Pro has also opted to argue for the morality of veganism, but unless Pro also intends on arguing for objective morality, the ""morality"" of veganism becomes relative to the form of morality being discussed, which defeats the purpose of arguing for the morality of anything. Given this, I recommend that Pro does not predicate his case on moral grounds and instead focuses on health and environmental reasons, less this becomes a debate on morality rather than veganism.

vegan,"Rebuttals Opponent's argument is in bold and italics mine are in plain text. ""I think I should start off by saying what I am arguing against. According to Merriam-Webster, vegan is defined as: a person who does not eat any food that comes from animals and who often also does not use animal products (such as leather). So pro has the burden of proof to prove that not eating meat at all, or even using any animal products for any means is inherently better for the environment. "" Delta2401 Considering the topic about eating vegan the parts about leather should be dropped. You are not seriously comparing eating leather shoes to vegan shoes are you? More importantly the topic is about comparing omnivore as in meat eater to vegan. So the shoes would have to be made out of meat to be relevant. ""an animal that eats both plants and other animals"" [10] Reforestation has its own problems. [11] Mainly, that fast growing exotic trees only solve some problems while creating others. Many trees that are cut down are very old and will take a very long time to replace with a tree of the same age. Also, the species gone extinct from the origin deforestation are more or less lost forever. ""Grain stores for cows Pro made bad comparison to grain enough to feed 9 billion people. The number isn't relevant if it can be done sustainably, and it wasn't linked to an actual finite number of how much we can support."" Delta2401 The exact quote is within the documentary. Considering there is 30 million or so cattle slaughtered each year. [12] Also, over one billion cattle in the world. [13]. This figure sounds right. Think about one billion cattle requiring 16x the grain is sixteen billion people that could be fed on this grain. ""But I want to go beyond just that. Can 9 million people really live off that grain alone? The problem with the comparison is that to live the vegan lifestyle, grain would not give you near enough protein, etc for that. You need a wide variety of fruits and vegetables to get the nutrients you need to live off of. So no, 9 billion people could not live off that. It could certainly help give 9 billion people a staple meal in the world, but they would still be malnourished."" Delta2401 Nine billion, not nine million people. Protein would probably be the least of concerns considering humans only need about 10% calories from protein. [14] I would never recommend a diet of all grains, but its still better than starving. Malnutrition is better than famine. Considering children still starve to death, the first priority is amble food then nutrition. [15][16]. ""Water Supplies Pro has also stated we cannot support the plants we need to also support a meat industry. This is under the faulty assumption we can't fix our water issue seperately. For instance, Israel, someone who exports massive amounts of produce to places like europe and Russia[5], gets a huge amount of water from the mediterranean, and is a pioneer in desalination plants [6]. They use drip methods to give just the right amount of water to their farm plants, without being wasteful[7]. If the proper motivation and funding went into forging sustainable water supplies for the world, we have so much water in the world where we can more than sustain everyone many times over. This is a case of mismanagement and going full steam ahead, but not something that cannot be addressed for the population who may want to eat meat, and have enough water supplies in the future."" Delta Desalination via reverse osmosis is resource intensive. A desalination plant takes resources to build in the first place $500 million a for the one mentioned. Not all farms are located near an ocean. You still have to transport the water. Finally, the water in the ocean serves to regulate the Earth's temperature. While we have a massive amount of water in the ocean, the resource is ultimately finite. ""Cattle/Grain Effiency This is an irrelevant thing to add to the discussion when we have clear up the idea of space (more on that later), and water. Because then it just doesn't matter as much. When you address those sustainably, you can then sustainably increase it to whatever levels you want to feed your cattle sustainably..."" Delta I think my opponent meant to finish this later, for now its non-sequitur. I am running out of characters so I will stop quoting my opponent. Aquaponics is vastly different than our current farming systems. Your warrant doesn't back up your statement enough. There is not enough information on aquaponics to make a determination either way. Deer can be trapped, neutered, and released as opposed to hunted down. I don't know about you, but I don't want a hunter shooting deer in the middle of a city. Summary of rebuttals My opponent made some interesting ideas. Many of them which would be a drastic overhaul to the entire system of agriculture. The expensive desalination plants are a prime example. We already grow vegan products. Furthermore, my opponent hasn't really proved that any of these methods are more environmentally friendly than vegan. Therefore, my opponent is comparing experimental and prototype methods using state of the art technology that at best may have equal environmental damage to vegan. Vegan on the other hand we know is environmentally friendly. My opponent has conceded much ground by not defending factory farming. Thus, all that is left is the tried and true method of veganism versus new omnivore techniques that may or may not produce the results they claim. Thanks for reading and debating.

vegan,"""More importantly the topic is about comparing omnivore as in meat eater to vegan. So the shoes would have to be made out of meat to be relevant."" I think you mistook my intentions. I was trying to point out that by proving the killing of any animal in this case for food is a good thing, either by hunting or otherwise. ""Mainly, that fast growing exotic trees only solve some problems while creating others. Many trees that are cut down are very old and will take a very long time to replace with a tree of the same age. Also, the species gone extinct from the origin deforestation are more or less lost forever. "" So, just like I mentioned myself, mismanagement? But are you saying a forest can't possibly be planted in a manner that includes older tree types, or other animals? Those 200 year old trees used to be 1 year old too. I do recommend you watch the documentary Dirt as talked about in my previous arguments. It does demonstrate a good way this can be done, in just about any climate. ""The exact quote is within the documentary."" But you aren't the documentary, the documentary is a source for you so we know where it is you are getting your information from and verify your claims. But you never gave the full quote, or the context; and as such your argument fell short and incomplete. You just said something with no number of the finite limit. And even the quote you listed here in this argument, ""the full quote"", just shows that 16 billion people would get a weak grain diet to feed the 1 billion cattle. It still doesn't answer the question on how much the world can reasonably support. Without that number,the 1 billion cattle to feed vs the people it can feed is just a number, and a comparison that doesn't prove that it is inheritantly better or worse for the environment. Because it doesn't prove whether or not it can be sustained without larger numbers of the environmental capacity by itself. ""Nine billion, not nine million people. "" Good catch, I think I caught myself a bit later in the quote where I stated billion, then forgot that I already stated million above. However, this still doesn't invalidate any point, because the number wasn't the point of the argument. ""Protein would probably be the least of concerns considering humans only need about 10% calories from protein."" Which humans? The average human doing average human activities? But what about those who want to be athletes or very fit/healthy people? ""I would never recommend a diet of all grains, but its still better than starving. Malnutrition is better than famine. Considering children still starve to death, the first priority is amble food then nutrition."" Not the point. The beef for instance would be much more fulfilling towards the nutrition, despite things like fat and other potential problems when too much is consumed, compared to grain. Are you saying the starving people in the world will be fed with grain if we switched to such a system, and thus there wouldn't be the famine in places like Africa? The problem isn't their inability to grow enough crops or even cattle to feed their populations, but the big three issues the professionals in the sitiatuition point to is: (1) - Conflict Causes Hunger in Africa, like civil war. , (2) Climate Change, while yes, this effects crop output, the problem really can be tied to uncertainty, and can be mititaged by a better, more effficient and stable government/and infastructure. And this isn't even going into perhaps changing what kinds of meat/plants are grown for food in the newer climates. (3) Donor Country Politics. So no, I think throwing around those 16 billion numbers of being fed is just an emotional plea, and one that actually doesn't mean at all that they will be fed even then. On top of the fact, they would have better nutrition if it wasn't just bases in grain, especially since it hasn't been proven by it that they can't be sustained with beef yet. ""Desalination via reverse osmosis is resource intensive. A desalination plant takes resources to build in the first place $500 million a for the one mentioned. Not all farms are located near an ocean. You still have to transport the water. "" The 500 million is not the point, but a red herring. We are not arguing on how much it may cost to get a sustainable meat market, that is not bad for the enviroment. Just that it can be done, and thus it is not inherently bad for the enviroment. Plus, even at 500 million - it is still much better. Because it sustains more than 70% of the entire Israeli populalations water supply. I would consider that a bargain. You have completely ignored the drip method for transportation. And proper methods if irrigation can actually be beneficial to the enviroment anyway, even without the farms. Bringing water to the desert, etc... So by arguing the transportation of the water - it isn't that simply. One could argue just doing that by itself is actually GOOD for the enviroment, outweighing and fuel and transportation cost in regards to the pro/con to the environmental impact. ""Finally, the water in the ocean serves to regulate the Earth's temperature. While we have a massive amount of water in the ocean, the resource is ultimately finite. "" What? No one is arguing that they don't regulate the earths water. Are you going to argue that we are going to drain the oceans enough where they would not be able to regulate the tempature in the same way? Are you saying that we can drain the oceans? I would love to see your sources on that. I could go on about the actual numbers we use, vs the absolute vastness of the oceans, and how about only 3% of the world's water is freshwater, and even how much we have tapped already is incredibly small. But to consider us treating it as if we are in danger of actually running out of that finite resource in the foreseeable future I am definitely going to need to see a source for to treat that in any way seriously. ""Aquaponics is vastly different than our current farming systems. Your warrant doesn't back up your statement enough. There is not enough information on aquaponics to make a determination either way."" I think it should be pointed out that is not what we are arguing. You are trying to prove eating vegan is better for the enviroment. I am not trying to argue that we have bad farming practices. I am trying to prove that we can farm in a way that we don't need to go vegan. Thus, eating vegan is not necessarily better for the environment. The fact that it is different than our current farming systems is a non-sequiter itself. Not what is being discussed. ""I don't know about you, but I don't want a hunter shooting deer in the middle of a city."" Appeal to opinion/emotion. ""My opponent made some interesting ideas. Many of them which would be a drastic overhaul to the entire system of agriculture."" Then let us do them instead, and help the environment and still help people who want to eat meat eat meat. ""We already grow vegan products"" Non-sequiter. We already grow meat products. So? ""Opponent hasn't really proved that any of these methods are more environmentally friendly than vegan. "" You are the instigator. You have the burden to prove that vegan is better for the enviroment than any non-vegan alternatives. I don't have to prove anything other than the fact that eating vegan is not necessarily better for the enviroment. I don't have to prove it is better at all. ""Therefore, my opponent is comparing experimental and prototype methods using state of the art technology"" Not the point, and you are shifting the burden of proof. Space issue. As promised, I will get into space a little bit. Various greenhouses can maximize sunlight, watering, etc to grow more food in smaller areas. There are urban projects to grow more food in many unused vacant areas, there are plenty of possibilities.

vegan,"Counter Arguments: ""I am not saying we should force anyone to be vegan, meat should not be illegal to consume."" -You are right. You are not saying we should force anyone to be vegan. You used the word ""should"", which does not imply force, but instead implies obligation, as shown in the definition I provided. -Therefore, you are saying that everyone in the world is obligated to become a vegan. And I argued that not everyone is obligated to become vegan. ""Killing animals is not a nice thing to do, and not doing it is the right moral thing to do, for our society."" -Pro has not explained the morality bit of his argument. How is it immoral to provide your population with food? ""People always say its natural to eat meat. True."" -Pro has conceded that eating meat is natural for humans. If it is natural for us to eat meat, then why are we obligated to not eat meat. Why are we obligated to be unnatural, even when a lot of us don't want to? ""Its not natural however, to eat the meat of any animal that has not been hunted fairly."" -It's actually very natural. Even animals do it. Tigers have claws and sharp teeth. That's not fair for the prey they hunt. Yet they hunt and eat their prey for their own survival. ""No, it's not what our ancestors did. However even if it was what we did, this fact alone would not be sufficient in proving its righteousness, as our ancestors did many things that we would not endorse now."" -Actually, the fact that our ancestors did it is enough to justify it. If our ancestors did not develop tools to hunt and had a vegan diet, they would have gone extinct and we would not exist today. Our ancestors needed to hunt and kill animals for their survival back when they were hunter-gatherers. Vegetation alone is not enough and killing animals gave them more benefits than just food. If our ancestors had not hunted mammoths, they would have had no shelter and clothes, leaving them to freeze in the Ice Age. ""The only reason most people don't think it's bad, is because they don't know enough, and they don't have to do the killing."" -That is not true. I am positive most of our population knows that the meat they eat are dead animals. And many of them kill animals too. I've gone fishing several times and killed fish, which I ate. And I don't think it's bad at all. ""Repetitive stress is 35 times higher in slaughter house workers than manufacture workers."" -Pro has not provided a source to support this claim. -If everyone was vegan, those workers would be out of a job. I'm certain most slaughter house workers would much rather kill animals so that they can support their families than to lose their jobs and their right to eat meat. ""Somebody once said ""the true test of a man is in his treatment of his inferiors"". If we believe this to be true then shouldn't we treat animals better than we do now? Or do you not agree with this statement?"" -That quote can have multiple contrasting interpretations. -While the statement is claiming that a person's value is determined by his/her treatment of inferiors, it doesn't say that crushing your inferiors is bad nor does it say treating them better is good. -Thus, this quote does not support your stance. ""So my first point is that it's wrong to make anyone suffer, I hope my opponent doesn't disagree with this."" -I disagree with this. There are actually many instances in which making someone suffer can be justified. For example, murderers and rapiers suffer in prison. But is it wrong to put them in prison? -Furthermore, Pro has not explained why it's wrong to make anyone suffer. ""My second argument is that it would be better for the environment and the environment is essential."" -Not at all. Be it vegan or meat-eating people, the same greenhouse emissions are being made. The only time greenhouse emissions are being made off of meat is when you use fuel cook it. Killing an animal and gutting it does not release greenhouse gases. Furthermore, you cook vegan food too! -The only other way the production of meat releases greenhouse gases is through transporting them by planes and trucks to different parts of the world to be consumed. But we'd still have cars and planes if we were vegans and we'd still transport fruits and vegetables through cars and planes if we were vegans, so if the world was vegan, the environment would not be significantly helped. ""It takes about 2,400 litres of clean water to make one pound of meat."" -That is because animals drink water. Cows drink 150 litres of water a day. The average cattle cow that we eat lives 15 years. That means that one cow drinks 8,212,50 litres of water before it dies. Obviously it takes a lot of water to ready 1 pound of meat for consumption. -But here's the thing. Cows drink that much water whether we eat them or not. So the fact that it takes lots of water to make meat doesn't even matter because that much water is being used anyway whether we eat them or not. -Furthermore, water doesn't stay in cows forever. Cows urinate it out and it goes through the water cycle. By the time you eat the one pound of meat, that 2,400 litres of water is already in the oceans, clouds, and plants. Water is a renewable resource. We never run out of water. -Therefore, water is not an issue. ""Livestock take up more land than humans! About 30% of our earth we devote to livestock."" -Why is this a problem? We can't do anything about this even if we were vegan! If we became vegan, our former livestock still exist and breed, thus they still take up space and land. -The only way we can recover land back from livestock is to kill them all, which would be a huge waste of meat if we were vegan. Furthermore, vegans don't kill animals! -So, in the end, if we all become vegan, 30% of our earth are still taken by livestock and because we don't kill them, they will keep breeding and increasing in numbers. Therefore, if we become vegan, even more of our earth will be taken up by livestock that we don't kill and eat. ""It would make people more healthy and thus happier and less of a burden on society."" -Health and happiness are not deeply connected. As a matter of fact, I would be less happy because some of my favorite foods contain meat, milk, and cheese. And the fact that I can't eat them will make me less happy. -As mentioned in my 5th contention last round, billions of people will lose jobs. The unemployed are the burden of society economic wise. Therefore if the world was vegan people would be more of a burden on society. ""Well may I ask you if you think we had an obligation to free the slaves?"" -We have an obligation to free slaves because slavery violates the Human Rights I mentioned in my first contention last round. [1] -The 4th Human Right prohibits slavery. Therefore we are obligated to be against slavery. There are no Human Rights prohibiting drinking milk or eating cheese and meat, therefore we are not obligated to become vegan. ""We don't have an obligation."" -Pro has conceded that there is no obligation for mankind to become vegan, thus negating his resolution. ""So the real question is: do you have 'being good' as an obligation or not."" -People have different views of what 'being good' means. You are using your own view and trying to account for every human being in the world. -I do not follow your view of 'being good', and I was never obligated to follow your beliefs in the first place. ""The morality of the world does not come the human rights treaty."" -It doesn't come from you either. -However, the Human Rights is the closest thing to it mankind can get because it's the only thing almost every nation has agreed upon. ""Organised animal cruelty will just be illegal. Don't you see the hypocrisy though my friend?"" -Organised animal cruelty is illegal because in most cases we don't eat them. I don't see the hypocrisy. ""what about the animals choices? Do they not matter?"" -Humans eat animals. Animals don't want to be eaten by humans, but humans want to eat them. Humans and animals want different things. If I had to choose, I would side with my own species. ""You are using the idea of rights to deny rights!"" -Humans and animals have different rights, and this is due mainly to the fact that we are more intelligent than them. A human can get the right to wield weapons and drive vehicles. Animals cannot have these rights. Therefore we have different rights. ""If nobody ate meat, they would be no meat products available."" -Yes, but people HAVE eaten meat, and meat products have ALREADY been available! Your resolutions states ""we should move towards a world where everybody is vegan"", implying that all the meat eaters today stop eating meat tomorrow. ""in that typical scenario that happens to us all (being stranded in the wilderness), eating an animal to survive is survival"" -Pro has conceded again that there are instances in which not being vegan is allowed. ""Food reduction argument-totally wrong, look at my points."" -Your points haven't shown why it is ""totally wrong"".

vegan,"I concede that a super well-educated, highly intelligent nutritionist could make veganism a healthier way of life than other diet choices. However we must face the sad fact that this group of people is a tiny majority. Most people struggle with the idea of where their food comes from, let alone protein, vitamin and mineral content. So for the average person, being vegan poses a serious risk. Whereas when you eat a wide range of foods (as is inevitable if you have no dietary preferences), it's actually quite difficult to avoid a nutrient entirely, if you are a vegan, it is simply much easier. If you exclude fish from your diet, you exclude omega 3s and 6s, when you exclude meat, you exclude primary sources of protein, when you exclude milk, you exclude a crucial source of calcium... So the list goes on. If you make sufficient compensation for these issues, it is not a problem. However the majority of people don't appreciate the wide range of nutrients you end up omitting from your diet when you become vegan. Even for those who do, sometimes alternative foods have to be taken in such enormous quantities that its just impractical. Daily buckets of chickpeas simply aren't always the most efficient to ingest sufficient protein. So while, in theory, being vegan avoids health problems like cardiovascular disease (often caused by too much animal fats) it is not a healthier way of life. Suggesting that it is a healthier way of life entirely fails to address the fact that cardiovascular disease and problems with over consumption are often replaced with the equally dangerous problems that come with under consumption. Nutrient deficiency, protein deficiency and even starvation are just a few of the problems that omitting so many food groups can inadvertently cause. Another flaw in your argument is the fact that you seem to think becoming vegan will magically make your entire lifestyle healthier, not just your diet. This is quite simply not true. Taking all animal products out of your diet will not do one iota to change how much time you spend on the couch, how many times you go running a week or whether you walk or take the car. A healthy lifestyle is so much more than diet and therefore it is impossible to say that changing one aspect of your diet will have a magical knock on effect on the rest of your life choices.",CON,"So while, in theory, being vegan avoids health problems like cardiovascular disease (often caused by too much animal fats) it is not a healthier way of life. ...

Then my opponent made a claim that if you eat from wide source of foods it is very hard to be deficient in vitamins but if you are vegan it is easier which is true since some animals have more amounts of certain nutrients by how much not that much. He also said that excluding fish form your diet will make you deficient in omegas 3 and omegas 6 which also not true there are many plants that have those same nutrients that have about the same amount of grams ratio of fish. These foods include avocados and green leafy vegetables which if you are vegan you will be eating a lot of green leafy vegetables, and if you don""t corn, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and nuts too. Also, too the calcium and protein deficient problems which rarely happens in any diet it""s almost impossible to get protein deficiency""s beans have about the same amount of protein for beef that weighs 100 grams and many other plants that give you the sufficient amount protein you need broccoli, kale, and many other vegetables that are like them.

Delta2401 A two hundred year old tree, took two hundred years to grow. We can't simply plant a saplings and have it grow 200 years over night. That's the problem with reforestation. Whee, lets knock down 1,000 two hundred year old trees, and replace them with 10,000 saplings. Look at us we are so great, now there are ten times as many trees in the area than before we worked. There is no way those saplings can keep the air clean as well as the old trees. Not only that but many of the saplings will die before reaching maximum growth. They will shade and root competition each other out. You ignored my argument about species becoming extinct from deforestation staying extinct. Finally, I don't have free access to watch the Dirt documentary so I have no idea if the claims you make about the documentary are valid or not.

I can't even find hardly any information on aquaponics. Let's put it another way. I over kill my burden of proof in round 1. You bring up aquaponics then demand I prove that vegan is better than aquaponics, a subject I know almost nothing about. This would be a completely unfair burden of proof on me to disprove every notion my opponent brings up, even if my opponent provides little to no evidence that notion is correct. ""Not the point, and you are shifting the burden of proof."" Delta2401 You seem to be using the burden of proof as an excuse not to argue points you brought up.

Not only that, but I would have to be all-knowing to know every single meat production method that exists. This would present an impossible burden of proof for me.

vegan,"Thank you Con for starting this debate. I hope to have an interesting and civil dialogue with you. Introduction At first I was unsure if I wanted to take part in this debate. This is because the word ""better"" was not clearly defined. By better one could mean that an omnivore diet has tastier food, is more convenient, and for that reason it should be considered ""better."" However, I'm going to interpret the word better to mean that a vegan lifestyle is superior to an omnivore one for various reasons. With that said, let me begin. Definition of veganism according to the Vegan Society: Veganism is a way of living which seeks to exclude, as far as is possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose. [1] Veganism is Kinder Towards Animals This, I think, is pretty obvious. In order for animal products to be produced, animals must be exploited. In modern animal agriculture we confine animals for their entire lives and make them miserable. They are denied proper veterinary care, free space to move around and exercise, appropriate social interaction with members of their species, and anesthesia during the process of castration and other mutilations. Once these animals reach market weight, they are sent to a slaughterhouse where they are hung upside down and have their throat slit. In 2013, a USDA inspector at a chicken slaughterhouse pointed out that: ""[Workers] are literally throwing the birds into the shackles, often breaking their legs as they do it... They are working so fast, they sometimes get just one leg in the shackles. When that happens, the chickens aren't hanging right... They don't get killed, and they go into the scald tank alive."" [2] In ""Modern Meat: A Brutal Harvest,"" a 2001 article from the Washington Post, a worker at a slaughterhouse for cattle describes the disturbing reality of insufficient stunning: ""It takes 25 minutes to turn a live steer into steak at the modern slaughterhouse where Ramon Moreno works. For 20 years, his post was ‘second-legger,’ a job that entails cutting hocks off carcasses as they whirl past at a rate of 309 an hour. ""The cattle were supposed to be dead before they got to Moreno. But too often they weren’t. ""They blink. They make noises,’ he said softly. ‘The head moves, the eyes are wide and looking around.’ ""Still Moreno would cut. On bad days, he says, dozens of animals reached his station clearly alive and conscious. Some would survive as far as the tail cutter, the belly ripper, the hide puller. ""They die,’ said Moreno, ‘piece by piece.’ [3] To help put what I have said into perspective, I will link a short documentary by Mercy For Animals that demonstrates some of the things I have been talking about: Viewing animals as commodities for us to use for our pleasure and convenience is inhumane and disrespectful. If we think it's morally wrong to ignore the suffering of human beings, then we should also think it's morally wrong to ignore the suffering of nonhuman animals that we use for food. Veganism is Better For The Environment Animal production is a major contributor to climate change. In November of 2006 the United Nations came out with a report called "" Livestock's Long Shadow"" where they explained that animal production was a bigger contributor to climate change than all of the Earth's cars, trucks, buses, airplanes, and trains combined. The ICPP, which is an intergovernmental panel on climate change, has also said: ""Please eat less meat -- meat is a very carbon intensive commodity... this is something that the IPCC was afraid to say earlier, but now we have said it."" [4] According to a study in the UK, dropping meat, dairy and eggs from your diet saves 50% more carbon emissions than driving a Prius. This study showed that an average 2,000 kcal high-meat diet has 2.5 times as many greenhouse gas emissions as an average vegan diet. [5] The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization has also said that raising animals for food--including land used for grazing and land used to grow feed crops for farmed animals--now uses a staggering 30% of the Earth's land mass. According to Greenpeace, nearly 80% of land deforested in the Amazon is now used as cattle pasture. [6] Veganism is A Superior Alternative To Fighting World Hunger In the U.S. we feed more than 70% of grain and soybeans to animals, [7] and in doing so we waste most of the food value of the grains that we're feeding them. If all the grain currently fed to livestock in the United States were consumed directly by people, the number of people who could be fed would be nearly 800 million. [8] Depending on the species, the animals may return to us somewhere between 1/10th and 1/3rd of the food value of the grains and soybeans that we put into them. So we are just wasting huge amounts of food in order to produce the large amount of animal products. It would be better and more practical if we fed our grains and soybeans to people, instead of feeding them to billions of land animals. One acre of land can yield 30,000 pounds of carrots, 40,000 pounds of potatoes or 50,000 pounds of tomatoes. However, one acre of land can yield only 250 pounds of meat, which means that a meat, dairy and egg diet is an unsuccessful way to combat world hunger, and that a vegan diet is a superior alternative. This is why Food For Life Global, the world's largest feed the hungry organization, only serves plant based food. As well as Everybody Gets Fed, Earth Save and Plenty. A Well Planned Vegan Diet is Healthy According to the American Dietetic Association, America's largest organization of health care professions: ""appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes."" [9] Conclusion If we take animal welfare, the environment and world hunger into account, and ask ourselves which lifestyle is most beneficial, it seems like a vegan lifestyle is the better choice. In this paper I have provided various reasons for thinking that, and so I believe we are committed to the idea that veganism is superior. The resolution is upheld.

A chaotic situation would arise if massive change happened over night. A more gradual change could be implemented.""----- Let""s look at this gradual change idea. Suppose over the course of 20 years farming animals for food and associated industries were phased out. Now pretend 58% of a population is now employed in the renewable energy field. We are all now happy vegans with a clear conscience. Think again. What about the 30 to 40 million people of the world that are nomadic? Their existence is dependent upon raising and grazing animals for food, or they are hunter gatherers. Most of these people live in arid or snow covered regions where growing crops is not an option for survival. Are you going to put a seed in the hand of a Botswanan bushman and say plant it to eat? He""ll reply no rain, an Inuit in Greenland, Canada or Alaska, too cold. How about the Kham Magar in the Himalayas; we live above tree line. In addition to the nomadic tribes of the world, millions of others live in these regions as well. Is it ethical to shut down all their cultures and starved them out of existence for the sake of preserving animal life? ---Pro ""As for the economy there are some who think people are much healthier on a vegan diet. That health care costs would be reduced. I know in the USA health care costs keep rising.""--- There might be some lines of thinking that ""some"" people are healthier on a vegan diet. But not all people, as mentioned above. Also, many children under 5 do not do well on vegan diets. Young children on vegan diets do not obtain essential amino acids that are only available in animal proteins. Many of these children suffer from rickets and fail to thrive as a result. After reading several sites purporting vegan diets for small children, most recommended some kind vitamin supplements; obviously something is missing nutritionally from an all vegan diet for children. Is this what we want pill popping babies? Personally speaking, I""d make sure my child ate some chicken or an eggs once in a while without worrying about chicken ethics. Anyone who believes that health care cost in the US is determined by the level of health of the population at large is misinformed. We pay two-and-a-half times more than most developed nations in the world much of that has to do with 3rd party payers, much higher administrative cost, the inability to regulate fees for drugs and services, over testing due to the litigiousness of our society; as well a multitude of other factors. The $245 billion you state for diabetes testing is only 0.0245% of a 3 trillion dollar per annum industry. --Pro ""To stay on topic though the main point is vegetarians indirectly cause animal deaths. Vegetarians have animal blood on their hands. It annoys me that some hold their-selves on their high horses thinking they are so grand. If you want to save animals go vegan.

Well said, but what about taking it to a lessor extreme? For example, eating vegetarian or going out of your way to support ethical farmers.  You simply don't need to pick this particular way of helping that seems like it is difficult for you.

vegan,"I would like to thank Raisor for accepting this debate and for framing his response within the context of the Communist Manifesto which, as anybody with a social conscience will tell you, is the blueprint for a progressive and equitable meritocracy. Following the Glorious Revolution when I am duly installed as Britain's rightful dictator I will implement its recommendations in full but, in the meantime, I will explain why it is, indeed, hypocritical for a vegetarian lady to swallow her boyfriend's mess. Firstly, I dispute my opponent's claim that love custard is not a commodity: when a man spills his kids into his girlfriend's mouth the lady enjoys the experience just as much as he does [1]. Obviously she doesn't pay him for this service but, nevertheless, it has value for her, and as such, gentlemen's sauce should be considered a commodity. To underline this point, although girls don't pay for sperm, fertility clinics certainly do. My opponent then referred to Marx's ""semenal work"". If I hadn't realised this misspelling was an intentional (and very clever) pun I could have pointed out that the correct spelling is ""seminal"", but I wouldn't do that because I think engaging in seminal sementics is tedious. Moving on to my opponent's argument, whilst it is true that the woman's willingness to gobble her boy off and then ""finish the job"" by swallowing his muck will ""remove antagonism"" in their relationship, it nonetheless remains the case that the girl receives sustenance from the semen, which, like most animal products, is very high in protein. [2] A vegan woman's decision not to eat meat for ethical reasons is wholly consistent with socialism but, in developed countries, being a vegetarian is a matter of choice, not a necessity. So, by choosing to swallow her sire's semen vegan women are deliberately breaking their vow not to consume animal products and are, therefore, hypocrites. [1] I expect.

vegan,"Pro claims sperm is a commodity because of the value a lady (or man or transgender or animorph) places on it. But a thing having value does not make it a commodity. I appreciate the sun, moon, stairs, and rain [1] but these things are not commodities – commodities are things which can be bought and sold and owned. Pro has a point that fertility clinics buy sperm- If a vegan went to a clinic, bought a vial of sperm, and threw it back like a vodka shot it may be hypocritical. Yet even in this case the man freely gave this sample- unlike the forceful coercion of animals. But the resolution is about swallowing after oral sex, not clinics- a situation where no commercial transaction occurs. Pro avoids engaging in seminal sementics, sementing my victory by ignoring the intellectual girth and thrust of Marx. Pro rightfully points out that swallowing semen is beneficial to women’s health due to its high protein content, it also reduces risk of breast cancer [2]. But vegans object to the ethical content of eating animal products, not the protein content. Pro misses the jizt of my argument. An analogy: suppose I say “I am ethically opposed to slapping babies and so will not slap babies.” Then one day I see a baby choking on… semolina pasta. I slap the baby on the back, dislodging the food. No one would accuse me of being a hypocrite because I did not violate the ethical spirit of my pledge. In the same way, cum guzzling does not violate the ethical spirit of veganism. Finally, extend my argument that semen drinking solves class disparity- as Pro concedes. This means that when swallowing her sire’s sperm, a vegan is solving the class inequality she objects to by rejecting the social inequality between man and beast. Swallowing is an act that helps bridge that inequality. [1] Even my literary references are sperm puns!

vegan,"Time to finish this. I. Cross-Examination Goodness, where to begin. My opponent's stubbornness baffling. He ignores my counters and continues to cling to a broken argument. I guess I'll have to give the same response I've delivered multiple times even though now he has forfeited the ability to refute them. My opponent opens with points that he provides no examples for. The first being my lack of understanding of AI consuming energy. The second being that I didn't address his ""Wylted's Wager"". For one, notice the statement my opponent makes about his sources. The only thing his sources show is that there is an AI in development that would have moral compass. Everything after that is only his own speculation which I did in fact counter, allow me to do so again. ""The AI might not care where it gets energy from, it just wants energy."" The first claim uses 'might' implying speculation and not objectivity. Where has it been supported that an AI 'wants' energy? "" It could potentially create a technology that consumes all matter on the planet just to feed it and make it grow even stronger and smarter."" 'Potentially'? Where's the proof it will? Not provided by Pro that's for sure. ""but would have a hard time justifying consuming a vegan. Remember it needs justification to overcome the friendly AI program written in it."" Why would it have a harder time consuming vegan? The reasons are not provided. If it needs justification to consume then what's it's justification to eat carnivores? That they eat life? Vegans eat life too. Didn't I also say that our justification could be that we mainly eat herbivores? In that case vegans are at a greater risk. I stand by my claim the Wylted's Wager has no place in this debate. Pro has failed to explain how a Super AI developing would relate to immortality, the only thing he provided was an opinion saying that immortality 'may' be achieved by 2045 but this is irrelevant. The whole premise of his wager is not explained nor concluded. What point is being made? Why is immortality infinite happiness? How is immortality gained by becoming vegan to avoid robotic consumption? So many unanswered questions. From what Pro has argued he continues to leave the following questions unsupported by observable evidence. How can we know that the upcoming super AI will 'likely' 1. Be able to consume matter 2. Be able to consume humans 3. Justify not eating vegans? What is the justification for eating everything except Vegan homo-sapiens? Vegans eat life just like omnivores. Omnivores commonly eat herbivores like chicken. So omnivores could say eat vegans because they're herbivores. How can one gain immortality by being vegan not getting eaten by AI? Why does AI desire to consume matter? That is not inherent among all things on Earth, only living things. II. Closing statement The reason I counter Pro's claims with so many questions is simply because he explains so little. All Wylted has done is assume potential possibilities might maybe happen. Not good enough.",CON,Not provided by Pro that's for sure. ... Not good enough.,485
vegan,"The chuckle continues as I see a man so haughty as Wylted deliver such a poor argument. Relying on me to not catch obvious flaws and trying to force a ridiculous idea into his rebuttal. Allow me to explain. I. Cross-Examination "" I've used citations from some of the world's leading experts on AI, and yet my opponent refuses to refute them. If experts working in these fields believe a super AI is inevitable in our lifetime, why does my opponent disagree?"" My apologies, I must've just failed to see how these sources supplement Pro's position. Let's start with the first one. http://www.smithsonianmag.com...... Here, Pro tries to support his case by showing that 'Super AI' has the potential to go rogue. However, I see no connection. Pro is trying to show that this intelligence will one day desire human meals, and will base said desire off of whether the entre'e is vegan or not. Here's the problem, a robot going off it's chain and revolting would in no way entail it being hungry for human nor care for the dietary habits of a human. I'm not denying we will ever see Super AI or that said AI will become a problem, I'm merely questioning how this happening would cause carnivorous robots. Onto the another source he uses, http://www.simulation-argument.com... This source suffers from the same problem as the rest of Wylted's argument. It is highly suggestive, not empirical. Merely explaining the possibility of a situation, is not proving said situation. Again, even if we are in a simulated environment, there is absolutely nothing showing that we are being observed/tested for moral capabilities. There lacks observable evidence showing this happening and therefore lacks a reason for fear not being vegan. ""What's the worst likely thing that can happen if you become vegan.(?) If an unfriendly super AI never develops, the worst thing that happens is that you have transitioned to a healthier diet "" #1. Is that a question? #2. There are many cons to becoming vegan. Such as: -Buying more expensive food - Lacking large amounts of complete protein (especially a problem for muscle builders who require substantial amounts) -Resisting the natural urge to eat meat -No longer being able to enjoy animal-based meals -Forced into Eating food that is unpalatable (Up to individual opinion) #3. This is irrelevant to the resolution. The resolution suggests the reason for going vegan is the benefit of not being the dinner of 'super AI' not for health reasons ""It's beyond common sense that veganism is more humane. So the worst thing that happens if my scenario is false is still a bunch of good stuff, but if I'm right and an unfriendly super AI develops, what you'll experience after this ""singularity"" is immortality. http://www.thatsreallypossible.com...; Again, completely irrelevant. My opponent being wrong and ""good"" stuff happening doesn't explain why Veganism should be put to practice as a result of Super AI. His source is once again speculation. Out of words again.

vegan,"Thank you Con for presenting your arguments. Con stated in the rules at the beginning of the debate that I will not be allowed to argue in round 5. For that reason, this will be my last round to post arguments for this debate. Nature Con says that if I'm going to claim that eating animals is morally wrong, I need to provide a reason for why that is the case. In my first round of arguments of this debate, I said that it's morally wrong because it involves animal exploitation. These animals are forced to live a life full of pain and suffering. Not only that, but they are also killed prematurely at the slaughterhouse. Now, one may ask, why is it wrong to inflict pain on sentient animals? I would say it's wrong because pain is a sensation whose absence is intrinsically desired. Why is it wrong to kill sentient animals prematurely? It's wrong because it deprives them of a valuable future it could have, and thwarts the current desires they have like desires for food, sex, and being outside on a warm day. Con says that our ancestors ate meat for a long time, and that they needed to do so for survival. This is more of a statement of fact rather than an argument. However, it seems like Con is saying that because our ancestors ate meat for a long time, it is therefore morally justified. This line of argument is a fallacy, because it's an appeal to tradition. In the U.S., owning African Americans as slaves used to be a tradition. But does that mean owning other human beings was justified? No, clearly not. In the same way, just because we have been eating animals for a long time does not mean that we should continue to do so. Nutrition It's true that meat provides vitamin B12, and that this nutrient is of extreme importance. However, vegans can obtain vitamin B12 from taking a supplement or eating foods fortified with it. So meat eaters don't actually have an advantage here when it comes to B12. Con may object that if vegans have to supplement or eat foods fortified with this nutrient, this means that a vegan diet is unnatural. However, this argument would be an appeal to nature fallacy. Just because something is natural or unnatural does not mean it's good or bad. Many of the things we do nowadays could be considered unnatural. Driving a car, flying in an airplane, using a cell phone, debating others online, ect. could all be considered unnatural. As registered dietitians Jack Norris and Virginia Messina point out in their book ""Vegan for Life."" ""Today's commercial plant foods and meat are different from the foods available in prehistoric times. We eat hybrids of plants and we feed foods to animals that they would not normally eat. Additionally, the U.S. food supply is routinely fortified with a host of vitamins and minerals. Even those people who strive to eat a more ""natural"" diet as adults have normally benefited from fortified foods as children. It is quite unlikely that anyone is eating a natural diet in today's world."" [1] I'm still not convinced that meat is a superior source of protein. Meat has cholesterol, saturated fat, and no fiber in it. However, a cup of cooked lentils has 18 grams of protein, fiber, no cholesterol, and is under 1 gram of fat. [2] Veganism is Kinder Towards Animals Con says we were designed to be omnivores since the beginning. It's true that human beings are omnivores, however, we are not obligate omnivores. We can be healthy without eating animal products. They are not necessary for good nutrition. Veganism is Better For The Environment Con asked me how animals produce more greenhouse gases than all of transport. To put it simply, the world's 1.5 billion cows and billions of other grazing animals emit dozens of polluting gases, including lots of methane. [3] Methane is produced by farting and belching cows. So, since we raise huge amounts of animals for food each year, and each of them produces polluting gases, it's not hard to see how they would produce more than transport. In sum, a lot of animals, a lot of polluting gases, equals serious problems for the environment. Conclusion Overall, I think I have shown how a vegan lifestyle is better than a meat eating one. It's better for the animals, will provide more food for hungry people, and is better for the environment. This would all be true even from the perspective of the individual instead of society. Finally, thank you Con for a enjoyable debate.

vegan,"Before I start, I would like to point out that several of my arguments were dropped. ""and it provides us with helpful things like protein."" So your saying we should kill animals, kill the environment, and make people over-seas further impoverished for protein??? As for osteoporosis, animal protein contributes to this problem because keeping blood and tissues at a neutral Ph balance always takes priority over keeping calcium phosphate in the bones. Bones can hold out for years with insufficient calcium, but blood and tissue cannot because they need phosphate to offset the acidity. When the body becomes acidic with animal protein, it withdraws calcium phosphate from the bones and uses the alkaline mineral phosphate to keep the Ph levels of blood and tissues balanced. The calcium is then excreted through our urine. Epidemiological evidence proves that people who consume the least amount of animal protein always have the lowest rates of osteoporosis and bone fractures. I'm still looking for the first medical report in history that can indict broccoli, bananas or asparagus as a cause of illness. As for diabetes, most people are unaware that fat raises blood sugar as much as stress, refined carbohydrates and sugar! Since fat and animal protein go hand-in-hand, diabetes can be treated, controlled or cured with lots of cardio exercise, a minimum amount of stress, and a low-protein, low-fat, low-sugar, low-refined-carbohydrate vegan diet. A 2013 study also showed that marijuana is of great benefit to diabetics. As you regain control of your blood sugar, you will probably have to continue taking insulin shots for a time. However, within one year, you should be able to do away with insulin completely! (Pig serum used to be the key ingredient in insulin until doctors discovered it exacerbated foot neuropathy and ocular issues. All insulin is now made synthetically from human insulin.) "" It's too bad they don't speak our language"" Actions speak louder than words... ""My point is that because we are not able to beat some animals in one on one fights we developed brains to help us build tools. This in turn helped us be able to beat these animals."" Are you saying it is because we suck at fighting we got bigger brains? ""This means we aren't herbivores. It is fairly simple."" As I said earlier, classification is based on how the animal is BUILT. We are built 100% like a herbivore. It is fairly simple. ""Meat, when prepared in the right way (which we can do because of our traits! Evolution at work.)"" Preparing food is a learned behavior NOT an evolutionary trait. "" is not poisonous to humans. Compare this to chocolate. If you eat to much chocolate, you can die. It is good and bad for you at the same time. Yet still, I do not see you arguing about getting rid of all chocolate. Everything can have negative side effects but that does not mean we should ban them. Also, in case you were arguing that the animal itself could kill us, pigs and cows are not violent creatures."" You can say the same thing for smoking. What is your point? ""Finally, even if you believe that consumption of animals is wrong, cows, pigs, and other animals we eat are domesticated and rely greatly on us to survive. "" How do we rely on animals as food to live? A pound of beef is $15.05 and a pound of soy is $2.75 ""If we stopped using them for food, we would not have a really good reason to continue keeping them in our care and feeding them with our resources. If we let them out into the wild they probably would die, and if we kept them here we would be wasting money keeping them alive, when there is no longer a market for them."" So based on your logic we should eat all our pets. What use are they to us? Most would die if we let the go. Societies that exploit animals for food are the main cause of world hunger because they feed a disproportionate percentage of the world's crops to 60 billion land animals annually killed by the meat, dairy and egg industires worldwide and tens of billions of marine animals (yes, we have fish farms nowadays)""instead of 7.5 billion people on the planet! Do the math. You don't have to be Einstein to figure out this equation. Every 2-3 seconds some human (most likely a child) starves to death, while pigs and cows continually get fat. Even the Council for Agriculture Science and Technology, a group comprised of people involved in animal agriculture, acknowledges that 10 billion people could be fed with the available crop land in America if everyone became vegan. One acre of land can yield 30,000 pounds of carrots, 40,000 pounds of potatoes or 50,000 pounds of tomatoes. However, one acre of land can yield only 250 pounds of meat. Why? Depending on the animal in question, it takes from three to twenty pounds of vegetable protein to create one pound of animal protein. Thus it has been said in many places that animal agriculture works like ""a protein factory in reverse."" However, not only does this process squander protein resources; it obliterates carbohydrates and fiber, antioxidants, phytochemicals, and many other nutrients altogether.

vegan,"There are three things this debate comes down to: Impacts, evidence, and the morality/justice debate Let's start line by line First my opponent claims animal cruelty is never justified. I agree, but I also made the distinction in the first round between suffering and death, and my opponent has clearly conceded that there are moral alternatives to the pro case. Farming reform through legislation being amongst the best options. It has nothing to do with cattle ranchers or grass fed cows, but true reform that makes farming smarter and more sustainable. Then my opponent attempts to discredit my Farlie link but completely overlooks it's most important arguments. Farlie cannot compare numbers because this country has never been on an all vegan diet and secondarily, Farlie discusses that the amount needed to plot that much vegetation and sustain it so it does not endanger consumers is not feasible. There are multiple warrants but I have limited characters and highly suggest that voters read the article for themselves. Next my opponent says let's not speculate about the future and I agree, for the last round it's a waste of characters. Then my opponent claimed that a majority of my environmental impacts should be disregarded because the pro case is exclusive to the first world. Here's where my opponent makes a major contradiction because then the impacts of justice and morality are completely taken away. If the pro case can act as an entity that has the power to gradually abolish meat in ALL first world countries, then choosing not to do the same in other parts of the world means my opponent is in a double bind that I discussed in round two. Then, I win the morality debate by at least keeping the status quo which would actually be more morally sound. That is where my opponent was confused in this debate. In addition, my opponent has yet to answer any of my environmental warrants to what a vegan first workd is probelmatic such as water usage (mildly contested but never had any evidence or warrants to back it up) , amount of healthy and available land, amount of output required, and many of my links from the first round have also been overlooked. If anything, I don't need to win economy because I've already proved there is more than enough evidence that the plan will fail. It's sad that I was never able to get into a really good warrant debate about the environment. The only claim made that tried to challenge mine was that grain is composite or, but my opponent overlooks the fact that the amount of grain the U.S. produces is also unsustainable and would contradict efforts to create a absolute vegetarian diet in this country. As for humane washing, it really is of no issue in this debate round. As long as impacts like black markets, second and third world countries lack of vegan diet, and inability to have sustainability outweigh it, there is no need to consider it as a major impact in the round. In answer to Mercola, 1) he's a member of ACN, ANA, IABDM, and multiple health organizations that at least give him the minimum requirements necessary to be a credible source. If you don't want to accept that, then there is still no issues because the health debate is almost non existent at this point. In answer to healthy homes the article talks about how when we industrialize plants, we will lose diversity. That's a serious issue because bio diversity is key to survival. I strongly encourage voters to read these articles, from both debaters, so you gain a better understanding of how the impact debate favors the con. Finally my opponent made two comparisons. First they compared animals understanding of justice to comatose patients understanding of it, and as much as I find it problematic use that example, it does prove my point; animals have no mental capacity to underrand justice. Next they compared justice outweighing the economy to the injustice of slavery. First of all, there are many published articles about capitalism and the incentive to improve the economy one of the most prominent reasons that the civil war was successful. I don't know if I can post new evidence since it's the last round but if you'd like an article or multiple articles comment and id be happy to provide them to you. Second, to compare the justice of freeing slaves to the justice of freeing animals is an insult to many people. Slavery is a human rights issue, becoming a vegan is not under any circumstance one that falls under that same category (for obvious reasons). Here is the link to the animals will be worse off argument: https://medium.com... My final statement is this: I have proved that the environment, the economy, and even the morality of our world will under no circumstance be improved with the pro case. To make it easy and simple, my opponent failed to correctly refute my best piece of evidence which talks about how animals would, if anything, be in more danger.

vegan,"It's funny that such arguments would come from a person who only feeds their dog vegetables. You use the term ""animals"" as though all animals are omnivores. Of course, it is a well known fact that most animals are vegans. Take the mighty lion for example. It only eats fresh raw fruits and vegetables such as zebra and buffalo. Vegetables have all the vitamins and minerals that you've mentioned. Maybe B12 is lacking, but google ""durianride"" to find oout about vegan B12 supplements. Most human beings, meat-eaters or not, have a B12 deficiency. Vegetables and fruits are also rich in nutrients that you can never find in meat... such as chicken and beef. You can only find chicken and beef in vegetables and fruits. Cheese is another example of an essential nutrient nowhere to be found in meat and dairy.

vegan,"""I will not argue that a vegetarian diet is healthy or in practice attainable for human heath but, you fail to connect that such practice is ethical. Presently you tout animal ethics is preferable without regard to the cascading effects that would precipitate greater harm against the human that is also an animal."" Con An interesting point of view. Indeed there is vested interest in the meat industry. Yet, this doesn't mean change has to happen overnight. A chaotic situation would arise if massive change happened over night. A more gradual change could be implemented. As for the economy there are some who think people are much healthier on a vegan diet. That health care costs would be reduced. I know in the USA health care costs keep rising. ""$245 billion: Total costs of diagnosed diabetes in the United States in 2012"" diabetes.org To stay on topic though the main point is vegetarians indirectly cause animal deaths. Vegetarians have animal blood on their hands. It annoys me that some hold their-selves on their high horses thinking they are so grand. If you want to save animals go vegan.

vegan,"Thank you for responding. I am aware of the somewhat pretentious and audacious attitude of my argument, but it is just to provoke a response and give me something to argue that is quite difficult, as it is an uncustomary point of view. Everybody I know is a meat-eater, and I don't sit in my room alone hiding from the world. What my frail attempt at humor is trying to say is that I don't think meat eaters are stupid. Nor are they ignorant to anything else but life (life being the earthlings). They may be very good at lots of things, and not ignorant to everything else, but they MUST be ignorant to life (UNLESS they are more selfish or less caring than the vegans). Your argument. "" I am sure there are many biologists, gastroenterologists, vets, and pro animal rights people who eat meat, me falling under the last one. Being at least one of the things on the preceding list should disqualify ignorance as a reason for eating meat."" I agree. If these people are not ignorant to the suffering of the meat industry then IGNORANCE can be crossed of the list. These people must, therefore, be either more selfish (they care more about their own needs than others) or less caring (care less for the suffering of others) than those who choose to not support it. Your argument. In a nutshell, you said ""Simply put, humans are selfish"" I agree. But there are differing levels of selfishness. We cannot accept responsibility, as individual people, born into a corrupt, earth destroying species/society. We make our own choices because that's all we can do, Gandhi said ""be the change you want to see in the world"". I believe this. Every cultural norm was held in place by the mentality you have just revealed to me. If everybody was like you, the world would still be trading slaves. My goal in life is to play my part in ending the suffering of the world, and I know I wont succeed, but I will die trying. So you may say humans are selfish but I don't believe we are. I think the reason suffering continues is because good men fail to act. (I know that's already been spoken lol). I don't expect everybody to be a revolutionary but eating meat when you are aware of the suffering must involve some sense of selfishness. One of the comments admits to being a bit selfish. Your argument is basically that everybody is selfish. I would say that all life is selfish, but we have the capacity to not be selfish. As a whole we are selfish, but individually we don't have to be. Not everybody is, those who are aware of the suffering and still choose to support it are acting more selfishly than those who also aware, but choose to not enjoy meat in order to not support it. I don't see how anyone could disagree. Meat eaters just want it both ways, i.e to be seen as good, aware people and also to take material pleasure at the expense of a creature. You say. ""I am a more selfish, less caring person than you are because I have different eating choices?"" Well when you put it like that and just ignore the consequences of the eating choices it sounds like i am crazy. You could say that about anything, like ""I am bad just because I have different recreational choices?"" when the recreational choice is dog fighting. So no, its not because you choose to eat different food, its because you support the suffering and murder of fellow earthlings purely for pleasures of the flesh. (no pun intended). You would not support it if you didn't have to give up meat would you? You know you would say to shut them factories down if you didn't have to give up your steak. Be honest with yourself. For the record, we don't have different eating choices, I absolutely love meat (Chicken,beef,lamb,duck,pork,bacon,salmon,pigeon you name it) and I am a chef so I love to cook and I love meat with every meal. I am a vegan now though. So I have pretty much had to give up my true pleasure in life in order to align my life with my soul.

vegan,"I will accept your argument on the CON side meaning my stance is meat is as good if not better for your health, for the earth, and for humanity then the vegan diet. Meat contains high amounts of protein. Protein is essential for the function of muscles and bones. The consumption of animal protein is associated with increased muscle mass, meaning people who eat a meat diet tend to have more muscle then a vegan diet. Studies show that consumption of protein is beneficial to increased bone density meaning with old age as your bones get weaker animal protein will help conserve bone mass. Meat is also nutritious; 3.5 ounces of raw ground beef contains large amounts of B12, Creatine, Carnosine, and DHA and EPA; these nutrients can not be found in vegetables. B12 is important because it cannot be found in plants, studies looked at vegans who don’t get B12 in their normal diet and 92% of them were deficient. Creatine reserves energy for the brain and for muscle movement, people who are deficient have reduced physical and mental performance. Carnosine is a powerful anti-oxidant which provides protection against many degenerative processes. DHA and EPA refer to Omega-3. It is easier than having to have specific plant based diet to just eat meat to acquire your nutrients. Meat eating is good for the environment because the raising of cattle if grass fed is good for the health of the soil and the grass. The eating of the grass stimulates vegetative growth. Also the trampling of hoofs and digestive tracts promote seed germination and nutrient recycling. There have been claims that the farts of the cattle is one of the leading causes to Green house gases. According to the Environmental Protection Agency in 2010; all of the U.S. agriculture accounts for 8% of green house emissions. The majority of the emissions are from crop farming because of the crop and soil management. Union concerned scientists reported that only about 2% of the green house gasses are connected to cattle farming. (http://www.wsj.com...) Finally meat is good for humanity. If you look at our history we are omnivores we eat meat and plants. It is in biological adaption to be able to eat meat and plants while taking in the nutrients. Humans have much shorter digestive systems than herbivores meaning we don’t have adapted organs to digest cellulose. This means we are not able digest the main fiber in plants. Humans also have canine teeth, thumbs, and a brain, which shows that we are evolutionarily supposed to eat meat because all three of those factors make us hunters. In conclusion eating meat is more convenient and easier then trying to get all vital nutrients from just vegetables and vitamins.",CON,Meat eating is good for the environment because the raising of cattle if grass fed is good for the health of the soil and the grass. ... The majority of the emissions are from crop farming because of the crop and soil management.,494
vegan,"You argue that we are not obliged to become vegan. Well do you believe that a parent is obliged to look after their child? And if so, on what grounds is that obligation legitimised? Well I will tell you: because that child is only there as a result of their actions, and because making him unhappy is simply 'not nice'. So how do we define obligation? Well it seems that righteousness and kindness play a big role. For instance, are you obliged to help someone who is going to die without a small, easy action on your behalf? These are difficult questions, because they have two equally TRUE responses. Those are as follows: No, because 'obligation' is it's self is mearly a word. The idea of Right and Wrong is only an idea, made by a collection of neurons in so called 'biological organism'. And so we have no obligation to do the 'right' thing because all that matters is our individual desires. This is true. However it may not be true if God exists. But non the less, without evidence of God, we cannot bring him into the discussion. So if we go off all we know, that being that we are all biological organisms that have a life span, and desires, we can say we have no obligation to anything. We merely do what we please. Now, on the other side of the argument, we say YES: we do have an obligation to look after our children, do the kind thing e.t.c. In this response, we legitimise obligation by what we call 'righteousness'. So we are obliged to do something because it is right. Although both response are equally correct (besides not doing the 'right' thing if God is real) I live by the second one. So when you say: ""I argued that not everyone is obliged to become vegan"" your are correct, we are not necessarily obliged to be vegan. But by that same logic, we are also not obliged to do anything, thus rendering the word meaningless. The voters will have too decide how they substansiate their own obligations: either through righteousness, or selfishness. You say: -Pro has not explained the morality bit of his argument. How is it immoral to provide your population with food? My friend this is foolish. Did I say it was immoral to provide your population with food? I don't understand this point. Indeed I have actually explained why producing meat costs far more than other food, so your ideology is the one that provides less food if anything. It is not immoral to provide your population with food: it's immoral to make billions of fellow beings suffer horrifically in order to achieve that goal, when other options are just as easy to take. Your next argument actually links with your first one. You say: ""are we obligated to be unnatural?"" Suggesting that we are not obligated to be unnatural. Well like I said, it links to the first point: are we obliged to do the right thing, or the natural thing? Like I say in the beginning: I argue that we are obliged to do the right thing, regardless of our own desires or 'natural instinct'. For instance: we don't instinctively want to do the 'right' thing as humans, indeed instinctively we want to do the selfish thing. I would argue that doing the right thing is hard and often requires us to act in ways that we don't want too. You are saying that if we don't want to do it, then why should we? I think as an intelligent beings, we should have higher standards than this animalistic attitude my opponent is portraying of selfish gain. So yes, we ARE obliged to act unnaturally (whatever that actually means), if it means we are doing the 'right' thing. I say in the wild, animals are hunted fairly. For instance a tiger has to stalk its prey, she will have to single out a weak member of the herd, then she will chase it and there is a very high possibilty that she will fail to catch. She tries so hard because without the catch, her young will starve. You see, they cannot eat the fruits and vegetables of the trees like we can, nor can they plough the fields and bake the bread. Now when we eat meat, we don't chase anything that can survive. These animals are born into in. They have no chance of escape, or no chance of a peaceful life. And you say: -It's actually very natural. Even animals do it. Tigers have claws and sharp teeth. That's not fair for the prey they hunt. Yet they hunt and eat their prey for their own survival. Are you really comparing claws to factory farms? You say: -Actually, the fact that our ancestors did it is enough to justify it. If our ancestors did not develop tools to hunt and had a vegan diet, they would have gone extinct and we would not exist today. Our ancestors needed to hunt and kill animals for their survival back when they were hunter-gatherers. Vegetation alone is not enough and killing animals gave them more benefits than just food. If our ancestors had not hunted mammoths, they would have had no shelter and clothes, leaving them to freeze in the Ice Age. Yes, in the ice age. We are not in the ice age anymore. Necessities change over time. The British empire and USA may not have been without slavery, does this mean we shouldn't condem it? Women have been oppressed throughout history, without it, things would not be how they are now: does this mean we shouldn't move towards removing that ancestoral habit? You say ""the fact our ancestors did it is enough to justify it"" I simply believe this to be absolutely foolish. This mentality of yours, is the reason society takes so long to change socially. I'm upset because you are intelligent and yet still think this way. You say: ""I think most the population knows they are eating dead animals"" They do know they are dead animals, but I am saying that they are ignorant to their actual circumstances. They do not know how much they suffer. And so, the fact that people are accepting of it is not cause to legitimise it, as they do not know what is actually going on. The repetitive stress evidence: You say: -If everyone was vegan, those workers would be out of a job. I'm certain most slaughter house workers would much rather kill animals so that they can support their families than to lose their jobs and their right to eat meat. Should we of kept slavery too then, to ensure the slave merchants kept their jobs? Because according to your logic, we should never improve the society because of short term consequences. You must not be so short sighted. Besides, I said we should MOVE towards a world where we are all vegan. I am saying that we should gradually move towards that world, and that it should be seen as an ideal to AIM for. I am not saying we should force the world to be like that over-night. As I said: is a movement towards such a world. You say about my quote (true test of a man is how he treats his inferiors e.c.t.) that is could be interpreted in other ways and so it doesn't support my claim. Well no, not really. So your suggesting that he may of meant that treating his inferiors badly, is the true test of a mans virtue? Don't be absurd, it's obvious what he meant. He meant: treating your inferiors well, suggests that you are virtuous because you have less consequences for doing so. Thus, you are treating them well because you are compassionate, and not because of selfish or other reasons. You argue that making someone suffer is okay when they are a rapist or murderer. Yes okay, so if someone has committed the worst offences imaginable then they maybe deserve to suffer. What offence has the animal committed? No the environment would be helped. It takes 100x more clean water to make meat, it costs about ten times the weight of grain to get an amount of meat. There is no question about whether the meat industry is bad for the environment. Please look at these websites. I am not trying to argue that it's bad for the environment, I'm assuming we already know this, I'm using it as an argument. There is no question about its truth, the question is only about whether its sufficient enough as a reason to go vegan. You say that the water is going to be used on the cows anyway. This is ridiculous, if we don't eat cows why would so many of them exist? Obviously in a vegan world there would be less cows to spend drinking water on. So it would save water. Water is an issue actually, maintining clean drinking water. You say the animals will take up the room anyway even if the world was vegan. Why? Why would we continue to breed animals on such a scale if we stopped using them? Who would pay to feed and keep them? Think about it. They would either be killed of just aloud to die in peace and breed no more young animals. You say health and happiness are not linked. Well, they are. A well nutritified body is a well functioning one, a well functioning brain and body means that there is stability. If you eat loads of food that is bad for your health, you will be less happy. For instance you will get ill more often, you will die earlier and you may not feel energetic and content. For food is our medicine, and we are what we eat. You say you won't be happy because you can't eat certain meals, well you need to find other ways of being happy. If such a shallow, pleasure of the flesh is you source of happiness then you should study philosophy and the real truth behind happiness. Happiness is more likely to come from compassion to life, rather than a rejection and abuse of life, would you not agree? Do you get your authority from others my friend? So we are only obliged to abolish slavery because of the 'human rights'? So, before this paper was written, slavery was okay yer? My friend this is foolish. People don't have very different ideas about being good, it's all based around kindness and compassion. Most meat-eaters are brave enough to accept their faults, some like yourself want to have your cake and eat it. You want to be seen as virtuous and good, and you support cruelty for your own pleasure. Just accept it, you are doing the wrong thing, you cannot have it both ways.

vegan,"Thanks for the debate, Pro. Rebuttals ============ 1. Nature It seems that Pro is linking animals to slaves. This is not a good comparison, and this is why. Animals are treated with RESPECT. Crazy, right? After all, the big manufacturers treat the animals poorly. Ask any farmer who is not part of a big manufacturer and they would say they care for their animals, even though they are to be killed anyway. Even some farmers who are part of large manufacturers love their animals, and they think they shouldn't be treated like so, some even quit because of this. Animals are still LOVED, they are not viewed as ""mere commodities"". Second, food. Did we need slaves to survive? No, it was just a way to be lazy. Animals can be FOOD, it isn't bad for you and it certainly has nutritional value. We ate it for SURVIVAL, slaves were used just for making things easier, and they weren't treated with respect. Yes, there could be improvements to the current system, but how does this benefit the individual? It doesn't, it doesn't. 2. Nutrition Pro forgets one key aspect. Pro keeps arguing how eating vegetables and fruits is healthy, we need to remember that having a omnivore diet means eating vegetables and fruits too. As I explained in round 4, you get all the nutritional value of fruits and vegetables, and get all the benefits from eating meat as well. Why trouble yourself into trying to find a source of protein and all the nutritional things in meat in a vegan diet, if you could just change to a healthier omnivore diet( (eating more fruits and vegetables)? 3. Veganisim is Better for the environment Do we need electronics to survive? Do we really need online debate sites? Do we need big cities or schools to survive? No, they aren't necessary, but they are EXTREMELY beneficial. We could live without all these things, it's possible, but it's better if we do have them. Same thing goes with meat, we don't need meat, but it is extremely beneficial. Remember, you will still be eating vegetables and fruits, and you will benefit from meat too. 4. Veganisim is better for the environment So, if we let ALL of them free, will that help? At least in farms they get food, and their waste gets cleaned up. Imagine how bad it would be if we let them free. A lot of natural resources would be depleted, there would be overcrowding due to the mass amount of animals., and there will be a lot of gases being thrown into the atmosphere. In fact, there might be even MORE, because there's no one to clean it up. All in all, it would be more disastrous for everyone if we just let all of them free. Conclusion ============= I stand firmly on the position that an omnivore diet is better than a vegan one for the individual. You get all the nutrition from fruits and vegetables, AND you get the added bonus from the meat (Not to mention having one of the tastiest parts of the meal). It is just better and more nutritious (that's vague, but that's all I can think of). I believe I have successfully countered my opponents arguments, and that my arguments stay standing.

vegan,"First, some clarifications I think I should start off by saying what I am arguing against. According to Merriam-Webster, vegan is defined as: a person who does not eat any food that comes from animals and who often also does not use animal products (such as leather). So pro has the burden of proof to prove that not eating meat at all, or even using any animal products for any means is inherently better for the environment. And since he did not say who specifically is eating vegan, I will also argue that it isn't for entire communities everywhere, but for specific people. I will also include myself in that category. My thesis says it is neither better nor worse, depending on how you handle the process of growing the food. While bad farming practices can lead to damaging environmental side effects; a person can be concious of that enough to choose to eat meat in a way that is good for the environment, and not damaging at all. Some rebuttals: Cows are ruining our forest cover Pro has stated that deforestation is a problem inherent to meat supplies. While this can be true, it isn't necessarily a thing that can't be handled. The problem with deforestation is not planting enough trees to replace them in time. In fact, most of the heavily forested are making a comeback[1][2]. Places with plenty of agriculture like the United States have now have much more forest area by acerage than we had even a decade ago[3]. This is attributed to the much slow on the rate of deforestation of rain forest considerably, as well as the planting of huge swaths of forest due to conservation efforts[1]. This rapid growth of the forests, tied with really bad forest planning has actually contributed a lot to the forest fire concerns[4]. Since many nations who happened to have big increased in cattle have also had big increases in forestation in the same nation, I don't think deforestation is necessarily a problem that cannot be planned around and avoided all together... And thus the oxygen supply is safe. Grain stores for cows Pro made bad comparison to grain enough to feed 9 billion people. The number isn't relevant if it can be done sustainably, and it wasn't linked to an actual finite number of how much we can support. But I want to go beyond just that. Can 9 million people really live off that grain alone? The problem with the comparison is that to live the vegan lifestyle, grain would not give you near enough protein, etc for that. You need a wide variety of fruits and vegetables to get the nutrients you need to live off of. So no, 9 billion people could not live off that. It could certainly help give 9 billion people a staple meal in the world, but they would still be malnourished. Water Supplies Pro has also stated we cannot support the plants we need to also support a meat industry. This is under the faulty assumption we can't fix our water issue seperately. For instance, Israel, someone who exports massive amounts of produce to places like europe and Russia[5], gets a huge amount of water from the mediterranean, and is a pioneer in desalination plants [6]. They use drip methods to give just the right amount of water to their farm plants, without being wasteful[7]. If the proper motivation and funding went into forging sustainable water supplies for the world, we have so much water in the world where we can more than sustain everyone many times over. This is a case of mismanagement and going full steam ahead, but not something that cannot be addressed for the population who may want to eat meat, and have enough water supplies in the future. Cattle/Grain Effiency This is an irrelevant thing to add to the discussion when we have clear up the idea of space (more on that later), and water. Because then it just doesn't matter as much. When you address those sustainably, you can then sustainably increase it to whatever levels you want to feed your cattle sustainably... Running out of Fish/Fish Farming Again, it isn't a problem when you make a sustainable system. Have you heard of aquaponics? A fish/plant/water system where they all sort of symbiotically benefit eachother, in a closed, perfectaly self-sustaining loop[8]. Now I know full well not all fish can handle that kind of diet, but many can. So if you switch to eating fish of that sort, that still isn't eating vegan. Overhunting has wiped out and driven many land species to the endangered list, or extinction. Same with overfishing. But sustainable practices and laws put in place to protect them - and many of them rebounding to the point where they were taken off the endangered species list and protection of it. This is about smart fishing practices, better practices for growing them in sustainable ways. That doesn't mean not eating them all together. Or never fishng. Just stop shooting the environment past a point where it is unsustainable, or where you are putting enough into it to become more than sustainable (ex: reforestation). Arguments For Con: Killings of Some Animals to Help Environment: We have hunted the natural enemies of the deer in North America to critical levels, and in many cases to extinction (varietes of wolf that used to exist in the eastern US, where no wolfs are anymore) have caused the deer population to explode. Like, past sustainable levels explosion, without enemies hunting them; even outside the US[9][10]. It used to be offset by human hunting, but now not as many people are hunting anymore. Deer already kill more humans than any other animal in the US. In many places it has gotten waaay to far out of hand. Cities are turning to hunters[9][10] to get rid of them. This puts food on the table, and helps the environment. Food production systems that incorporate symbiotic meat production (like chickens) There are several ways to to this, like the aquoponics earlier. But a really good one is how what I would like to call the 'adam and eve' system they demonstrate in the documentary Dirt[10], where people set up a set of legumes over the years, that eventually became a managed forest. For every problem that occurs, they simply introduce something else to the enviroment that naturally offsets it. And one of the things they even demonstrated was the introduction to the system that gave certain edible vegetables/fruits at various times of the year with little management things like chickens. They ate off stuff in the enviroment, and helped the plants grow. In turn, more of them also means more chickens/eggs to eat. So again, sustainable practices - that can go beyond veganism. Lifestyle choices of the Single Consumer A person can only choose to eat meat from farms they know they can trust, visit themselves to make sure they are doing things the right way. As someone who grew up in part on them, and been around plenty of them - I know they can be done well. I hve never been on a factory farm, so the stories I keep hearing still sound strange to my ears. There are good ones a person can choose to eat from that are not bad for the environment at all. It all depends on location, who, what, why? In conclusion: Veganism is a drastic and unnecessary chagnge, and not inherently better for the environment by itself.

vegan,"human beings have flourished on earth in vast terrains and we still do with differing food type availability. the amazon diet is very different to the eskimo diet and yet all the varying human communities omni/carnivores and herbivores have all flourished healthily whilst maintaining fundamentally differnt diets. Your examples are of omnivore diets; eskimos eat fish, and game, amazons insects, fish, livestock, and game. Being omnivores is what allows us to eat such a wide range of nutrition as a system is totally interwoven into our other bodily systems and so it is actually very incomplete to deduce that children who dont drink milk will have weaker bones or a calcium shortage. You are right. You could eat 33 cups of baby spinach, or 5 to 6 cups of cooked spinach to get the same calcium as 8 oz of milk. My point was more that no one really eat this much.

vegan,"Introduction In his opening argument my opponent presents two arguments against veganism, both of which I will address in this rebuttal. The Health Argument P1) A low carbohydrate diet is more healthy than a vegan diet P2) We should do what is healthier for our body. C1) We should adopt a low carbohydrate diet. Premise 1 ""It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.""(1) My opponent justifies this premise by listing several nutrients vegans lack. I will in response list briefly how vegans can easily reach optimal supply of them. Subpoint A Due to character limitations I am not able to respond to every single nutrient my opponent listed, but instead I focused on the three he highlighted. Vitamin B12 Con says B12 levels are always low in a vegan's serum. However his corresponding source does not even contain the words ""vitamin"" or ""B12"". As such I am left wondering where his information stems from. I propose direct supplementation and fortified breakfast cereal to counter possible shortcomings. Omega-3 Fatty Acids Here the relevant omega-3 fatty acids are DHA and EPA. Both of which can be found in fish. However it is not the fish itself producing them, it is the microalgea they eat. Again, fortified food and supplements can carry ones supply. Additionally flaxseed, flaxseed oil, canola oil, soy products, hemp products, and walnuts among other foods contain ALA, from which the human body can produce DHA and EPA (1). Iron It is true, we absorb more iron from animal than from plant based products. However vitamin C for example enhances the absorption rate of non-hem iron (3) (4). Decreasing the consumption of inhibitors, like phytates or tannins, furthers one's absorption rate even more (4). In the end drinking a glass of orange juice before every meal provides more than enough vitamin C to achieve sufficient iron supply. Foods containing large amounts of iron include various beans, tofu, fortified breakfast cereals, cashews, various seeds, spinach and lentils (5). The RDA for iron is 8 mg/day for adult men and one cup of cooked soybeans already includes 8.8mg of iron (5). Subpoint B Testosterone On the contrary, it is not the vegans and vegetarians who have significantly lower testosterone, it is the vegans who have higher testosterone than both vegetarians and meat-eaters. “""The results did not support the hypothesis that meat-eaters have higher levels of bioavailable androgens [testosterone] than non meat-eaters. No differences in hormone levels were found between meat-eaters and lacto-ovo-vegetarians, suggesting that vegetarian diets may not alter prostate cancer risk, but the relatively low IGF-I levels in vegans might reduce their risk of prostate cancer."" (5) Alzheimer's Disease I was not able to view the whole study and the abstract never said anything specifically about vegans. Therefore I will present general means to reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease Coffee contains caffeine, antioxidants, and other phytochemicals, all of which affect disease risks. Recent studies reveal that coffee helps to reduce the risk of Alzheimer's and Parkinsons's disease (6). Furthermore, it has been shown that apple juice (7) and ginger (8) also reduce the risk. Child Development From the study my opponent cited: ""The results of this study show that children can be successfully reared on a vegan diet providing sufficient care is taken to avoid the known pitfalls of a bulky diet and vitamin B12 deficiency.""(9) HDL & Heart Disease From the study my opponent cited: ""risk is reduced most effectively when trans fatty acids and saturated fatty acids are replaced with cis unsaturated fatty acids.""(10) Cis unsaturated fatty acids such as ALA. Sperm Count It should be noted that the cited study compared the semen of 471 meat-eaters and 5 vegans. It is anecdotal at best. This was a study of men who were patients at an infertility clinic. The area around the clinic is populated by the Seventh-day Adventists, so a lack of possible participants could not have been the reason for the low amount of vegetarians and vegans. It might just be because vegans are less likely to need infertility treatments. Moreover the sperm count was not low enough to raise infertility concerns, they were well within the normal range. (11) Researchers suspected B12 sufficiencies, a problem that can easily be rectified. Please understand that again due to character limitations I was no able to cover every single point made by my opponent. If you think I was to brief on some of them, keep in mind that listing deficiencies is one thing, presenting solutions is another. Subpoint C I don't advocate the lipid hypothesis and I don't know why I should have the ""burden to prove that [the] lipid hypothesis is correct"". If anything the burden is on my opponent to demonstrate why I need to support this hypothesis. Premise 2 My opponent takes this premise to be self evident, however I disagree. Ethical Self Sacrifice Consider a mother whose children are endangered or just any person saving the life of multiple others at the expense of their own. In those cases nobody in their right mind would advise the mother to do what is healthier for her body, we would praise her for her sacrifice. I do not suggest that we should never do what is good for our health by any means. However put as an universal prescription this premise is plainly false. Benefiting Others Let's pretend that veganism actually brings some minor health deficits. Perhaps you would not be able to become a top athlete anymore or would run into a slightly increased risk of becoming ill. The main motivation behind a vegan diet has always been to save the life's of innocents and veganism (dietary wise) is simply the best way of achieving this goal. Climate change among other things is a problem everyone should care about and everyone can contribute to solving. ""So I want to highlight the fact that among options for mitigating climate change, changing diets is something one should consider."" - Dr. Pachauri, chair of the IPCC () Even if I would have to sacrifice some minor things mentioned above, I can in return contribute to a truly greater goal. Why vegan? Because it sets a sign. The Permissibility Argument P1)If animals are not morally equivalent to humans, then it is okay to eat them. P2) Animals are not morally equivalent to humans. C1) It is okay to eat animals. Premise 1 Equality and Obligation If one was given the choice to either rescue a pregnant mother or an elderly man with perhaps only months left to live, then I don't think many would favor the man. The elderly man is not morally equivalent to the woman. If we were to meet him on the street however we would certainly not try to eat him if we just happen to be hungry. Even if animals are not morally equivalent to humans, it does not follow that they have no moral status. Lesser obligation is not equal to no obligation. Ecosystem Intervention I am not sure why Con brings up the conversion of carnivorous animals to support this premise. However it should be noted that human interference with an ecosystem will most likely lead to its ruin. Arguing it would be better for animals to be where they cannot be eaten or suffer from disease is the same reasoning American slave traders used to justify taking African people out of the ""dangerous wilderness"". Moral Animals My opponent claims that animals cannot comprehend morality, but this is not true. Chimpanzees disprove of wrong doings among their peers, just as packs are organized in complex social structures (). It might be true that they don't understand our morality, but we on the other hand understand theirs, at least in part, yet willfully decide to violate it. Cognitive Capacities It should again be noted that this moral nature is not something all humans poses (as I have argued in my opening statement). Why only Animals? If a bodily desire for meat justifies this premise, then I would ask: why limit yourself to non-humans? After all, we are just as capable to consume any human flesh to meet out nutritional needs (avoiding the brain and spinal cord to not risk Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease). Either we accept both meat sources or none. Premise 2 Participation and Moral Nature To refute this premise one only has to look at my opening discussion. Not even all humans can participate in ""human culture"" and yet it is not permissible to eat them. It is not clear what is meant by ""moral theory"", because I can think of at least five different normative moral theories (utilitarianism, natural law, divine command, virtue ethics, deontological ethics), all taking different stances on this issue, depending on the particular version of the corresponding theory. I would argue that because they experience pain and pleasure much like we do, we have a moral obligation towards them. Unnecessary Suffering My opponents claims animal abuse is bad not because it violates an animal's rights (nor because it causes suffering), but because it is unnecessary. But why does non-necessity amount to moral badness? If they truly are not part of ""the moral sphere"", then why should causing animals (unnecessary) suffering be bad in any way? It seems prima facie inconsistent to hold both beliefs and this demands explanation from my opponent. Conclusion The arguments Con put forward have been rebutted and I await his objections to my opening statement.

vegan,"Now that we are off the silly train I will address your points. First, 249,825 Australian individuals are employed in the farming industry. Affiliated industries such as meat packing, milk and egg production, distribution, retail and fast food employment grow the employment numbers exponentially. In the meat packing sector there are 148,000 full-time jobs that contribute 16.2 billion dollars to the Australian economy annually. $37 billion of the fast food industry contributes annually with 156,186 jobs; McDonald's, Burger King, Subway and the like. The meat industry as a whole, chicken, beef, and lamb contributes $18 million dollars a day to the Australian economy. The food animal industry contributes $16.2 billion in gross domestic product or 1.3% of total GDP. Now, you may feel that 1.3% of the GDP can be sacrificed in the name of animal ethics but, percentages do not reflect value of product. Mining and ore exports hold higher monetary value per pound than meats and animal products. But, meat production, animal products and associated industries attribute to 58% of all jobs held in Australia. In the name of animal ethics would you put that many people out of work? The unemployment and social services payouts would break the nation financially. With more than half of the Australian population unemployed, hungry and some homeless as a result; do you think a vegetarian or vegan diet is in balance with people out of work and starving? Where do animal ethics draw a line? I will not repute that cruelty exist in the farming of animals, but the sources you referenced are biased. These are organizations whose"" goal are explicit toward vegetarianism or vegan life styles and animal ethics. They do not provide statically rich information regarding cause and effect from an economic standpoint. Though their claims have some merit, upon examining economic repercussions, one must ask does animal welfare supersede human hunger due to unemployment? It is conceivable that over time that natural resource use proves that meat production and affiliated industries are too intensive to be sustainable as the global populations grows. But, given the data presently available, animal ethics and morality places human populations at greater risk for suffering if applied. Second, I believe we have defined hippopotamus. Stating that ""Some Lacto vegetarians proudly state ""I am not responsible for any animal deaths."" That's hippopotamus!"" This statement is false. Hippopotamus is under an undisputed definition: A hippopotamus one is who is faking eating egg and cheese but in fact strictly vegan. Your comment is contradictory to the definition.

vegan,"I thank my opponent for all of his arguments thus far. They have been interesting, informative, and in some cases, very hard to refute (the makings of a great argument). He has also been courteous, and I thank him for this too. I'll spend a small amount of this argument refuting his latest argument, and then I'll attempt to summarize all of my arguments; due to lack of space, many of my arguments were a bit unorganized and probably hard to follow. I'll get to it. One of con's first points is that factory farms account for only 40% of consumed meat world-wide. This is true, but it is misleading. The reason for this is that factory farming really only exists in developed countries; this is because less-developed countries tend to consume little or no meat, and the meat they do consume is typically locally produced. (http://chartsbin.com...) Of course they don't have factory farming - they consume almost no meat. In any nation where the consumption of meat and dairy is common (as in almost all developed countries), factory farming is the only viable solution. One source indicated that ""Factory farming now accounts for more than 99 percent of all farmed animals raised and slaughtered in the United States. (Virtually all seafood comes to us by way of industrial fishing or factory fish farms.)"" (http://www.farmforward.com...) You simply cannot have meat production on a large scale without factory farming. Even if all citizens boycotted factory farming and turned to locally-grown meat, these farms would soon turn into factory farms because it is the only way to keep up with demand. They simply have to grow more food in less time. There's no other solution. (After all, that's how all factory farms began - as local farms.) He argues that factory farming is not inherent in an omnivore diet, but that simply isn't true in a practical world. Unfortunately, factory farming is the only solution when any nation consumes any significant amount of meat. Therefore, the only way to truly stop factory farming is the adoption of a vegan diet. Con than states that ""Pro then contends that breeding livestock for the sake of consuming its meat is immoral in and of itself. This is merely his opinion."" Well, of course it is. The very resolution of this debate is my opinion. Every argument you or I have made is a matter of opinion. These opinions may be supported by facts, but they are still opinions. My goal in this debate is to convince the readers to agree with my opinion. Further, it is my opinion that farming to breed animals as a means to ensure their survival is not moral. Animals have survived on their own in the wild since they evolved from other organisms. This argument is baseless and easily dismissed. Con has failed to refute my assertion that exploiting animals on the basis that they are weaker than us is immoral, nor did he attempt to explain how the same idea couldn't be applied to weaker humans. Environment: ""Animal waste is also a non-issue for conventional farms due to a technique known as ""rotational grazing"". With this technique, the soil absorbs the nutrients from the animals manure thereby allowing the grass, among other crops, to grow without the aid of synthetic fertilizers [8]."" It is not true to say that this is a non-issue. Methane from cow manure is the third-leading cause of global warming (http://planetsave.com...). This is obviously greatly increased from factory farming, but the increased production of animals on any scale (even local) will continue to contribute to this. Fewer animals = less manure = less methane = less environmental damage. Con also asserts that soy and nuts are 'incomplete protein,' which is not true. It is very easy to get different sources of protein in the same meal on a vegan diet, which in turn completes the proteins and allows them to work. Over-consumption of protein is not irrelevant as con brought up lack of protein on a vegan diet in his initial argument. Health Cancer: I did provide a source that trumped con's source. However, I posted it at the end to save space and so it is understandable that con missed it. Here it is again: http://www.cancerproject.org... Tuberculosis: Con clearly did not understand what I said the first time. The study he posted indicated that vitamin D deficiencies were the cause here, not plant-based diets. The two have nothing to do with each other. Vitamin D is easily attainable with a vegan diet. Salmonella: Pro is right, although he admits that poultry is the leading cause of salmonella. Soy and cancer: Con fails to provide any evidence that the link between soy and cancer is widely accepted. He cites one page that suggests that women avoid over-consumption of soy, but this applies to everything. Over-consumption of anything, even vitamins and water, can be unhealthy. This is not inherent in soy products. B-12. I did read con's source, and he is still wrong. This source shows that fortified soy milk, nutritional yeast, and several other sources contain ACTIVE vitamin B-12: http://www.vrg.org... Therefore, con's claim that ""The only other place to get the active form of vitamin b-12 is in animal stool"" is a complete lie and distortion, and this entire argument falls apart. Conclusion: Veganism should be adopted by every able person as it benefits animals, the environment, and our health. I have shown this through statistical evidence and well-sourced empirical data. I have thoroughly refuted almost all of con's arguments and and shown many of them to be misleading or false. While some of my argument does rely primarily on factory farming, I have shown that such a method is the only viable way to produce meat and dairy in any country that consumes any significant amount of the aforementioned products. Even with moderate meat and dairy consumption, risks of cancer are high; the breeding of animals causes environmental problems, even on a small scale; the nutrients found in these products are easily found in vegan alternatives, all of which are healthier and do not require the slaughter of sentient beings that have just as much of a capacity to feel pain as you and me. There is simply no reason whatever to continue to consume animal products, besides our own selfish desires. It is no longer necessary and its only effects are negative. I have shown these effects to be negative, and (while he did not have the burden of proof here and thus did not need to make this argument, but still failed to do so) con failed to show any evidence that animal-based diets had any positive effect at all on animals, the environment, or health. Con's only rebuttals to my arguments were easily refuted. As a result, I feel that I have sufficiently supported the resolution: everyone who has the ability to adopt a vegan diet should do so. It benefits animals, it benefits us, and it benefits our planet. (Once again, I would like to thank con for his opposition. Personally, I found this argument informative, fun, and extremely interesting. Con made a good case and made good arguments, and conducted himself very well. For this, I do thank him. I also thank any readers for their time, no matter how they vote.)",PRO,"These opinions may be supported by facts, but they are still opinions. ...

vegan,"thank you for embarking on this discussion with me. human beings have flourished on earth in vast terrains and we still do with differing food type availability. the amazon diet is very different to the eskimo diet and yet all the varying human communities omni/carnivores and herbivores have all flourished healthily whilst maintaining fundamentally differnt diets. the sophisticated library of terms that modern science uses to explain our nutritional needs are just elements of raw data that is only relevant to the persons in which the effects were observed. nutrition as a system is totally interwoven into our other bodily systems and so it is actually very incomplete to deduce that children who dont drink milk will have weaker bones or a calcium shortage. the reality of the situation as is the case with most matters is the influence of financial profit. scientists ultimately only manipulate data to make it appear favourable to the goals of the organisations that fund their 'science' if a scientist was to point out that cows milk has been shown to be incompatible with the human stomache, the dairy industry would ensure that 100 other scientists rebutt or 'reinterpret' the undesirable science. large parts of indian civilisations up until the present have remained vegan for 1000s of years without any scientifically noticeable calcium deficient conditions incidentally these same people have also been reported to not spending their whole lives grazing on their vegetable curries to keep their nutritional standards in line with their omnivore brethren indeed plant life is also living. and its possible that plants feel just as much pain by our disturbing their natural life cycle. however, realistically lets start by protecting the cows and hens whose pain we can clearly perceive......then we can go searching for carrots' tears and emotions. ----------------------- apologies for any incoherent parts...........or any missing formalities..............im new to this but keen to improviing ------------------",PRO,large parts of indian civilisations up until the present have remained vegan for 1000s of years without any scientifically noticeable calcium deficient conditions incidentally these same people have also been reported to not,507
vegan,"Thank you for accepting. First I will state my arguments, then I will address your points. Overview. I am not saying we should force anyone to be vegan, meat should not be illegal to consume. I am saying that in a better version of our society, that we should hope to see in the future, eating animals should become less common. I think that the general trend of the world in getting fairer, will eventually lead to the absence of animal cruelty. Argument 1. Killing animals is not a nice thing to do, and not doing it is the right moral thing to do, for our society. People always say its natural to eat meat. True. Its not natural however, to eat the meat of any animal that has not been hunted fairly. No, it's not what our ancestors did. However even if it was what we did, this fact alone would not be sufficient in proving its righteousness, as our ancestors did many things that we would not endorse now. The only reason most people don't think it's bad, is because they don't know enough, and they dont have to do the killing. Repetitive stress is 35 times higher in slaughter house workers than manufacture workers. Also illness in more than 3 times more common amongst slaughterhouse workers than the general population. This reflects the grief and trouble that is caused to humans when they are exposed to the reality of the meat market. Even people who are 'hardened' to it. Animals suffer and we make them suffer. Also, if we have learned anything from the Zimbardo prison study, slaughterhouses are breeding grounds for abuse. Low-paid, uneducated, not exactly the most compassionate portion of the population and the presence of a sub-group of individuals in the power of the higher-group; these are all things that encourage abuse of the sub-group. In my belief, it's prevalent in every slaughterhouse to a high extent. We may not have a duty to care too non-humans creatures, but we certainly have a duty to respect our position of power and not force others to suffer. Somebody once said ""the true test of a man is in his treatment of his inferiors"". If we believe this to be true then shouldn't we treat animals better than we do now? Or do you not agree with this statement? So my first point is that it's wrong to make anyone suffer, I hope my opponent doesn't disagree with this. My second argument is that it would be better for the environment and the environment is essential. We need to look for ways of reducing greenhouse gasses. (For anyone who is unaware of the effect of eating meat on the environment, this fact will have to suffice for now: livestock and meat consumption does more damage to the environment than all the transport in the world combined.) My third argument is that it's far less taxing on the worlds resources to make plant sustenance than to raise livestock. It takes about 2,400 litres of clean water to make one pound of meat. In comparison with 20 or so litres for a pound of grain. Also it takes far more food to feed the livestock than they produce. Livestock take up more land than humans! About 30% of our earth we devote to livestock. Pants can be grown in multy story greenhouses as tall as skyscrapers. My fourth argument is that a properly managed vegan diet is more healthy than a meat diet. It would make people more healthy and thus happier a d less of a burden on society. My response to your argument: You ask me to prove why we have obligation to be vegan. Well may I ask you if you think we had an obligation to free the slaves? you will find your answer entertaining this notion. If you dont think we where obliged to free slaves, then we cannot rely on your definition of this word to bring us any enlightenment. However if you do think we where obliged to free them, then that same obligation is the one we bare to animals. But if you want my understanding: We don't have an obligation. But only because obligation is abstract. It would be more virtuos,kind,compassionate and 'good' to move toward a world that doesn't use animals as commodities. I think you would agree yes? So the real question is: do you have 'being good' as an obligation or not. If you don't oblige yourself to do the right thing then you have no obligation to be vegan. If you habitually oblige yourself to do the right thing, then you are obliged to be vegan. Okay for your second point, your using a man made idea of what humans rights should be, to legitimatise animal cruelty. The morality of the world does not come the human rights treaty. You say people should have the right to choose. They do have the right too choose. Organised animal cruelty will just be illegal. Don't you see the hypocrisy though my friend? I mean, I feel stupid and condescending saying it but: what about the animals choices? Do they not matter? Also, people don't have rights to make others suffer. You are using the idea of rights to deny rights! Can you not see the hypocrisy? Your food luxury argument is flawed. If nobody ate meat, they would be no meat products available. And no, in that typical scenario that happens to us all (being stranded in the wilderness), eating an animal to survive is survival and you have hunted its fairly, presumably. Food reduction argument-totally wrong, look at my points. People will loose their jobs. Open your mind. Murder and rape create jobs, so does suffering and death, loosing and creating jobs means nothing, also the society would evolve. We don't still fret over having no town crier.

vegan,"Con thesis: The pro thesis is absolutist and not every adult living in a first world country should be Vegan. There are five main points to my argument. Economy, Health/Survival, Developing Countries CON CASE- Economy- Claim: The meat industry is extremely valuable to the world's economy Warrant: (Using the United States as an example) ""In 2013, more than 482,100 workers were directly employed in the meat and poultry packing and processing industries, according to data from the North American Meat Institute (NAMI). Their combined salaries total more than $19 billion, it said. With suppliers and distributors included, that number climbs to 6.2 million jobs and generates $864.2 billion annually, or roughly 6 percent of the entire U.S. GDP, it said."" (1) Impact: Following the warrant, eliminating the meat industry is not economically viable and would result in severe economic consequences. Health/Survival- Claim: Humanity in present day could not survive a worldwide vegetarian/vegan diet Warrant: Our resources are not sustainable enough and would not be even without the meat industry's negative environmental effects. the notion that an ideal form of food production operating with a minimal environmental impact should exclude meat "" nothing less than enacting ""vegetarian imperative"" (Saxena 2011) on a global scale "" does not make sense. ""This is because both grasslands and croplands produce plenty of phytomass that is not digestible by humans and that would be, if not regularly harvested, simply wasted and left to decay. In addition, processing of crops to produce milled grains, plant oils and other widely consumed foodstuffs generates a large volume of by-products that make (as described in Chapter 4) perfect animal feeds. Rice milling strips typically 30% of the grain""s outermost layers, wheat milling takes away about 15%: what would we do with about 300 Mt of these grain milling residues, with roughly the same mass of protein-rich oil cakes left after extraction of oil (in most species accounts for only 20""25% of oilseed phytomass), and also with the by-products of ethanol (distillers grain) and dairy industries (whey), waste from fruit and vegetable canning (leaves, peels), and citrus rinds and pulp?"" (2) Impact: An unsustainable food/vegan farming system to replace the old one. No change in sustainability. Developing Countries- Claim: Developing Countries rates of meat consumption are rapidly rising Warrant: ""Developing countries have very diverse food consumption patterns and agricultural production systems. The proportion of meat in national diets varies from negligible in some countries in central Africa to 30-40% in some countries in Latin America and Mongolia. However, the demand for meat in developing countries is increasing rapidly (53%/year from 1982 to 1993), as the result of population growth and the trend for people to move to the cities. Growth rates in consumption are greatest in Asia, with China dominating the statistics, in view of the size of its population. Theoretically, livestock production can be increased to meet this demand, but the multiple roles of livestock in developing countries must be recognized if this is to be achieved in a sustainable manner. Resource-poor farmers who keep livestock may value more highly their contribution to livelihoods and to crop production, through provision of draught power and improvements in soil fertility through the recycling of manure, than the production of more meat. Recognition of the goals of the farmer and the wishes of the consumer regarding meat quality need to be reflected in the way in which opportunities for increasing meat production are identified and communicated to farmers. The impact of the global economy on cereal prices, for example, will also influence which interventions will be economically viable. Interpretation of information in an integral manner, using geographical information systems, mathematical models and/or simple spreadsheet models will be an important ingredient in turning scientific knowledge into increased meat production in developing countries."" (3) Impact: there are multiple warrants within this argument and therefore multiple impacts. The first is that developing countries have seen a major rise in meat production and will therefore offset benefits to eliminating meat industries in the united states. The second is that farmers in developing countries continue to produce more without regards to the environment and health, leaving countries that have eliminated the meat industry unable to help them for moral and political reasons. On the flip side, if they did help developing countries eliminate their meat industries, the global economy would be tanked (no warrant, see first claim). The third warrant is that the meat industries in these countries will continue to grow despite drawbacks, meaning developing countries then have a moral obligation to assist them in order to preserve their populations and the environment, which turns the pro impacts. REBUTTALS- Ethics- Rights are unique to human beings rights only have meaning within a moral community only human beings live in a moral community adult mammals don't understand or practice living according to a moral code the differences in the way human beings and adult mammals experience the world are morally relevant therefore rights is a uniquely human concept and only applies to human beings (4) AND No impact to ethics, it's mere philosophical speculation Arbitrary Lines- concede this claim, it has no link to the argument, neither King nor Dawkins practiced veganism and are not credible sources. The evidence was shifted to try to favor pro's argument and should therefore be dropped in the debate. Humane Washing- http://www.qmscotland.co.uk... This link gives multiple reasons as to why meat is good for humans, meaning that there is a reason behind killing animals (to eat) and is therefore not an ""unnecessary harm"" AND I question the logic of this argument on my opponent's part. If animals are not being treated inhumanely, the harms of factory farming go away and thus so do environmental impacts, and all this is because OF cage-free and similar methods, why get rid of them? Couldn't that model be used to then help developing countries to become more sustainable, and wouldn't that be better overall? This particular argument is meant as a challenge of logic rather than a direct rebuttal Environment- Counter Claim- Grazing is necessary to a sustainable ecosystem (5) AND cattle do not contribute greatly to greenhouse gases (5) AND optimal farming includes animals. This outweighs the impacts of the pro argument (5) (The quotes from source (5) are quite lengthy so i did not insert them verbatim) Health- Counter-Claim: Studies for the health setbacks of meat are inconclusive and contradicted by credible sources. In one cohort study, scientists studied 11,000 people, 57 percent of whom were omnivores (meat eaters) and the other 43 percent were vegetarians. Both groups were health conscious. Yet in this study, researchers found the overall death rates were cut in half for both health-conscious meat eaters and for vegetarians, as compared to the average person eating a western-style, processed food diet. The study concluded that for the vegetarians, there was no benefit found; and for the meat eaters, there was no increased risk for heart disease, cancer or death. (6) (1)http://www.nbcnews.com...

vegan,"I also thank him or her for getting the formalities out of the way and doing such a thorough job. Definitions are fine, burden of proof is accepted. So let's begin. As stated in the resolution, I am affirming that anyone who has the ability to adopt a vegan diet should do so. Obviously, this means that I do not think less-developed countries struggling with disease and poverty should focus on adopting a vegan diet, even though most LDCs consume very few meat products. In this case, I'm talking about developed nations, because those are the nations that do have the ability to do so. As I stated initially, I advocate veganism for ethical, environmental, and health reasons. Con voiced an objection to taking a moral stance on this issue, but I maintain my ethical opposition to non-vegan diets. I do not believe in objective morality, and I agree with con in that this should not turn into a debate about morality. But I also did leave this debate fairly open-ended on purpose, because I think the moral stance on veganism should also be argued here. Therefore, I will still make the case for the moral consequences of veganism, and con may address it in any way he sees fit. Ethical: My primary concern with this issue is one of ethics. The obvious objection here is the treatment of animals in factory farms. In these farms, which have been established in almost every developed nation, animals are systematically raped, tortured, mutilated, and violently and painfully executed for the sole purpose of satisfying our selfish desires. (After all, most people concede that the treatment of animals in these farms is awful, but they want to continue to enjoy cheeseburgers, bacon, etc.) Animals are packed into tight, crowded warehouses without sunlight or fresh air. The conditions are so bad that they often attack and kill each other. Many animals develop painful sores or contract diseases, none of which are treated. Cows are typically de-horned and de-tailed without anesthetics, and chicken are likewise de-beaked. Female cows are repeatedly raped until they are no longer fertile, at which point they are killed for fast-food meat. These atrocities are commonplace in factory farms. Why do we allow this to happen? Again, many people take the simple stance of enjoyment; it's their life, they like meat, why shouldn't they be able to enjoy it? Well, when the enjoyment of one infringes upon the enjoyment of others, it becomes a problem. This is, of course, why we condemn rape and other similar actions. One cannot use the argument that he enjoys sex and should therefore be allowed to have it when it infringes upon another's right to choose who and when she has sex with. The rebuttal here may be that animals do not have the cognitive faculties to ""choose"" things like that, or to ""object"" the way we do. Perhaps, but it is an empirically proven fact that animals (especially mammalian animals like cows and pigs) feel pain in essentially the same capacity as humans; additionally, cows and pigs have been shown to feel fear, anxiety, and other emotions that many people assume animals are not capable of. Why, then, is it seen as acceptable to torture and kill them? Why do animal abuse laws exist to protect our pets but not to protect cows from having their throats ripped out? All this being said, I am realistic. I understand that humans used to need to hunt and kill animals for survival (even though our ancestors were primarily fruit and vegetable eaters). I do not take issue with that, because we were doing what we had to do to sustain ourselves and our species. But the fact is that such actions are no longer necessary. This question might come off as loaded, but I will pose it anyway: if you would not be okay with someone torturing and violently killing your dog or cat, why are you okay with it being done to other animals? I'm not saying animals should have the same rights as human beings, but I do think that, as sentient beings who can feel pain and experience suffering, they should at least have the right not to be tortured, raped, and killed for prophet and enjoyment. In the U.S. alone, 90,000 cows and calves are slaughtered every day; 14,000 chickens are slaughtered every minute; and over 10 billion 'food animals' are slaughtered every year. This is not necessary. It is death on a genocidal level. Environmental: Adopting a vegan diet has a direct, positive impact on the environment. Factory farming is an environmental nightmare. In addition to the carbon footprint left from the shipping of animals and supplies across the country, it takes 2,500 gallons of water to produce one pound of meat. (Compare this to the 25 gallons needed to produce a pound of wheat.) Here are a few other environmental statistics, all taken from organicconsumers.org (I typically don't just copy and paste, but it would be pointless to try to paraphrase all of this): (1) The USDA reports that animals in the US meat industry produce 61 million tons of waste each year, which is 130 times the volume of human waste - or five tons for every US citizen. (2) North Carolina's 7,000,000 factory-raised hogs create four times as much waste - stored in reeking, open cesspools - as the state's 6.5 million people. The Delmarva Peninsula's 600 million chickens produce 400,000 tons of manure a year. (3) According to the Environmental Protection Agency, hog, chicken and cattle waste has polluted 35,000 miles of rivers in 22 states and contaminated groundwater in 17 states. (4) Pfiesteria, a microscopic organism that feeds off the phosphorus and nitrogen found in manure, is a lethal toxin harmful to both humans and fish. In 1991 alone, 1,000,000,000,000 (one billion) fish were killed by pfiesteria in the Neuse River in North Carolina. (5) Since 1995, an additional one billion fish have been killed from manure runoff in estuaries and coastal areas in North Carolina, and the Maryland and Virginia tributaries leading into the Chesapeake Bay. These deaths can be directly related to the 10 million hogs currently being raised in North Carolina and the 620 million chickens on the Eastern Shore of the Chesapeake Bay. (6) The pollution from animal waste causes respiratory problems, skin infections, nausea, depression and even death for people who live near factory farms. Livestock waste has been linked to six miscarriages in women living near a hog factory in Indiana. (7) In Virginia, state guidelines indicate that a safe level of fecal coliform bacteria is 200 colonies per 100 milliliters of water. In 1997, some streams had levels as high as 424,000 per 100 milliliters. And keep in mind that most of those statistics were confined to only one state in one country. You can imagine the world-wide effect this is having. Health: Adopting a vegan diet is healthy. All meat (beef, pork, poultry, and seafood) has been linked to cancer, high blood pressure, heart problems, strokes, and other health issues. Milk (and all its derivatives) has been linked to breast cancer in women and stomach and prostrate cancer in men. And this is only ""healthy"" meat; it is to say nothing of all the thousands of diseases that are reported annually from tainted meat. It is also to say nothing of the twenty-million pounds of antibiotics that are given to animals that are created antibiotic-resistant infections in humans as a result. In addition to antibiotics, many animals are fed Prozac and other prescription drugs, as well as hormones to sustain growth, none of which are healthy for human consumption. I'd like to say more on this issue, but I'm running out of space. I'll end with one last statistics: 5000 deaths and 76 million cases of food-borne illness occur annually.

nuclear energy,"I'm in favour for nuclear energy. For economical reasons, nuclear energy has strong benefits. Like my opponent said, nuclear power plants are expensive to build and we need to use energy for building it. But the main mistake that we make is we are looking too close to this subject. Nuclear power plant is an energy source which can give us highly more energy then others. If we compare a nuclear power plant with thermal power plant, we can clearly see that nuclear energy will gain us what we lost while we're building the centrals. And the ending of the fossil fuels are really close(1). We're dependent on thermal power and fuels so nuclear energy will be a useful hand of help. For environmental reasons, nuclear energy has many radioactive wastes. But I think that we can agree on something: The worlds most important problem is Global Worming. It will destroy us slowly. And that's why we're our children to be careful and be aware of the effects of global warming. Now whit this fabulous energy type, we have a chance to and the global warming. For the effects of nuclear power plants, I need you to know that 95% of the energy generated by nuclear burn up is without any waste of CO2. So we should use nuclear energy to stop our biggest problem in the world. For the risks, Nuclear radiation is risky but the radiation will leave the central only if there is a crack in the central. We had seen it in Chernobyl, but now, we have a better technology and better scientist. We need to trust on our people to make this energy useful. Secondly., radiation is an important factor but we can't prove that the cancer is caused by the nuclear radiation. Of course it will effect the human health but ,we, people experience a lot of technological devices in our daily lives, like phones or televisions. Are we going to get rid of them just because of radiation? And the cancers are highly caused because of portable telephones, especially(2). Radars, satellite stations and microwave ovens operate also high radio frequencies. 1:http://www.forbes.com... 2:http://www.cancer.gov...",PRO,We're dependent on thermal power and fuels so nuclear energy will be a useful hand of help. ... 1:http://www.forbes.com... 2:http://www.cancer.gov...,511
nuclear energy,"Resolved: The United States federal government should increase investment in nuclear power sources. I am representing the affirmative position of the resolution. I will be claming that the USFG does need to increase investment in nuclear energy. Definitions: 1) Investment--a contribution of something such as time, energy, or effort to an activity, project, or undertaking, in the expectation of a benefit (source: MicrosoftWorks dictionary) 2) Nuclear power--the use of sustained nuclear fission to generate heat and do useful work, most of the time with the goal of producing commercially servicable electricity. Contentions: 1) Nuclear energy is a more environmentally friendly alternative to other, more conventional means of producing electricity. 2) Increased investment into nuclear energy would alleviate the United States' dependence on imported, environmentally unfriendly, petroleum-based energy sources. 3) Nuclear energy is a scientifically proven, known energy source that is ""ready for market"". Explanation of Contentions: 1) Nuclear energy is a more environmentally friendly alternative to other, more conventional means of producing electricity. Nuclear energy is among one of the world's cleanest energy sources. It produces very low levels of CO2 emissions and, during its lifetime, is comparable to so called ""green"" energy sources such as wind, solar, and hydro emissions [1]. The most up-to-date study, conducted at the Forsmark nuclear power facility in Sweden during 2005, shows that the plant was producing only 3.10 grams of CO2 per kilowatt per hour [1]. In contrast, information gathered from the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection Agency shows that the average coal power plant in the United States during the year 2000 produced 2.095 pounds of CO2 per kilowatt per hour [2]. A simple mathematical calculation revels that nuclear power, on average, produces almost 97.8 percent less carbon dioxide emissions than coal power. Thus, nuclear power would be beneficial because it would lower carbon emissions consequently increasing air quality and curtailing this nation's contribution to global climate change. 2) Increased investment into nuclear energy would alleviate the United States' dependence on imported, environmentally unfriendly, petroleum-based energy sources. Currently, oil is the lifeblood of the American economy. Oil supplies 40 percent of the United States' total energy demands [3]. Today, nearly 60 percent of the oil utilized and consumed in the United States is imported from foreign countries [4]. Using middle school math, we can concur that 24 percent (nearly one-fourth) of our energy is supplied by oil drilled, refined, or otherwise produced in foreign countries. Noting the current geopolitical situation and the worldwide increase in oil demand, relying on foreign oil does not seem like a viable long-term economic strategy for the United States. Thus, the United States should be investing in other sources that can supply our nation with the energy its needs for continued global economic dominance. Nuclear power is the energy source that is best positioned to take that role as it has become one of the leading energy sources in the world. For example, nearly 75% of all energy consumed in France is produced by nuclear sources [5]. Not only has nuclear energy provided the French people with energy security, it has lead France to become a net energy exporter as it gains over 3 billion Euros (4,312,800,000 USD) from exporting nuclear power and nuclear power technology [5]. As it is clear to see in the precedent set by the French government, nuclear energy is a sustainable long-term energy source that can lessen a nation's dependence on unreliable, foreign-energy sources. 3) Nuclear energy is a scientifically proven, known energy source that is ""ready for market"". Unlike wind and solar energy, nuclear energy is a proven energy source that has been in use since 1942 [6]. Thus, the wide-scale adoption of nuclear energy in the United States would require very little additional research and development as most of the technologies to be used have already been formulated. Furthermore, the more widespread adoption of nuclear power in the United States would require no changes be made to the national power grid as it was constructed with nuclear energy in mind. In contrast, there are some questions about the practicality of wind, solar, and geothermal energy sources. I thank whoever shall accept this debate challenge in advance. Happy debating!

nuclear energy,"In my opinion Nuclear Energy is necessary for countries. Before we discuss on energy or environmental effects, we need to make sure that nuclear energy is possible to use for all the countries. Of course, that will happen with money. When we look closer, nuclear energy makes a lot of difference in our world of economy. But if we look generally, it will gain us what we lost. Because the energy which is made by thermal power plant is a lot lesser than the nuclear energy. So we can say that the centrals of nuclear power is cost a lot but the energy we gain with that will equal the difference. Now for the environmental effects. Nuclear Energy isn't polluting the world as thermal power plants. Thermal energy causes the global warming which is the most important world discussion and the most dangerous natural disaster of our generation. There is not any carbon dioxide pollution with nuclear energy. So this energy do not emit harmful gases. Nuclear energy is an emission-free energy source because it does not burn anything to produce electricity. It does not cause any ground-level ozone formation, smog, and acid rain like thermal power plants.(1) I think that if we can use an energy type which harms our environment a lot and which does not produce enough energy as nuclear power, why can't we use nuclear power? Nuclear energy has a lot of risks, it is true and everybody knows it but in my opinion, mankind did a lot of dangerous things. We can't improve ourselves without taking risks. We are going to learn our mistakes for the future generations. We can look at Chernobyl disaster. The disaster really caused a lot of radioactive waste. But noting will work perfectly with the first try. The main risk of the nuclear power is the nuclear weapons. So if we stop using them, there is not any fatal risks. You can ask that ""if the reactor explodes.."", but the technology we use in past and in present, there is a huge difference between them. We can know and control what our abilities to do with nuclear powers. If we compare the energy made by thermal and nuclear, we will understand the difference. Of course there is renewable energy plants like solar or hydro but these are not making enough energy as nuclear power. A typical reactor of uranium convert 500.000mj/kg but for oil the number is just 45-46mj/kg(2). Also,we have to use 2 million grams of oil or 3 million grams of coal to equal the power contained in 1 gram of uranium fuel(3). To sum up, Nuclear energy is necessary for all the countries and it is likely more useful then other types of power plants.

nuclear energy,"Sorry for the argument delay. My final argument is more about risks. Before talking about the risks, we can say that Nuclear power plants cost a lot for building them but it will recover energy and regain the money we lost. Nuclear power plants produce highly more energy then other energy plants. For the risks, I want to quote from the subject which is ""Nuclear Energy for COUNTRIES"". In Europe there are 185 nuclear centrals (Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Russian Federation, UK...)(1) And I would like to remind you that every thermal or nuclear power plant can explode or pollute the world. So If we are arguing about countries, and we are, we need to look to the subject from another point of view. Imagine that you are a president of a country which exists in Europe and which doesn't have any nuclear power plant. But the country still has risks because of the other countries nuclear centrals. So that country has the risks of nuclear damage but not from their nuclear centrals, from different countries nuclear centrals. So that country can build their own centrals and use them. We can't demand other countries to close their centrals because, like France, Nuclear energy is their biggest energy sources (France: 58nuclear reactors, 63,130 MWe)(2) Moreover; Nuclear energy is a prove that science is still advancing. If we say no to this wonderful gift of science, we will stop the evolution of science. Don't stop the Nuclear Energy for future generations...

nuclear energy,"I will begin with my opponent's case and then present an alternative to nuclear energy. Opening statement: My opponent has produced some very impressive data on the efficiency of nuclear energy. Prima facie or first glance could easily sway a person to support nuclear energy. I vaguely recall having done rudimentary research on nuclear energy for a Lincoln-Douglas topic last fall. In fact, a conversation I had with our science department head revealed only one significant pitfall, what to do with the waste? My opponent has even identified dis-ads of nuclear waste and offered suggestions on the very subject of nuclear waste. If we dig deeper though, what are other concerns? Let's explore! 1) Effectiveness. At first glance the only disagreements I could identify were really nitpicky stuff. I could say that some of the water which became steam would inevitably evaporate and have to be replaced. I could even strengthen my opponent's defense by saying that the moving parts replacement schedule is likely very minimal. There is no shame in expanding Robert Fulton's use of steam even if it is an old idea. We still use wheels right? :o) There is no doubt that nuclear energy can offer power to communities. I, and the judges, are likely tired of semantical battles of topicality, that being said; much of my opponent's first point are stipulated and conceded. 2) Safety. This is a cause for concern. While technologically developed nations such as the U.S.A., the U.K., and France have operated plants for upwards of 60 years without serious incident, that does not make them immune to trouble. Many safeguards have been implemented since the 1950's to improve and upgrade the facilities. Yet, even superpowers such as the U.S. (3 mile island) and the former Soviet Union (Chernobyl) have had their share of growing pains. Most recently, another developed nation, Japan, experienced a calamity of catastrophic proportion. Are nuclear power plants compeletly safe? No. Now consider lesser developed nations that are seeking nuclear power, Iran and North Korea for example. Both are suspect for being politically unstable as well as using nuclear energy to develop nuclear weapons. Oversight can be a tricky thing when a more radical nation prefers not to be inspected or have other's watching over their shoulders as they attempt to develop energy, or secretly weaponry. This forces them to be sneaky, which may lead to shortcuts, which may lead to disaster. Security of nuclear facilities. There are high protocol, likely classified, to protect the integrity of nuclear facilities in developed nations. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for less stable nations. Can anyone, with any certainty, verify the count of every spent rod or piece of weaponry from the the Former Soviet Union, especially after the breakup of the former into 15 separate and independent nations? I would have to say no. Further, what would prevent well organized and well funded terrorists from acquiring nuclear materials in lesser developed nations? This too eats away at the safety argument. An article I discovered addresses nuclear waste in a different light than that of my opponent. Like my opponent, it identfied waste that was short term and had reduced effects with proper handling and recycling. Also, like my opponent it identified longer term waste. However; the safety of the longer term waste was the compelling factor. It is quite dangerous, ecologically unfriendly, and can take an estimated 1000 years to decay. http://www.scienceclarified.com... These are a few ""what if"" or otherwise hypothetical scenarios that challenge nuclear energy safety as well as historical examples such as 3 mile island, Chernobyl, and Japan. While precautions and protocol do exist, they are far from foolproof, and are not necessarily as safe as my opponent would have us believe. http://www.nirs.org... 3) Costs. My opponent has demonstrated that nuclear energy does indeed exceed the effectiveness of fossil fuels. It's common knowledge and widely accepted that once established, nuclear is more logical than fossil. It appears to be cleaner in emissions, and uses fewer resources in producing more energy. At first glance, this seems to make perfect sense. This leads me to ask a question. Why then isn't everyone using nuclear energy then? A Smithsonian study showed that only approximately 16% of the worl'd energy is nuclear based. Since it is demonstrably more effective as shown by my opponent's CBA, why aren't most nations using it? Simply put, the necessary precautions make it cost prohibitive. Many African and Central American nations struggle to even provide basic necessities to their citizens. Citizens in African nations do not enjoy clean water, adequate food, clothing, or shelter. Haiti and Honduras don't even have a pot to piss in. In fact, many nations have substandard living conditions to include plumbing and basic sanitation. Constructing a nuclear power plant is not in their foreseeable future. My case: At first glance my alternative seems to be a reinvention of the wheel. There are alternatives to nuclear energy though. All of which can be done at a fraction of the cost of nuclear energy, and boast a much better safety record. HYDRO: Every nation does have rivers. Dams can be constructed, and power can be retrieved via hydro energy. SOLAR: Especially with so many ""experts"" verifying the existence of greenhouse gases and global warming, you would think that would open the door even wider for good ol' solar power. Yes the sun shines all over the earth! Yes, solar panels are expensive, and yes, at present they need to be rather large to capture this energy. Why can't every roof be a solar panel? This is worth research and development money! Opportunity is knocking! (For my beloved Israelis, I am offering triple mitzvah points if you discover it first) Who among us on this earth will be the first to develop more efficient solar power for all to enjoy? WIND: The wind blows. Meterologists have ways to track weather and determine the most strategic locations to place wind energy generators. KINETIC GENERATORS: Quite possibly the world's best kept secret! These puppies are built at a nominal cost, and run virtually clean, quiet, and very efficient. This is probably the better answer to the energy crisis. We (Collectively) have put boo-koodles of investment money into so many things. It makes sense to look into research for the large scale, big picture. http://www.homestandbygeneratorsystems.com... In closing: While nuclear energy is a better alternative than fossil fuels, it has yet to replace them. Why? It is both dangerous, and cost prohibitive. I am suggesting that nuclear energy research monies be diverted toward large scale research of kinetic generators.

nuclear energy,"I would like to thank diddleysquat for accepting this debate. My first argument is going to be rather short, simply making a case for nuclear energy. I will be more in depth when I respond to con's objections and refutations. Amount Nuclear energy represents the longest-lasting, uninterrupted source of power the world has. Fossil fuels are fast running out and renewables need backup generators to run when energy is not being created. ""According to the NEA, identified uranium resources total 5.5 million metric tons, and an additional 10.5 million metric tons remain undiscovered - a roughly 230-year supply at today's consumption rate in total. Further exploration and improvements in extraction technology are likely to at least double this estimate over time."" Of current known reserves, that's 230 years.[1] On top of that, other sources of uranium (such as seawater) and more efficiently built power points could dramatically raise that already large number. ""...fuel-recycling fast-breeder reactors, which generate more fuel than they consume, would use less than 1 percent of the uranium needed for current LWRs."" This means that these plants would run out of the current supply of uranium in 30000 years.[1] Even further, uranium is only one potential ore. Take thorium, for example. The Thorium Energy Alliance says, ""There is enough thorium in the United States alone to power the country at its current energy level for over 10,000 years."" Further, protactinium, radium, polonium, lead, bismuth, and radon could all be used as well.[2][3] What this adds up to is a tremendous supply of energy not just for today, but for the unknown demands of tomorrow. Between the different ores (many have multiple isotopes), it may be so that, at current energy consumption, we could sustain ourselves for 1 million years on nuclear fission reactions alone. Nuclear energy clearly has much greater reserves than fossil fuels, and energy that is always available, unlike renewables. Efficiency Not only is the amount of nuclear energy enormous, the way it is used is more efficient than other forms of energy. For example, take power plant capacity factors. This considers actual energy production as a percentage of potential energy production at full capacity- ""Nuclear energy facilities generate electricity 24/7 at an 86 percent capacity factor. This is more efficient than other types of energy - combined-cycle natural gas, with a 56 percent capacity factor; coal-fired at 55 percent; and wind at 31 percent."" In other words, nuclear power plants produce energy more of the time than other forms of energy.[4] Further, let's now consider cost. Nuclear energy, per unit of energy, is the cheapest energy option that the world has. """"Production costs at nuclear energy facilities in 2012 averaged 2.40 cents per kilowatt-hour, cheaper than coal (3.27 cents) and natural gas-fueled plants (3.40 cents)."" It also costs much less the renewable energy sources.[4] Here is a picture of the range and median costs of four types of energy: [5] Nuclear energy is cheaper and more efficient that other forms of energy, as it has a greater capacity factor and lower per unit energy costs than than other forms of energy, both fossil fuels and renewable. Environment I'm sure my opponent will talk about this, and I'll have much more to say in the appropriate rounds, but I can make a positive argument here. Nuclear energy actually has very little effect on the environment. ""Of all energy sources, nuclear energy has perhaps the lowest impact on the environment especially in relation to kilowatts produced because nuclear plants do not emit harmful gases, require a relatively small area, and effectively minimize or negate other impacts. In other words, nuclear energy is the most ""ecologically efficient"" of all energy sources because it produces the most electricity in relation to its minimal environmental impact. There are no significant adverse effects to water, land, habitat, species, and air resources.""[6] Further, the amount of waste that is produced is greatly reduced compared to fossil fuels. ""Because uranium contains many thousands of times more energy per unit of weight than fossil fuels, the waste from a nuclear power station is very small in volume and is fully managed and extremely secure at the nuclear sites."" The small amount of waste can be stored safely in secure locations, and without harmful effect, unlike with fossil fuels.[7] Conclusion Overall, when considering the amount of nuclear energy the Earth has (potentially over 1 million years worth at current capacity), the capacity factor it has from producing energy more of the time (unlike often interrupted renewables), the lower cost of nuclear energy per unit of energy, and the lessened strains on the environment, it is clear that nuclear energy is a good choice for society.

nuclear energy,"Nuclear energy; an inherently unsustainable power or the perfect form of energy? The question in itself and it's nature is subjective, but nuclear energy definitely comes with a plethora of benefits. Firstly, I would like to define several terms: ENERGY: power derived from the utilization of physical or chemical resources, esp. to provide light and heat or to work machines. Nuclear energy has had a long and troublesome history; from Chernobyl, where the careless Reds proved that even 100 of them are unable to screw up a light bulb, to the most recent Fukushima-Daiichi, where a natural disaster (and to some degree, carelessness) caused a huge nuclear meltdown. The concept of nuclear energy was first theorized by Enrico Fermi in 1932; in 1938, German Scientists were already investigating the concept; these German physicists determined that by splitting the nucular atom into pieces, it would divide the nucular atom into two roughly equal pieces. However, the result of this experiment was surprising; the nucular atoms were divided into larger pieces; this process was called fission. After the results of these experiments were made open to the public, many supported government research into nuclear fission. After the two bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the public determined that uranium should be used for peace, and not war. The first nuclear reactor was introduced in 1954 by the Soviet Union. Called the Obrinsk Nuclear Power Plant, this reactor produced 5 megawatts of energy; however, as nuclear technology developed, nuclear plants became larger and more efficient. By the 1980s, they were able to produce 300mh per year. Today, there are 435 operable nuclear powerplants, and 71 nuclear power plants that are still under construction. And why are the governments of the world pursuing nuclear power as an alternative to conventional ways of producing energy? 1. It is more efficient Nuclear Powerplants are costly to build, but there are some major benefits to it. US Nuclear powerplants can create upto 11.8 billion kW/h (769 billion kW per year), when compared to that of US oil-powered powerplant, which produces 3 billion kW/h. In France, 407tw/H of electricity was produced in 2004, and French Nuclear Powerplants have the ability of producing 60,000 mW. France has around 60 Nuclear Power Plants; this puts each powerplant of being able to produce 1,000mw of electricity per year! Compare this to the highly expensive solar panels, which are able to produce only 55mW per year. Ironically, nuclear energy also cost less than solar power; in France, where 75% of the energy produce comes from nuclear energy, a kW of energy costs only $0.23 per household; compare this to New England's $18.75 per household, where only 10% of the energy comes from Nuclear power (nation wide) 2. It is more eco-friendly Apart from being more efficient, it is also more sustainable and eco-friendly. Nuclear energy releases 20grms. of Carbon Dioxide (the greenhouse gas that is commonly known to cause global warming) per tW/H; compare this to the 500grms. of Carbon Dioxide released when using oil sources. (In fact, the Co2 released by nuclear plants are indirect) This is because the process of fission creates the heat, as apart from burning something to create the neccesary steam to turn the power generator. In France, nuclear power has contributed highly to the low Co2 emissions from power sources; France has low (when compared to the US and China) CO2 emissions per capita. 3. It is safer Ironically, nuclear energy is (when compared with coal and other materials) much more safer than many other sources of energy. Nuclear energy produces 5.9% of the world's energy, but it experiences only 0.04 deaths per tW produced. Compare this with the 100 from Coal created energy, which produces 26% of the world's energy and 36 of oil, which produces 36% of the world's energy. We can therefore clearly see that nuclear power is safe for the environment, the people, and is much more efficient than many other energy sources. But the question then arises; why oppose nuclear power? The opponent will provide an answer to that question. I wish Con the best of luck with her next case.

nuclear energy,"thank you for this debate my good man. definitions: Nuclear power source: nuclear power plant, C1 - Location - One cannot account nor predetermine what kind of weather patterns will change due to global warming. Location is the biggest issue with a nuclear power plant. You can't place it anywhere where there is a high risk place like natural disasters (earthquakes, hurricanes, etc.). The power plant cannot be placed in any urban area due one simply needs to see japan to now why or Chernobyl but even then a spill can contaminate for miles in any direction. Furthermore We are still fighting a ""war on terror"" this makes nuclear power plant high risk. So the power plant cannot be built anywhere in the coasts or near faults or in high density areas that leaves the rural areas however it cannot be placed there either because if there is a spill the people there loose their source of income and maybe thier lives due to human error. C2 -cost- nuclear power plant construction costs—mainly materials, labor, and engineering—rose by 185 percent between 2000 and 2007. More recently, costs have been increasing even faster: In mid-March, Progress Energy informed state regulators that the twin 1,100 MW nuclear plants it intends to build in Florida would cost $14 billion, which ""triples estimates the utility offered little more than a year ago."" Jim Harding, former director of power planning and forecasting for Seattle City Light, estimates that nuclear plants constructed today would provide electricity at between 12 and 17 cents per kilowatt-hour. To put this cost into perspective, the average U.S. electricity price in 2006 was 8.9 cents per kWh, and well-placed wind turbines can produce electricity for less than 5 cents per kWh. So nuclear power actally costs more than wind or water power. C3 - investment - Subsidies for nuclear reactors wouldn't subsidize nuclear technology—they would subsidize the nuclear industry. Congress should fund research of clean, alternative energy technologies that promise to rival fossil fuels in cost—without subsidies. Congress should also provide tax credits that would make such technologies cheaper by encouraging production and moving them down the experience curve. Such support would encourage a growing American industry and create American jobs. By squandering our limited resources on subsidies for the nuclear power industry, the United States is missing an extraordinary opportunity. C4 - Waste - Where is all the waste going to go? nuclear power generates toxic waste never mind that america hasn't really built one in over thirty years and never mind that japan steel is the only company which produces the central part of a nuclear reactor containment vessel. All the waste generated by uranium/plutonium ( and we don't have vry much uranium so availability is also a problem) will go in big containers and be buried in the earth which is sort of ironic because nuclear energy is supposedly clean. Conclusion: The united states federal gov't should not invest in nuclear power sources because of lack of understanding nuclear power plants, there is no viable location of where to put nuclear reactors, They would be high risk targets for terrorists, an investment in them would not be wise, and there would be a generation of waste and the availability of uranium is another problem as well.

nuclear energy,"I would like to thank my opponent for accepting this debate and look forward to a wonder debate on the merits of Nuclear Energy. I will be presenting my arguments then address the points brought up by my opponent. My argument is going to break down into three separate categories. Effectiveness, Safety, and Cost. == My Arguments == 1)Effectiveness of Nuclear Energy Nuclear reactors generate electricity though good ol' fashion steam driven generators (the two most common reactors are the PWR [1] and the BWR [2]). The only thing that the nuclear material is used for is heating up the water and turning it into steam. This may sound like old technology, but with modern technology, it is quite capable of generating immense amounts of usable energy with very little input. Since the water that is turned to steam can be cooled and condensed, the water can be reused, and so never needs to be replaced. This means that the only thing that needs to be replaced is the nuclear fuel and parts through general wear and tear (usually the generator, since it has the most moving parts). The nuclear fuel can last about 2 years before needing to be replaced in modern power plants [3]. However, new designs, such as the TWR [4] are designed so that they can go decades between refueling and can even use fuel that was once viewed as waste (only using a small amount of U235, and a vast majority of U238). Your average nuclear reactor produces around 1,000 MW of power, and many power plants will have several reactors on site. The average American home uses 940 kWh per month [5]. This means that a single nuclear reactor (at 1,000 MW) can provide power for about 766,000 homes (exact number is 765,957.5). 2)Safety of nuclear energy and its waste Everyone knows that nuclear material can be dangerous to your health if you are directly exposed to it. This is why nuclear power plants go to crazy lengths to protect people for as much risk as they can. In PWRs, along with many computerized safety systems, the nuclear material is removed from the environment by two layers of the functioning reactor. While in the BWR, the water that the reactor is in is only removed by one layer. Emerging styles, like the PBMR [6] that use silicon carbide for friction protection, are essentially meltdown proof, as should the reactor lose power, the natural flow of the gases in the reactor would prevent a meltdown. When it comes to the waste, reprocessing can eliminate around 80% of it, though it isn't a flat 80% that is being removed. It is basically digging through the waste and gathering the remaining U238 and the Pu239 that forms and is not fissiled away. Originally, we only reprocessed to gather the Pu239 in order to make bombs, but that Pu239 can be used as fuel. What aren't reused in the waste are all the Cs, Rb, I, and other fissile products. While those are still dangerous and need to be handled with care, the biggest bad boy in the waste is actually the Pu239 (partially because it will turn to the super evil Radon gas). The rest is bad, but not nearly close to Pu. This means that by reprocessing it, it actually makes less waste, and more importantly makes it safer for the whole family (not recommended for children under 10, the elderly, pregnant women, or human skin in general). We also have a wonderful option in new technologies that are developing such as nuclear decay reactors (NDR) [8], which allow us to take radioactive waste, place it in a modified reactor and simply turn the heat that comes off of it into electricity. The other option is to take the waste away and bury it. Now, if the waste is reprocessed, all the Pu239, U238, and any U235 still in it, are removed. So all we have left is the fissile product. The most common of which is Cs133, I135, Zr93 and Mo99, but there are many different elements, all of which have a different half life. For U235 thermal nuclear reaction, 72.24% of the fissile product has a half-life of less than 100 years while only 27.76% is over 1,000 years (surprisingly none of it is between 100 and 1,000 years) [9]. So most of this stuff will naturally decay away into safe and stable elements (many in weeks), while only a little actually remains for thousands of years. 3)Cost of building and Maintaining Nuclear Power. Currently (as of 2010), the cost of nuclear fuel for a single reload was $40 million [10]. Now, that may sound like a lot of money. But given that it only needs to be reloaded once every 18 months makes it very cheap indeed (about 0.65 cents per kWh). And with TWR which can use all of the U238, and not just a portion of enriched Uranium, their cost would be lower. In 2010, the average cost of operation and maintenance for a US reactor came in at about 1.49 cents per kWh. And that is with all of the government regulations (some of which are needed, but some of which are not). There are some other costs (like the Nuclear Waste Fund and such), but they come in at around 0.1 cents per kWh. This makes the fuel for nuclear power much cheaper than conventional gas or coal. The downside, is that nuclear power plants are more expensive to construct. Currently around $4,500 per kW, compared to Coal's $3,400 per kW or Natural Gas's $1,000 per kW [11]. == My Opponent's arguments == My opponent addresses two main points, disposal and environmental. 1) Disposal Disposal can be looked at in two aspects, safety of disposal and the breakdown period. The safety of the disposal is really already top notch. We can see the kind of testing and abuse they had to stand up to decades ago in the linked youtube video [12]. If we look into the breakdown period, the numbers may seem staggering, but really, it is far from the case. Let us first realize the small amount of waste that a nuclear power plant produces. Only 20 tons per plant per year [13], and that is before reprocessing. Back in my section 2, I showed that 80% can be reprocessed. This leaves only 4 tons of waste per plant per year. If the US used 100% nuclear energy, that would be a little shy of 500 plants, which would be only 2,000 tons per year. That may sound like a lot but lets put it into perspective, the Roosevelt Regional Landfill processes 8,300 ton of garbage every single day [14], and that is for a single landfill in the US. It has a 120 million ton capacity, meaning if it was dedicated to nuclear waste storage, it could hold 60,000 years worth of waste, and that is not considering the fact that the waste breaks down over time. 2) Environmental Acid rain is caused by a number of things, but nuclear energy is not one of them. The burning of fossil fuels, however, is a major contributor, since SO2 or NOx are the main causes [15]. But none of these are released by nuclear power plants. With this being said, I will turn the floor over to my opponent. Thank you [1] http://en.wikipedia.org... [2] http://en.wikipedia.org... [3] http://www-formal.stanford.edu...

nuclear energy,"I thank my opponent for his response. I would like to bring to my opponent’s attention that I will be leaving town Sunday and will not be able to continue this debate after that, so I hope that my opponent will be hasty in his responses so that this debate may conclude before then. My opponent’s first contention is that there are no suitable locations for nuclear power plants to be constructed. However, my opponent fails to realize several things. Firstly, regulations at both the state and federal level mean that nuclear power plants constructed in the United States are among the safest, most secure in the world. The plants are very resilient to natural disasters. For example, in the wake of Fukushima nuclear disaster several safety concerns were raised over U.S. nuclear facilities. One such plant was the Callaway Nuclear Plant near Fulton, Missouri which is located less than 500 miles away than one of the most active fault lines in North America: the New Madrid Fault. In the event that an earthquake caused damage to the facilities at Callaway there are several safety measures that could be activated to avert disaster, including: -Billions of gallons of fresh water from the Missouri River (which is located only a few miles away) could be pumped into the reactors to cool them -Backup diesel generators would supply emergency power, meaning that water could continue to be pumped into the reactors even if the plant had to be powered-down -The plant is capable of being powered down completely in several ways -Equipment at the Callaway site would detect any major, seismic activity and immediately power down the plant [1] In response to my opponent’s claim that U.S. nuclear facilities would be targets of terrorist activity, I will have to agree with him. Radical, Islamic terrorists would love to cause just a partial meltdown at a nuclear power plant near a major American city. However, once again precautions already in place would prevent such from happening. U.S. nuclear facilities are very secure in the sense that they have a 24-hour security presence and semi-restricted airspace exists around all U.S. nuclear facilities. In the post 9/11 world, the notion that anybody with malicious intentions could gain access to an American nuclear facility is simply speculative and unsubstantiated. As it is clear to see, the safety precautions at U.S. nuclear power sites help safeguard them from natural and man made disasters. By opponent’s second point of contention is that nuclear power plant’s require a large amount of monetary investment in the form of licensing and construction costs. However, I have some points that I would like to bring up in refutation of his argument. Firstly, one of the main goals of extra government investment into nuclear power would be the reduction of start-up costs. More government investment could lead to the formation of new, less costly construction techniques that would consequently increase the feasibility of nuclear power plant construction. One method by which government could lower the costs of nuclear power would be removing two-hurdle licensing and encouraging uniform design. Two-hurdle licensing is method of licensing still used in some states that require a license be obtained in order to construct the plant and an additional license be acquired to actually operate the plant. In some instances, this delayed the dates of the plants’ planned openings by several years resulting in additional, unseen costs. The worst case scenario happened at the Shoreham Plant on Long Island which was constructed but never allowed to operate. It is estimated that this cost New York taxpayers over five billion dollars [2]. By streamlining, the licensing process the government could lower costs associated with nuclear development. Even still though, the government could go a step further and encourage uniform design. Currently, all U.S. nuclear power plants are highly specific and use unique, one-of-a-kind equipment. This increases costs because it costs extra money to develop all of the unique equipment required for nuclear power plant construction. Also, it lengthens the construction process because all of the unique equipment has to be inspected and approved by federal regulators. By using tax credits and tax waivers, the federal government and state governments could encourage uniform design. [2] In his third contention, my opponent claims that investment should be directed towards cleaner, “greener” sources of energy. My opponent has made a mistake. He has assumed that by “investment” I mean additional funding into nuclear power plant development. However, by reviewing the definitions posted in Round 1--one can clearly see that the term “investment” does not just mean money. One way in which to increase investment in nuclear power would be to streamline and simplify the licensing process--something that would not require any additional funding. Secondly, my opponent claims that it is foolish to invest in nuclear power when so many “better” energy sources exist. However, more careful examination reveals some alarming facts about the practicality of wind energy. Windmills are extremely large, yet produce very little electricity. If the fully operable windmills in California, Texas, Minnesota, Iowa, Washington and Oregon were to run and produce electricity, the amount produced would be equal to one-third of 1% of the electricity produced in the United States in one year [3]. In addition, these wind farms impair environmental, ecological, scenic and property values, for obvious reasons. The bulk of the windmills become an eyesore in many scenic areas, may affect bird migration, and potentially would adversely impact ecological rarities. In his fourth point, my opponent brings up the environmental concerns related to nuclear waste and the availability of uranium resources. I agree with my opponent in saying that the waste produced by nuclear power plants is a real concern and that uranium and plutonium are not infinite resources. However, the nuclear waste problem is one that has been solved for quite some time. Regulations by the EPA, the DoE require that nuclear waste be disposed in such a manner that keeps it safe for at least one million years [4]. Burying the waste underground is a sensible means of disposal as it reduces its environmental impact while keeping it safely away from the human population. Also, as advances in technology continue one option that may become available for nuclear disposal is that nuclear waste be launched into outer space. Imagine, our nuclear waste hundreds of light-years away! How is disposal in this manner not environmentally friendly. My opponent also makes a point about the availability of uranium and plutonium--these things are not infinite resources. However, recent studies by independent agencies seem to suggest that the world holds more radioactive material than one might think. In fact, we have not reached “peak uranium” and new uranium deposits are being discovered everyday [5]. Also, recycled radioactive material form nuclear waste and decommissioned nuclear weapons serves as a major source of nuclear energy. While estimates are somewhat arbitrary, scientists predict that enough uranium exists in the world to sustain nuclear energy for several hundred years [5]. I would also like to point out to my opponent that he supplied no sources and did not even challenge my contentions. Thus, at this point I can claim to win by default. [1]http://www.kmov.com...

nuclear energy,"I thank my opponent for his argument. I will quickly dive into mine now. 1) Effectiveness. My opponent has admitted to passing on the effectiveness argument, choosing to focus on different potential short comings. As to save space, I will leave this as is and also focus on the different potentail short comings. 2) Safety. With this, I will break this down into two subsections, technical safety (a), and political safety (b). a) Normally, we would dismiss the mentioning of TMI (Three Mile Island), Chernobyl, and Fukushima as cases of spotlighting fallacies rather than accurate representations of the technology. Such fallacies would be like saying cars should not be allowed because the Ford Pinto was unsafe. However, for any engineer, it is vital to learn from mistakes so that they cannot happen again (when there are actually mistakes). Just like they learned from the Pinto to make a better, safer car, we too can learn from these three incidents how to make a better reactor. So we will actually look at each of these individually, as well as the safety record in whole of nuclear reactors. Going by year, we will first look at TMI, 1979 [1][2]. This was an incident that started because a relief valve became stuck open, causing the cooling fluids to leave the reactor. This was compounded by the fact that an operator mistook the lack of cooling fluid as too much cooling fluid, thus opening more values to let more out. The reactor over heated and the core melted (refered to as a meltdown), however, the melted core never breached the containment walls and was cooled back down by the automated system (all people had evacuated by then). A follow up report, the Komeny report [3], showed that no one had died from the radation releases, and that the releases were of a quantity that they would not have any measurable effect on the people in ther area. What have we learned from TMI [4][5]? We learned many things from TMI that have allowed us to not have a repeat, even though the damage from TMI was actually rather minor (apart from damage to the reactor itself). From improved training, better communication, and better configuration of the control rooms to allow better understanding of issues and faster, more accurate reaction from personnel. Moving on to the next, Chernobyl, 1986 [6]. Chernobyl is a unique disaster, that given the secrecy of the USSR at the time (we didn't even know about the incident until we discovered radioactive material in the air in Sweden). Chernobyl was using an RBMK style reactor [7], which the US and most of the western world knew was unsafe because of the use of a void coefficient and their particular fuel rod set up. With the reactor styles we have now, a Chernobyl style incident is not physically possible, even if someone got into the reactor control and tried to make it happen [8]. The latest, Fukushima, 2011. Fukushima is most definiately a spotlight example. While most of the others we look at and say ""what went wrong,"" which Fukushima, we can look at and say ""Holy crude, why didn't more go wrong?"" Fukushima reactors were all over 30 years old, with some over 40 years old. They we hit by a 9.0 earth quake followed shortly by a 50 foot tsunami. Yet somehow, they managed to hold out (about as well as Rocky did in his first movie). While most of the reactors ended up melting down from a disaster that would cripple any structure in the world, they've done a fair job contianing that material. While some radiation does escape, just like some did at TMI, there are no recorded deaths from the radiation, either on the plant, nor in the general public. And from this, we've been able to learn where the reactor had issues, and how to improve upon them going forward. Since accidents are learning opportunities, to see what you may have overlooked and places to do better, they can actually be very helpful to us. And in cases where the accident has no serious harm to society, the minor accidents can be viewed as possitives, so that we can get better at preventing the big accidents that do cause serious harm. Now I will look at the safety risks of aggressive nations having nuclear energy. My opponent points out that nations, such as Iran and North Korea, will hide their nuclear facilities, and as a result, may cut corners with them. This is not a good argument against nuclear energy, since it is the very prohibition of the nuclear energy that is causing them to be unsafe. By opening up, showing them the safe ways and the unsafe ways, and even helping them build them it has many benefits. 1) Safer power plants 2) Better relations between nations 3) More energy for the nation to help people get out of poverty and build their economy 4) More power to the people to fight against dicatorships Since electricity is needed to clean water, power hospitals, develop medicenes, run industry, and provide heat and air conditioning for people, it is vital to bettering the lives of the people in those nations, and thus bettering the relation between them and us. 3) Costs To answer my opponent's question regarding why more energy isn't done by nuclear energy, I have two responces. First, this isn't really a legitimate question. One could easly through this question upon his suggested alternatives, that since solar makes up so little energy, it must not be effective. In reality, better ideas, always take time to replace the status quo, and simply because something is being used used more commonly does not mean that it is more effective. The second part of the answer is a lack of knowledge, combined with false knowledge. In regards to nuclear energy, it is often called the China Syndrome, in reference to a 1979 movie (which came out only months before TMI), that showed nuclear reactors as bombs just waiting to go off. Since more people get their views from hollywood than from sciencewood, they are going to have opinions based on incorrect knowledge. While many African and Latin American nations are not wealthy enough to produce nuclear, by us generating more nuclear, that cuts the demand for natural gas and coal (and other fuels). This drop in demand, turns into a drop in cost of those materials, and the drop in cost will help the people in those poorer nations. Moving on to the alternatives that my opponent has listed, I will quickly address them one by one (1,500 characters left, sorry). Hydro - Hydro is limited by rivers, while many nations do have a lot of rivers, many do not, and so hydro is not adequate for them. Hydro also takes much longer to build, as it develops the entire ecosystem around it (turning a river into a lake). Solar - While solar is my ultimate energy fav, it too has its limits. Many northern nations are going to find solar to be less than ideal. Even here in Oregon, we find that it is only the edge. As only getting 5 sun hours a day (on average over a year), one would need 4,800 MW solar field to equal the same as a single 1,000 MW nuclear (or coal, or natural gas, or anything that can run 24 hours a day). Move up into Canada or other northern nations, and that can stretch into 8,000 MW of solar to match the single 1,000 MW of nuclear. Wind - similar to solar. Kenetic - The generators that are listed are standard fuel generators. I'm not sure what Kenetic Generators are and could not find them on a quick search. But those that you listed, show that the 15 kW model uses 1.36gal/hr. It doesn't say what the fuel is, but if it takes 1.36 gal to make 15 kW of energy, or 1 gal to make 11.03 kW, the fuel has to cost about $1.10 per gallon to be comparible. And even then, these only have 5 year warrenties, and so would need to be replaced and repaired more often [9].

nuclear energy,"We should not use nuclear power because it is very inefficient. According to MGX.com, nuclear power is not only dangerous, but also inefficient for these reasons: The inefficiencies discussed relating to the lower steam temperature necessary when using nuclear energy in order to avoid overheating the fuel rods do not include the additional costs of transmission and delivery. Transmission and delivery account for almost 70% of every utility bill because power plants are so far away from the end customer and because so many middlemen are involved with the final distribution. This does not occur with renewable energy that is produced at the location where it is demanded the most. Nuclear energy is not efficient, and there are more efficient forms of producing energy.

nuclear energy,"I thank my opponent for a very enjoyable debate and look forward to more in the future. In this final round, I will go ahead and first, address my opponent's round 3 arguments, and second, post a summary. 2) Safety. While the three accidents are worthy of mention, they do not provide logically reason to support that nuclear energy is unsafe, anymore so than arguing that the Ford Pinto supports that cars in general are unsafe. If anything, they show of individual cases where safety was comprimised due to design issues (as with the pinto), nature, or human error. And I did refer to each of these individually in the last round to show how we learned from them to help us make sure that they never repeat (just like we learned from the design flaws of the pinto to make sure we never make something like it again). Regarding the safe transport of nuclear waste, I encourage everyone to watch at least the first 45 seconds of the attached video [video]. Nuclear waste transportation is tested and tested and tested. There are not many things which are tested to the point where they are strapped to a rocket powered semi truck and rammed into a concrete wall to see if they stay intact. Going on to the safety of storing, remember that if we reporcess nuclear waste (as many other countries do), the waste will not have any actinides (like Pu239, U235, or U238, or Th232 and U233 in the Thorium cycle), making it much safer. To the point where you only need minimal protective gear (Enriched uranium can be handled by only a latex glove covered hands, it is the Pu239 in the un-processed waste that requires the full suits and robots). 3) Cost Cost has been shown that it is cheaper to run (once built) than all current fossil fuel power sources, and it is cheaper than all alternative energy sources in start up costs (with the exception of dams, however, their restriction of having to be on rivers makes their use limited, and unable to be a primary powersource for a large nation). My opponent has also stated that the cost would be too great for some poorer nations. This doesn't really make sense. Many people can't afford a Porche, does that mean no one should be allowed to have one? I've already shown that by having wealthy nations switch over to nuclear, that will free up some supply of coal and natural gas, which will bring the price down on those, and thus make them cheaper for the poorer nations and ultimately help them and their economy, as an indirect result of nuclear energy. Regarding the magentic generators, anyone and everyone should be instantly skeptical of anything that promises free fueless energy. Most of these claim to be based from ""the lost Tesla Generator"" which Tesla didn't view as practical and never rebuilt them after his wearhouse burnt down (while he did rebuild other inventions). Most of these are no more real than that Nigerian Prince wanting to give away some of his money, the same is true for all perpetual motion devices. Regarding the quote from Arthur Schopenhauer, such a saying is known as Galieo's gambit, a logical fallacy. While it is true that many ""truths"" are first laughed at, not everything that is laughed at is a ""truth."" Moving on to my closing summary. I have shown that the effectiveness of nuclear energy far surpasses that of any other power source, both in quantity of power, and in the locations it can be used. These went pretty much entirely unchallenged. For safety, the main concerns where several spotlighted examples, all of which were addressed in my round 3 and were not challenged in my opponent's round 3. For cost, we can see that nuclear energy has a higher start up cost, but much lower fuel cost, meaning that over the long run, it costs much less. And this will allow other nations to obtain other fuels at lower prices. Regarding the opponent's arguments on various alternatives, those were all addressed and none of the addresses countered (though the magnetic generators was explained in greater detail and was only addressed in this round, so my opponent can counter the address in his next round). With that, I end my rounds of this debate and await my opponent's closing round. Again, thank you for the debate. http://www.youtube.com...",PRO,"Going on to the safety of storing, remember that if we reporcess nuclear waste (as many other countries do), the waste will not have any actinides (like Pu239, U235, or U238, or Th232 and U233 in the Thorium cycle), making it",528
nuclear energy,"Nuclear energy should be used as a primary source of energy for many reasons. Costs being one of them. Nuclear energy costs 2 cents per Kilowatt-hour. This is a fraction compared to the other sources of energy. Oil being 18 cents Per KWh and gas being around 8 cents Per kWh. Over time nuclear energy proves to be much less expensive and more practical. Safety might be more of the controversial subjects when it comes to nuclear power. The problem is when fission occurs it is very difficult to stop. With today's technology the chance of a melt down is around .00026% for the average reactor life. If that meltdown is to occur it would be contained. All modern reactors have a containment building. A large dome completely surrounding the reactor. The containment consist of many feet of concrete and are able to withstand a collision with a fully loaded passenger airliner. Nuclear energy is a declared green energy, the nuclear fission produces two byproducts. One being steam and the other nuclear waste. Nuclear waste is safely contained in canisters that do not allow any radiation or leakage of the waste to reach the outside. In other words nuclear waste does not harm the environment in anyway. Also nuclear waste is can be recycled through a reactor as plutonium, this reduces the amount of nuclear waste as a byproduct. Other energies like fossil-fuel energies produce tons of Co2. Coal-fire energy is extremely dangerous to the environment and is harming it now. The strip mining that is needed for coal causes devastation to landscapes. Coal fire plants use tons and tons of coal per day. While nuclear reactors use fuel rods which consume only a few uranium pellets every 30 years. The numbers between the two energies just do not compare. Other alternative energies don't contend with nuclear power when it comes to being used on a large scale. Nuclear power plants take a few hundred acres to produce its typical 1,000 megawatts per hour. To equal one reactor you would need around 2400 turbines and 60,000 acres and of coarse wind is not always blowing. On average, wind turbines are working at full potential 25% of the time. And a nuclear reactor is always producing energy. To be realistic you would have to quadruple the acres and turbines to equal a reactor. So the numbers would be 9,800 turbines and 240,000 acres. To put it another way 240,000 acres is 375 square miles. And the square miles needed for a nuclear reactor is 2 . This is 1/187.5 fraction. For solar panels to match one reactor, the land needed would be around 5,000 acres. And again solar panels only reach peak energy levels 25% of the time. And again you would have to quadruple 5,000 acres. This would be 20,000 acres of land needed to reach 1000 megawatts per hour. This is a 1/15 fraction. Hydro electric power is just plain unfriendly to the environment. On one side of a dam a river is made much more shallow. The other side of the dam a reservoir is created and thousands of acres of land is flooded, forcing the natural habitat out.

nuclear energy,"Let's consider Pro's round two arguments in favor of nuclear energy: Amount The first of these is the amount of fuel available, and how long it could potentially last. The figures quoted here are so rubbery and based on speculation as to be pretty well meaningless. We are told that based on current consumption rates and current known supplies there is around 230 years worth of material remaining. This is fair enough. Then, we are told that using other sources of uranium, and other radioactive elements and isotopes that are not currently in use, and fission technologies that are not yet in production, the figure ""could"" be raised to thirty thousand years. That's a massive jump, and a lot of ""ifs"". Finally, Pro makes the claim that ""it may be so that, at current energy consumption, we could sustain ourselves for 1 million years on nuclear fission reactions alone."" This is a quantum leap from the thirty thousand quoted in the referenced article, and the source is not quoted. Pro, could you please provide the source of this claim? Pro closes his argument by stating ""Nuclear energy clearly has much greater reserves than fossil fuels, and energy that is always available, unlike renewables"". Unlike the elastic figures and speculation about future technologies used by the nuclear industry to estimate there may be around 30,000 years worth of atomic fuel left, we know for certain that ""The sun runs out of hydrogen fuel in its core about five billion years from now""[1]. Furthermore, since winds are caused by heating of the Earth by the sun, we know for certain without any speculation that there is five billion years worth of renewable energy left, regardless of how much is used. Efficiency According to Pro, ""Nuclear energy is cheaper and more efficient that other forms of energy, as it has a greater capacity factor and lower per unit energy costs than than other forms of energy, both fossil fuels and renewable."" This argument is just not true, as typically, figures quoted by nuclear energy producers look only at ongoing production costs, and ignore massive initial setup costs - for example $10 billion to construct a reactor, and clean up costs of up to hundreds of billions of dollars (as discussed in my round two argument) when something goes wrong. ""Cheap"" atomic energy is based largely on massive subsidies: ""Despite more than $150 billion in federal subsides over the past 60 years (roughly 30 times more than solar, wind and other renewable energy sources have received), nuclear power still costs substantially more than electricity made from wind, coal, oil or natural gas. This is mainly due to the cost of borrowing money for the decade or more it takes to get a nuclear plant up and running.""[2] Furthermore, private sector investors recognize that nuclear is not an economically viable energy option for the future: ""Nowhere [in the world] do market-driven utilities buy, or private investors finance, new nuclear plants."" Only continued massive government intervention is keeping the nuclear option alive.""[2] In summary, as Time Magazine eloquently puts it: ""private capital still considers atomic energy radioactive, gravitating instead toward natural gas and renewables, whose costs are dropping fast. Nuclear power is expanding only in places where taxpayers and ratepayers can be compelled to foot the bill.""[3] Environment This is where the pro nuclear lobby have to stretch the furthest. According to Pro, ""Nuclear energy actually has very little effect on the environment"". Perhaps Pro should try convincing the Navajo people, whose lands were used for uranium mining from 1944 til 1986, of that. It is no coincidence that ""Risk of lung cancer among male Navajo uranium miners was 28 times higher than in Navajo men who never mined""[4]. In addition, ""Rates of birth defects in babies born to Navajo women living in uranium mining areas in New Mexico and Arizona between 1964 and 1981 were 2 to 8 times the national averages, depending on the type of defect.""[4] Or perhaps he should try convincing the Scottish farmers of the ""minimal"" environmental impact of nuclear power generation: ""The direct consequences of the accident [Chernobyl] were felt in Scotland until 2010 when the last of the agricultural restrictions put in place following the catastrophe were lifted"".[5] But it isn't over yet. Even today, 28 years after Chernobyl, ""the country could still face contamination from the world's worst nuclear accident if the 1,600-mile exclusion zone around the now defunct power plant goes up in flames. The forests have been allowed to grow wild and unmanaged since the tragedy almost three decades ago and have continued to absorb contamination still evident in the area. Raising temperatures and lack of rain have now created a serious risk of a massive blaze, which could rage on for several days and have far-reaching consequences. Lack of resources mean spotting and putting out flames before they burn out of control is near impossible although a core group of volunteers is trying to do their best. Scientists in Scotland agree the prospect of redistribution of contaminated particles is ""very real""""[5]. The radioactive half life of products used in nuclear power generation ranges from tens of years to millions of years. Radioactive products which are left laying on the ground (tailings), or buried under the ground or ocean leave an environmental legacy that could last well beyond the life expectancy of the human race. And now I'd like to consider some additional arguments raised by Pro in round three: Firstly, we have this rather odd statement: ""The only real consideration for nuclear waste is the radioactivity and the potential threat to life that it creates. However, the considerations are not important"". Hopefully, this represents an unfortunate choice of words, and not really a total disregard of the many tens of thousands who have already died or will die as a result of accidents which have already occurred in the nuclear industry. Concerning storage of nuclear by products, various solutions are being explored globally; but no permanent solutions have been implemented. One pro-nuclear source admits: ""Currently, no country has a complete system for storing high level waste permanently"".[6] Regarding transportation of nuclear waste, Pro states that ""elaborate packaging"" reduces the chance of a catastrophe to almost none. It would be interesting to see the ""probabilistic risk analysis"" on which these figures were based, but it is not essential, because the argument ignores the most significant factor - the potential for terrorism. As I pointed out in round two, this month has seen the first recorded instance of a deliberate attack on a nuclear reactor. Particularly with the increasing use of drone technology, the potential for an attack on radioactive materials during transport is a very real, and very frightening possibility. And no amount of ""elaborate packaging"" will be effective against a missile attack. The remaining arguments from Pro in this round seem to be, in the main, denials of plain facts on the dangers of radioactivity from the nuclear industry. For example: - ""Miners of radioactive materials are actually much safer than are popularly believed"". - ""As for genetic mutations, again, while the risk is there, the dangers and probabilities of receiving any adverse effects are small."" - ""As for nuclear disasters, these are actually very rare"" - "" "" core melting and containment failure "" can cause few if any deaths to the public, regardless of the scenario that led to the core melt and containment failure."" All of these claims are contradicted by facts that I have raised in round two. Rather than refute them again here, I will refer to them in the last round when I summarise our respective cases. And finally, on the subject of economic viability, Pro cites an article by the Nuclear Energy Institute in saying: "" ""Analysis shows that every dollar spent by the average nuclear plant results in the creation of $1.04 in the local community, $1.18 in the state economy and $1.87 in the U.S. economy."" A big cost equals an even bigger gain"". Again, this claim by a major interest group is simply smoke and mirrors. It refers to the yearly ""economic output"" from a typical nuclear power generator, and claims it to be in the order of $470 million dollars per year. Yet what is not factored into this is the cost to construct the reactor in the first place. Even allowing for only $8 billion dollars which is claimed in the article, this gives an interest bill alone (at a modest 5%) of over $400 million dollars per year, which virtually wipes out all profits made. In comparison to this, renewable energy sources have negligible construction costs and vastly lower operating costs. References: [1] http://ds9.ssl.berkeley.edu...

Alternative Energy: any energy sources except for coal and oil. 1a) Energy from the wind only cost .2c cents/kWh. This is cheaper than nuclear cost 2 cents per kWh. Therefore, overtime wind turbines are cheaper than nuclear power plants. ""Nuclear energy averages 0.4 euro cents/kWh, much the same as hydro, coal is over 4.0 cents (4.1-7.3), gas ranges 1.3-2.3 cents and only wind shows up better than nuclear, at 0.1-0.2 cents/kWh average.

""A serious nuclear accident could cost more than $600 billion in 2004 dollars[2] - taxpayers would be responsible for covering the vast majority of that sum."" 2) Nuclear power-plant must be built near a large source of water to cool the system. This not only disrupts the ecosystem by changing water temperature but also there is a chance of a radiation leakage into the water, thus contaminating the source and the consumers. ""High risks: Despite a generally high security standard, accidents can still happen. It is technically impossible to build a plant with 100% security. A small probability of failure will always last. The consequences of an accident would be absolutely devastating both for human being as for the nature (see here , here or here ). The more nuclear power plants (and nuclear waste storage shelters) are built, the higher is the probability of a disastrous failure somewhere in the world.""-(TimeForChange.org) 3) Nuclear is not a green energy. Over time of extensive use of nuclear will produce steam (energy), steam will then steady increase global warming. Recyclable nuclear byproducts are currently under experiments, not only that but it is cheaper to buy new sources than to recycle nuclear waste. Nuclear mining and enrichment is dangerous to the environment through mutation. Nuclear reactors do not use only a few grams of uranium, they use by the ton. If reactors were to use only a few grams, we would not be fussing over waste disposal. 4) The US has excess unused land, especially in the desert.

""There are many dams along the Colorado River, but not all of them produce electricity. In fact, the main reason the Hoover Dam was built and is operating today is not for its electricity production. The Hoover Dam and the other 50+ dams help control the Colorado River. That is, they control floods, irrigate crops, supply drinking water, make places for recreation, create habitat for wildlife, and generate electricity. Lake Mead, located behind the wall at Hoover Dam is the most important part of the Dam. It is the biggest man-made lake in the United States and provides drinking water to Los Angeles, San Diego, and Phoenix. Las Vegas gets almost all of its water from Lake Mead. While the electricity that Hoover Dam generates is important, living out here in the desert would be impossible without the flowing water of the Colorado River.""-(http://www.eia.doe.gov...) Con's case: 1) Nuclear waste is costly and harmful. It take at least 10,000 years for uranium to be a bit safe. Maintaining these waste disposal is costly. Over 10,000 years? Overtime the cost will outweigh its benefits. 2) Dismantling a nuclear plant is very costly, more than solar panels and wind turbines. 3) Nuclear terrorism involving the waste are high and risky. Increasing usage would produce more waste and thus increasing the chances of nuclear waste being stolen and use as weapons known as the dirty bomb. ""A direct hit by a penetrating 1,000-pound explosive (or equivalent) would likely inflict damage that would disperse tons of radioactive material. ""Destruction of the main feed pump or steam lines,"" says David Rossin, a nuclear expert at Stanford's Center for International Security and Cooperation, ""could create problems of decay heat and produce the release of fission products."" Perhaps the most vulnerable nuclear material is in the spent fuel storage pool, according to Rossin, where unloaded core material does not have the same degree of protection as does the reactor core"" 4) Uranium is not renewable.

nuclear energy,"My first argument is that a nuclear reactor can't explode as a nuclear weapon. Nuclear weapons require uranium-235 or plutonium-239. When the nucleus splits, the huge energy comes from the enormous forces that hold the nucleus together. To split the nucleus of uranium, all you have to do is hit it gently with a neutron. When a nucleus is broken, the pieces fly apart with great energy. The energetic breakup is called fission. Typically, two large fission fragments and two additional neutrons fly out. The extra neutrons fissions in other nearby nuclei. Four mour neutrons emerge, followed by 8, 16, 32 and so on. Each doubling is called a generation. The whole process is called a chain reaction. The kinetic energy of the fission fragments is turned into heat, vaporizing all nearby material, and that's what makes the explosion. Well, the physics of the nuclear reactor is very similar to that od nuclear bombs, that why people fear them. In both, the energy is released from a chain reaction of uranium-235 or plutonium-239. The bomb uses doubling to get all the fission to take place in a millionth of a second. In contrast, the reactor uses a sustained chain reaction, with no doubling (I skip the explaination on how this works just to make the argument shorter, if you want i can explain it). In the reactor fission releases two or three neutrons, but on average only one of those goes on to hit another nucleus and trigger another fission, so the rate of reaction doesn't grow. Energy is released at a constant rate, heats water, and produces steam, which in turn runs a turbine that runs a generator that produces electricity. A nuclear reactor CANNOT explode like an atomic bomb. The physics reason for the safety of the nuclear power reactor is the fact that the presence of lots of the uranium-238 in the core means that the nuclear chain reaction will stop if the neutrons are not moderated. Unless the neutron are slowed down, they will be absorbed by uranium-238 and the chain reaction will cease. This are the physics involved in the nuclear power. I explained it as simply as I could and without making it to long to read it. To finish my argument, i would like to repeat my main idea: Nuclear reactor can't explode as an atomic bomb does.",PRO,"My first argument is that a nuclear reactor can't explode as a nuclear weapon.

nuclear energy,"I would like to thank my opponent for accepting this debate and look forward to a wonder debate on the merits of Nuclear Energy. This is going to be a very broad debate, and so it is likely that we will be using all of our characters before saying all that we wish to say. So in order to maximize what we say in our limited space, I will try to keep this as organized as possible. My argument is going to break down into three separate categories. Effectiveness, Safety, and Cost. 1)Effectiveness of Nuclear Energy Nuclear reactors generate electricity though good ol' fashion steam driven generators (the two most common reactors are the PWR [1] and the BWR [2]). The only thing that the nuclear material is used for is heating up the water and turning it into steam. This may sound like old technology (steam locomotives are a thing of old cowboy movies, not modern society), but with modern technology, it is quite capable of generating immense amounts of usable energy with very little input. Since the water that is turned to steam can be cooled and condensed, the water can be reused, and so never needs to be replaced. This means that the only thing that needs to be replaced is the nuclear fuel and parts through general wear and tear (usually the generator, since it has the most moving parts). The nuclear fuel can last about 2 years before needing to be replaced in modern power plants [3]. However, new designs, such as the TWR [4] are designed so that they can go decades between refueling and can even use fuel that was once viewed as waste (only using a small amount of U235, and a vast majority of U238). Your average nuclear reactor produces around 1,000 MW of power, and many power plants will have several reactors on site. The average American home uses 920 kWh per month [5]. This means that a single nuclear reactor (at 1,000 MW) can provide power for about 800,000 homes (exact number is 794,021.7). 2)Safety of nuclear energy and its waste Everyone knows that nuclear material can be dangerous to your health if you are directly exposed to it. This is why nuclear power plants go to crazy lengths to protect people for as much risk as they can. In PWRs, along with many computerized safety systems, the nuclear material is removed from the environment by two layers of the functioning reactor. While in the BWR, the water that the reactor is in is only removed by one layer. Emerging styles, like the PBMR [6] that use silicon carbide for friction protection, are essentially meltdown proof, as should the reactor lose power, the natural flow of the gases in the reactor would prevent a meltdown. When it comes to the waste, reprocessing can eliminate around 80% of it, though it isn't a flat 80% that is being removed. It is basically digging through the waste and gathering the remaining U238 and the Pu239 that forms and is not fissiled away. Originally, we only reprocessed to gather the Pu239 in order to make bombs (shame on us and Russia… and everyone else that copied us afterwards), but that Pu239 can be used as fuel. What aren't reused in the waste are all the Cs, Rb, I, and other fissile products. While those are still dangerous and need to be handled with care, the biggest bad boy in the waste is actually the Pu239 (partially because it will turn to the super evil Radon gas). The rest is bad, but not nearly close to Pu. This means that by reprocessing it, it actually makes less waste, and makes it safer for the whole family (not recommended for children under 10, the elderly, pregnant women, or human skin in general). We also have a wonderful option in new technologies that are developing such as nuclear decay reactors (NDR) [8], which allow us to take radioactive waste, place it in a modified reactor and simply turn the heat that comes off of it into electricity. The other option is to take the waste away and bury it. Now, if the waste is reprocessed, all the Pu239, U238, and any U235 still in it, are removed. So all we have left is the fissile product. The most common of which is Cs133, I135, Zr93 and Mo99, but there are many different elements, all of which have a different half life. For U235 thermal nuclear reaction, 72.24% of the fissile product has a half-life of less than 100 years while only 27.76% is over 1,000 years (surprisingly none of it is between 100 and 1,000 years) [9]. So most of this stuff will naturally decay away into safe and stable elements (many in weeks), while only a little actually remains for thousands ofyears. 3)Cost of building and Maintaining Nuclear Power. Currently (as of 2010), the cost of nuclear fuel for a single reload was $40 million [10]. Now, that may sound like a lot of money. But given that it only needs to be reloaded once every 18 months makes it very cheap indeed (about 0.65 cents per kWh). And with TWR which can use all of the U238, and not just a portion of enriched Uranium, their cost would be lower. In 2010, the average cost of operation and maintenance for a US reactor came in at about 1.49 cents per kWh. And that is with all of the government regulations (some of which are needed, but some of which are not). There are some other costs (like the Nuclear Waste Fund and such), but they come in at around 0.1 cents per kWh. This makes the fuel for nuclear power much cheaper than conventional gas or coal. The downside, is that nuclear power plants are more expensive to construct. Currently around $4,500 per kW, compared to Coal's $3,400 per kW or Natural Gas's $1,000 per kW [11].

nuclear energy,"For me nuclear energy is not necessary for the following factors. 1.Economically:- Nuclear power plants normally have very high capital costs for building the plants and why to build these plants when conventional sources of energy such as electricity are available at very low cost,the cost of fuel is also rising day by day.The cost of uranium has also increased .In May 2009 an update of a heavily-referenced 2003 MIT study was published. This said that ""since 2003 construction costs for all types of large-scale engineered projects have escalated dramatically. The estimated cost of constructing a nuclear power plant has increased at a rate of 15% per year heading into the current economic downturn. This is based both on the cost of actual builds in Japan and Korea and on the projected cost of new plants planned for in the United States. Capital costs for both coal and natural gas have increased as well, although not by as much. The cost of natural gas and coal that peaked sharply is now receding. Taken together, these escalating costs leave the situation [of relative costs] close to where it was in 2003."" The overnight capital cost was given as $4000/kW, in 2007 dollars. Applying the same cost of capital to nuclear as to coal and gas, nuclear came out at 6.6 c/kWh, coal at 8.3 cents and gas at 7.4 cents, assuming a charge of $25/tonne CO2 on the latter. Uranium: 8.9 kg U3O8 x $146 US$ 1300 Conversion: 7.5 kg U x $13 US$ 98 Enrichment: 7.3 SWU x $155 US$ 1132 Fuel fabrication: per kg US$ 240 Total, approx: US$ 2770 2. Environment:- If we see environmentally high level radioactive waste are being left open in the rivers,seas and other water bodies because of which many rare species of fishes fishes are being killed at a faster rate ,the nuclear fleet creates about 100,000 metric tons of solid waste yearly also these wastes are not being removed regularly because of which the environmental conditions are depleting at a faster rate. 3.Risks:-The principal risks associated with nuclear power arise from health effects of radiation. This radiation consists of subatomic particles traveling at or near the velocity of light---186,000 miles per second. They can penetrate deep inside the human body where they can damage biological cells and thereby initiate a cancer. If they strike sex cells, they can cause genetic diseases in progeny.Radiation occurs naturally in our environment; a typical person is, and always has been struck by 15,000 particles of radiation every second from natural sources, and an average medical X-ray involves being struck by 100 billion. While this may seem to be very dangerous, it is not, because the probability for a particle of radiation entering a human body to cause a cancer or a genetic disease is only one chance in 30 million billion (30 quintillion). http://en.wikipedia.org.... http://en.wikipedia.org....",CON,"Taken together, these escalating costs leave the situation [of relative costs] close to where it was in 2003."" ... http://en.wikipedia.org.... http://en.wikipedia.org....",536

According to a Nuclear Energy Education article on eHow, While nuclear power plants operate under strict safety codes and emergency procedures, there is no way to fully protect them from natural disasters, terrorist attacks or mere human error. One problem is radiation exposure because no matter how rare, reactor meltdowns and explosions have occurred on a number of occasions, most recently in early March 2011 as part of the tsunami aftermath in Japan. Not only may the explosions themselves cause immense damage, but harmful radiation leaks can cause deadly aftereffects. Radiation can cause mutations or destroy cells in your body. For example, according to Wikipedia, because of the Nuclear Power Plant in Fukushima, Japan about 37 people who were within the 20-30 km zone were affected by the radiation and got diseases. About 2 people got radiation burns and were taken to the hospital. Since nuclear energy is highly hazardous and causes damage that is not worth the benefits, nuclear energy should not be used, as it is doing more harm than good. Since this is my last argument, I want to thank you for debating with me.",PRO,"This point is not only cited by private individuals but also credible organizations. ...

nuclear energy,"I would like to thank diddleysquat for presenting his arguments. In this round, I will be addressing my opponent's three arguments against nuclear energy. Dirty To begin with, I will give a quote I provided in the first round, ""Because uranium contains many thousands of times more energy per unit of weight than fossil fuels, the waste from a nuclear power station is very small in volume and is fully managed and extremely secure at the nuclear sites."" In other words, pro's first argument doesn't really present a problem. Sure, that amount of waste may seem like a lot, but in reality, it pales in comparison to waste from other forms of energy, such as coal-fired plants.[1] The only real consideration for nuclear waste is the radioactivity and the potential threat to life that it creates. However, the considerations are not important. ""Storage ponds at reactors, and those at centralized facilities such as CLAB in Sweden, are 7-12 metres deep, to allow several metres of water over the used fuel comprising racked fuel assemblies typically about 4 m long and standing on end. The circulating water both shields and cools the fuel. These pools are robust constructions made of thick reinforced concrete with steel liners. Ponds at reactors are often designed to hold all the used fuel for the life of the reactor."" Putting the nuclear waste deep underground presents an even safer, long-term option, and unlike my opponent's claims, isolates the radioactivity from the biosphere, and eliminates any potential adverse effects. ""This immobilises the radioactive elements in HLW and some ILW and isolates them from the biosphere.""""This method of disposal offers an assured means to isolate UNF-HLW and ILW over time periods sufficiently long to preclude any adverse impact on life on the Earth's surface. Repository plans generally allow for retrieval of nuclear waste, at least for an extended period of time. But the designs also provide for safe isolation even without human management.""[2][3] As for statistical evidence of danger to the public, ""Potential problems from accidents in transport of radioactive materials are largely neutralized by elaborate packaging. A great deal of such transport has taken place over the past 50 years and there have been numerous accidents, including fatal ones. However, from all of these accidents combined, there is less than a 1% chance that even a single death will ever result from radiation exposure. Probabilistic risk analyses indicate that we can expect less than one death per century in U.S. from this source.""[10] Dangerous Miners of radioactive materials are actually much safer than are popularly believed, especially with the internal and external regulation because of scientific findings, and the occupation can actually be considered safe. ""The revised occupational exposure limit is 20 millisieverts per year averaged over five consecutive years... the weight of scientific evidence does not indicate any cancer risk or immediate effects at doses below ablout 50 millisievert (mSv) per year.""[4] As for genetic mutations, again, while the risk is there, the dangers and probabilities of receiving any adverse effects are small. ""The estimated risk of permanent damage to a second generation (grandchild) individual is 0.02 cases per million Micro-Sievert [ or around 20 cases per million milli-sievert] of exposure."" As can be seen, the dangers of working in radioactive mining, while larger than the average dose received by someone not working in the industry, is small compared to the doses needed for bodily abnormality.[5] But what of the dangers of working in nuclear reactors, or more importantly, the danger to individuals not involved in the nuclear energy process at all? The risks are much lower. ""Despite popular belief, nuclear plants are relatively safe. For years, America's commercial nuclear energy industry has ranked among the safest places to work in the United States. In 2000, its industrial safety accident rate-which tracks the number of accidents that result in lost work time, restricted work or fatalities-was 0.26 per 200,000 worker-hours. By comparison, the accident rate for US private industry was 3.1 per 200,000 worker-hours in 1998... Even if you lived right next door to a nuclear power plant, you would still receive less radiation each year than you would receive in just one round-trip flight from New York to Los Angeles. You would have to live near a nuclear power plant for over 2,000 years to get the same amount of radiation exposure that you get from a single diagnostic medical x-ray."" All and all, nuclear energy has a very low rate of potential danger to anyone involved or not involved in the process of its production. The radiation dose to the public is less than one milli-sieverts a year.[6] As for nuclear disasters, these are actually very rare. Only three major instances ever occurred, once of which (Three Mile Island) was fully contained, another (Fukushima) resulted in no deaths, and the other (Chernobyl) was more the result of major design deficiencies and bad safety measures in place with Soviet nuclear reactors. ""These are the only major accidents to have occurred in over 15,000 cumulative reactor-years of commercial nuclear power operation in 33 countries."" Overall, none of these is a case against modern nuclear power plants.[7] Finally, on terrorism, the chances (it's never happened) and consequences are very small. ""But further (see Sept 2002 Science paper and Jan 2003 Response & Comments), realistic assessments from decades of analyses, lab work and testing, find that the consequence of even the worst realistic scenarios "" core melting and containment failure "" can cause few if any deaths to the public, regardless of the scenario that led to the core melt and containment failure.""[7] Overall, coal plants cause 342 deaths per TW (terawatt, 10^12 watts), natural gas 85 deaths per TW, hydro 883 deaths per TW, and wind around 1000 deaths per TW (with regression analysis), while nuclear only causes 8 deaths per TW. It hardly seems appropriate to call nuclear the most dangerous of energy sources.[7][8] Expensive My opponent's first arguments rest on the three accidents mentioned earlier. Again, considering the amount of nuclear energy used over the years, that amount is small compared to damages to plants of other forms of energy, especially coal and hydroelectric (the latter of which requires the massive rerouting of capital). As for actual power plant cost, my opponent has not considered my opening arguments, and I'm interested to see what he'll have to say in this round. I will simply make one point here. ""Analysis shows that every dollar spent by the average nuclear plant results in the creation of $1.04 in the local community, $1.18 in the state economy and $1.87 in the U.S. economy."" A big cost equals an even bigger gain.[9] Sources [1]: http://www.cna.ca... [2]: http://www.world-nuclear.org... [3]: http://www.world-nuclear.org... [4]: http://www.world-nuclear.org...

nuclear energy,"Rebuttals: Pro has already admitted that there are ""cons"" to using nuclear, and as I've outlined in round one--it appears to be quite evident that these ""Cons"" outweigh the ""Pros"". The main Con being the huge expensive of nuclear energy; especially when it comes to establishing nuclear power plants. Pro states that ""other countries"" are doing fine with using nuclear energy but fails to reference what these countries actually are and provide any source to support their assertion. Moreover, this doesn't answer exactly how nuclear energy should be expanded. Just because other counties in the world have nuclear energy [this should be obvious anyway] it doesn't provide a credible reason for it to be expanded. Especially if we're speaking in terms of it being ""expanded"" regionally, like the U.K or U.S expanding its nuclear. What other parts of the world have in this example is simply irrelevant. As for not using the weapons that we currently have, Pro entirely misses the point here. The fact is that nuclear weapons have been used twice by the U.S and contributed to almost 200,000 people being killed--which Pro has dropped from my round one argument. Nuclear has been used on a large-scale in history and could very well be used again if certain circumstances were to arise. In this kind of event, millions of lives could potentially be lost and as with Japan, the suffering and damage caused could be extremely prolonged. And this is only referring to war examples, in round one I highlighted how drastically nuclear energy can impact people when there's been nuclear accidents, the direct effect of nuclear waste when it's exposed to people is in fact severe. To conclude my rebuttals, Con has practically dropped each contention of mine--including the environmental impacts and case[s] of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, as well as the significantly high costs of nuclear. I used a number of eight sources in support of my arguments, all of which Pro has ignored and seemingly not looked at. Instead of responding with a full argument on as to why nuclear should be expanded, they've exclusively gone over the same points and repeated their first round. I'd note that the BoP is on Pro to affirm their resolution and show how nuclear energy should indeed be expanded. So far, no sources have been used and no real case has been made.",CON,"Especially if we're speaking in terms of it being ""expanded"" regionally, like the U.K or U.S expanding its nuclear. ...

nuclear energy,"I would like to thank diddleysquat for this great debate. Amount The 30,000 year figure comes from fast-breeder reactors, which create their own fuel through a process called a breeding reaction. In one example, uranium-238 (the stable, and therefore currently unusable, isotope of uranium) is bombarded with a neutron, creating a uranium-239, which goes through two beta-decays to plutonium-239, which is another fissionable material. Uranium-238 is much more abundant than uranium-235. ""...the non-fissionable uranium-238 is 140 times more abundant than the fissionable U-235."" So this means that 140 times more fuel can be generated than with uranium-235, and this is where the 30,000 figure comes from.[1] The 1 million year figure comes from a rough estimation of all the fissionable materials available plus the amount of breeder reaction product fissionable material. Again, there are many different fissionable isotopes and many other atoms able to make a fissionable material through a breeder reaction. Further, there are unconventional extraction methods, such as from seawater. ""...the extraction of uranium from seawater would make available 4.5 billion metric tons of uranium""60,000-year supply at present rates."" It seems possible that there are 1 million years worth of fissionable and potentially fissionable materials on the Earth, and likely that the number at least closely approaches it.[2] But after 1 million years, we will surely a purely sustainable source of power (nuclear fusion?), and renewables currently are no where near sustainable. For example, to be sustainable in solar, one would have to cover 1% of the Earth in Silicon solar panels. The surface area of the Earth is around 510 million square miles, 1% of which is around 5.1 million square miles, which is about half the size of the US, and this assumes that the area will be sunny 100% of the time. In addition, you'd have to create storage areas and power distribution centers, which are currently beyond our capacities (solar energy can only be used locally). Similar problems accompany wind, and hydro harms the environment horribly. Overall, renewables are not sustainable at this moment. We have to find some other source for the time being and nuclear has the longest-available supplies.[3][Google search of surface area of the Earth and US] Efficiency It is true that the capital costs to build a nuclear power plant are high, but when the price per unit energy is considered, it is a good investment. Here is a graph that breaks down the cost of nuclear, gas, coal, and wind energy into different categories, including start-up costs: ""The relatively high capital cost of nuclear power means that financing cost and time taken in construction are critical, relative to gas and even coal. But the fuel cost is very much lower, and so once a plant is built its cost of production is very much more predictable than for gas or even coal."" This is once of the problems with investment in nuclear power, which I will explain more in depth later.[4] Nuclear is competitive in operating and management costs because of the low cost of fuel compared to fossil fuel power plants and because of the low cost of operating and management itself for renewables. Fossil fuels also have to contend with carbon taxes, increasing the costs of the energy they produce.[4][5] Overall, ""August 2003 figures put nuclear costs at EUR 2.37 c/kWh, coal 2.81 c/kWh and natural gas at 3.23 c/kWh (on the basis of 91% capacity factor, 5% interest rate, 40 year plant life). With emission trading @ EUR 20/t CO2, the electricity prices for coal and gas increase to 4.43 and 3.92 c/kWh respectively."" The OCED study mentioned that everywhere, nuclear power is cheaper than wind energy as well. The problems with solar were already mentioned. This graph shows costs for major low-carbon energies; it is clearly lower than (on average) all other forms of renewable energies[4][6]: So why the decline in nuclear power investment? It has to deal with start up capital. Ellen Vancko, nuclear project manager for the Union of Concerned Scientists, says that, ""They [investors] can buy them much more cheaply than they can build them."" Nuclear power plants are currently still profitable after they have been built, and they depreciate in value, making it better to upgrade old ones than build new ones. New, appliable technologies don't look profitable yet. There will come a time when building new nuclear power plants will become profitable again. Take the breeder reactors mentioned earlier. ""Breeder reactors, which will become more economical in 50-100 years, will eventually appear and eliminate all supply issues."" Overall, the decline in investment in nuclear power is not a sign of its inefficiency, and it will rise again.[7][8] Environment My opponent's mining studies are old and are the result of bad mining practices. Since then, the safety of miners has increased dramatically. I won't repeat the quotes I provided in the last round, as they speak for themselves. However, I will add, ""The maximum dose received is about half of the 20 mSv/yr limit and the average is about one tenth of it."" If you remember my last round arguments, the instances of cancer only rise after 50 mSv per year, which miners don't even get close to reaching.[9] Using Chernobyl as an argument against nuclear power is sloppy. Chernobyl was the result of extraordinary circumstances, none of which have to do with the safety of nuclear energy. ""The April 1986 disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in the Ukraine was the result of major design deficiencies in the RBMK type of reactor, the violation of operating procedures and the absence of a safety culture."" Chernobyl was not the result of dangers inherent in nuclear energy generation, but rather in easily correctable errors in operation and management. Apart from Chernobyl, there has been no accident even remotely close to this magnitude.[10] What I meant by ""important"" is not that the considerations are irrelevant no matter the cost, but that the costs are very low Once again, nuclear energy causes fewer deaths than any other form of energy. If my opponent is holding out for some major catastrophe that dwarfs Chernobyl, then he will probably be disappointed as safety measures continue to rise, plants become cleaner, and more effective (i.e. more power for less material) plants come. The chart ins source 11 shows even more forms of energy and their respective death risks, and as can be seen, nuclear has the lowest of them all. On top of that, deaths are projected to decrease even further with the new generation of power plants. ""All new builds must be Gen III and higher, with passive redundant safety systems, and all must be able to withstand the worst case disaster, no matter how unlikely."" I'm not sure why my opponent keeps arguing about the deadly risks of nuclear power when I've pointed out several times it's safety record.[11] As for nuclear waste disposal, my opponent forgot the rest of the quote. ""...but many have plans to do so in the next 10 years. There are a number of well-developed proposals from the USA, Sweden, Finland and France for the disposal of long-lived radio-active waste. All the proposed disposal techniques employ multiple barriers, as discussed above, to isolate the waste from the biosphere for at least 100,000 years. [And by then, the radioactivity would have deteriorated]"" This happens well in nature, such as with the Oklo reactor.[12] On the potential terrorist threat, the way nuclear reactors are designed is strong enough to prevent a general terrorist attack. In the very unlikely case that the containment chamber, there would not be any immediate effects, and the site could be contained before any long term effects would occur. ""The study of a 1970s US power plant in a highly-populated area is assessing the possible effects of a successful terrorist attack which causes both meltdown of the core and a large breach in the containment structure "" both extremely unlikely. It shows that a large fraction of the most hazardous radioactive isotopes, like those of iodine and tellurium, would never leave the site... The extent and timing of this [if it does leak] means that with walking-pace evacuation inside this radius it would not be a major health risk.""[10] Conclusion Nuclear energy is cheap, safe, efficient, and its potential is great. Overall, it represents a very good option for energy, and the time that we have the sufficient materials, we will certainly have found something else, maybe even sustainable nuclear power.

nuclear energy,"Same format as above: 1a) Obviously wind farms take up much land, but the U.S has excessive land that we do not use mostly in the desert where there are plenty of wind. http://hubpages.com... Solar power plants work 24/7 even in cloudy conditions. http://www.grist.org... Building a nuclear power plant cost at least $4 billion, it is more costly to the 130 million for wind turbines that can be decommissioned or moved around. At least there methods do not deplete any resources, unlike nuclear. 1b) A serious nuclear accident would involved deaths and a major change in the surrounding enviroment. There is a 16% chance of a nuclear disaster within the next 40 years. (http://docs.google.com...) Space shuttles like Discovery were expected to have an accident every 76 flights. Instead, in less than 24 flights there were 2 accidents. Considering the fact nuclear power plants are built near cities, chances are nuclear accidents will cause devastating damage to the city. The majority of the cost of the accident will come from taxpayers. Other accidents:(http://www.lutins.org...) 2) Pro agrees because there were no arguments there. 3) Recycling is more expensive than obtaining newly mined uranium. So obviously nuclear companies would mine new sources and enrich nuclear. Metal is recycled more efficiently and economically cheaper than uranium. Not only that but wind turbines can be moved, unlike nuclear power plants. ""Reprocessing doesn't make any sense – economically, it's more expensive"" than mining uranium and just discarding the waste, claims Steve Caldwell, Policy Coordinator for the Pew Center on Global Climate Change. http://news.cnet.com... 4) Dave ignored the fact that the U.S has excess deserted land that can be filled with wind turbines, solar panels, and solar power plants. Con's case: 1) Over $96 billion per site. Considering we have many that also has to be maintained over tens of thousands of years and with inflation, so that's over $96 billion. http://www.usatoday.com... 2) Decommissioning a power plant just stripping the nuclear substance cost $320 million per unit. Compare this cost to simply moving solar panels or wind turbines by flatbed trucks. 3) Read my R2 and R3 sources. There were smuggling attempts while transporting uranium. In Russia in 1999 plant workers tried to sell 5 grams of radioactive material to the open market. Several years before some others were caught selling 4.5 kilograms of enriched uranium. http://www.atomicarchive.com... 4) One, ""The European Commission said in 2001 that at the current level of uranium consumption, known uranium resources would last 42 years. When added to military and secondary sources, the resources could be stretched to 72 years. Yet this rate of usage assumes that nuclear power continues to provide only a fraction of the world's energy supply. If electric capacity were increased six-fold, then the 72-year supply would last just 12 years."" Two, recycling is currently under experiments and very expensive. Plutonium 239 is a highly unstable byproduct of recycling and also increases the risk of an accident. I'm surprised that none had sunk yet; if one did it will contaminate the ocean, like oil. Actually, there was a solution about sinking waste but any rupture, even from one canister, would cause serious major environmental damage. So with that said nuclear energy should not be the primary alternative energy. Voting issues: 1) Davewerty dropped my 2nd rebuttal on his case about high security standards not being able to protect the environment. 2) Davewerty did not have valid sources backing is arguments. Note to Davewerty: always post sources. 3) Nuclear accidents are likely to happen/increase if we increase our use, proven above. 4) In the long run nuclear energy are more expensive than any other alternative sources. 5) U.S has excess desert land that no one live on and are promising to solar and wind power, we should invest more in those instead, basically went in a circle about how alternative energy takes up land and money. 6) Nuclear recycling is currently unstable and expensive so it is not as economical and eco-friendly as other alternatives. 7) Nuclear waste is still a major issue, recycling is not a reliable option. 8) Increase in nuclear energy would increase the chances of smuggling nuclear for ""other purposes.""

nuclear energy,"I would like to begin my final round by congratulating Pro on a lively and challenging debate. I'm particularly glad that we were able to avoid getting bogged down by semantics, disputed definitions and the like and have a robust discussion about the pros and cons of nuclear energy. A number of matters have been considered, but essentially most of the disagreement has been concerning two issues - whether nuclear power is financially viable, and whether it is safe. If the answer to these questions is yes, Pro has made his case. If the answer is no, then we have to conclude that atomic power is not beneficial. Is nuclear power financially viable? Pro has provided several graphs which look quite impressive, yet fail to tell the true story. The LCOE figures presented in round two appear to show nuclear power in a favorable light compared to all other sources, and yet as I have pointed out, there is no indication that they take into account the massive subsidies and post-production costs which falsely lower the apparent cost per unit of production. The two graphs Pro presents in round four do claim to include startup costs, however the very significant costs associated with decommissioning of the reactor at the end of its life do not appear to be factored into the equation. In round 4, Pro quotes Ellen Vancko of the Union of Concerned Scientists in support of his case. Unfortunately, the source of the quote is not given, and I am unable to match the quoted text using Google search. But there is no worse source that Pro could possibly quote on the subject. Ellen Vancko and her organization have published some of the most detailed and scathing criticisms of the financial viability of nuclear power to be found anywhere. I will finish my critique of Pro's arguments on this topic by reproducing a little of what a press report which announced the release of their 146 page study of the topic has to say on the subject: ""...subsidies have supported every stage of the nuclear fuel cycle from uranium mining to long-term waste storage. Added together, these subsidies often have exceeded the average market price of the power produced."" It goes on to say ""The cost of this technology continues to escalate despite billions in subsidies to both existing and proposed plants. Instead of committing billions in new subsidies that would further distort the market in favor of nuclear power, we should focus on more cost-effective energy sources that will reduce carbon emissions more quickly and with less risk"".[1] Is nuclear power safe? In round four, Pro makes the statement ""I'm not sure why my opponent keeps arguing about the deadly risks of nuclear power when I've pointed out several times it's [sic] safety record"". The reason I keep arguing about it is because the safety record Pro is suggesting is a fabrication of atomic energy interests, and pro appears to have swallowed it hook, line and sinker. Let's look at Pro's claims one by one: * Three Mile Island was ""fully contained"" This was indeed the official line from the power plant operators and the early studies. But ""A new analysis of health statistics in the region conducted by the Radiation and Public Health Project has, however, found that death rates for infants, children, and the elderly soared in the first two years after the Three Mile Island accident in Dauphin and surrounding counties.""[2] How could this be? Well, this same article also reports disturbing events well away from the supposedly ""contained"" disaster area, including: ""Jean Trimmer, a farmer who lived in Lisburn, Pa. about 10 miles west of TMI. On the evening of March 30, 1979, Trimmer stepped outside on her front porch to fetch her cat when she was hit with a blast of heat and rain. Soon after, her skin became red and itchy as if badly sunburned, a condition known as erythema. About three weeks later, her hair turned white and began falling out. Not long after, she reported, her left kidney ""just dried up and disappeared"" -- an occurrence so strange that her case was presented to a symposium of doctors at the nearby Hershey Medical Center. All of those symptoms are consistent with high-dose radiation exposure.""[3] This and many other experiences have become the subjects of more than one book. * Fukushima resulted in no deaths This is perhaps the most brazen lie of all to come out of pro-nuclear groups. It has been observed that ""lower levels of radioactivity take time to result in cancer and other illnesses - that there is a 5 to 40 year 'incubation period'""[4]. It is not yet four years since the Fukushima disaster, so the worst is still to come. Quoting the same article, here are a few more estimates and observations: Dr. Chris Busby, scientific secretary of the European Committee on Radiation Risk predicts ""a death toll of more than a million"". Arnie Gundersen, a former nuclear industry senior vice president, has said: ""The health impacts to the Japanese will begin to be felt in several years and out to 30 or 40 years from cancers. And I believe we're going to see as many as a million cancers over the next 30 years because of the Fukushima incident in Japan."" Dr. Helen Caldicott, a founder of Physicians for Social Responsibility, is also quoted: ""The accident is enormous in its medical implications. It will induce an epidemic of cancer as people inhale the radioactive elements, eat radioactive vegetables, rice and meat, and drink radioactive milk and teas. As radiation from ocean contamination bio-accumulates up the food chain ... radioactive fish will be caught thousands of miles from Japanese shores. As they are consumed, they will continue the the cycle of contamination, proving that no matter where you are, all major nuclear accidents become local."" * Chernobyl was the result of major design deficiencies and bad safety measures Chernobyl's meltdown occurred in 1986. Fukushima was 25 years later, in 2011, just three and a half years ago. This demonstrates that in spite of the supposed vast improvements that have been made, disastrous failures still can occur, threatening hundreds of thousands to millions of lives with each event. The supposed safety record of the nuclear industry is based on denials and cover-ups, not on fact. Concluding remarks: Pro has made several references to the cost and safety of nuclear power compared to old technologies such as fossil fuels. There is little point in debating any of this, as we appear to be in agreement that fossil fuels should be a thing of the past. The choice, then, comes down to nuclear energy or renewables, such as wind and solar. Of these, not only has nuclear only survived for over fifty years because of massive subsidies and ignoring hundreds of billions of dollars in costs due to accidents, but the costs of production are continually rising, and the demands on the public to subsidize these facilities are becoming intolerable. In contrast, the cost of solar PV has plummeted over a 30 year period ""from $22 dollars in 1980 down to under $3 today"" [5] (2010 figure). According to the same source, ""battery prices are dropping exponentially too"". With far less propping up from the public purse than nuclear has received for decades, renewable energy technologies such wind and solar power can become cheaper than both fossil fuels and nuclear. And they can achieve it with minimal scarring of the landscape, and without leaving a radioactive legacy that will last long after humans no longer inhabit the planet. As I have referred to before, countries across Europe are turning away from dirty, dangerous nuclear energy - it is just not worth the risk to our planet or our people. Nuclear energy is not beneficial. References: [1] http://www.ucsusa.org... [2] http://pittsburgh.about.com... [3] http://www.southernstudies.org... [4] http://www.theecologist.org...

nuclear energy,"While nuclear power it is often proclaimed as clean this does not mean it is a renewable resource like wind, wave, or solar power. Nuclear power plants use uranium to produce energy, which, of course, needs to be mined. Currently only 2.3% of uranium used in reactors in EU is mined in the EU[1]. Moreover, the world’s main uranium deposits are located outside the EU. The use of nuclear energy thus undermines energy self-sufficiency of the EU. This may pose a serious threat to the future. Natural (and other) resources are usually used as the first intermediates of diplomatic disputes. When a country wants to exert diplomatic pressure on another country (or bloc of countries like EU), trade bans or embargos are widely used. For example in 2009 Russia stopped gas supply to Ukraine due to trade dispute between their two national gas companies. Therefore, the supply of uranium may be susceptible to diplomatic and trade relations (which are often volatile) and consequently nuclear power may not be reliable. Is it one of the aims of the EU to become less dependent on imported material needed for energy production.[2] As a non renewable resource we also need to think about the possibility of supplies running out. The concept of ‘peak uranium’ is sometimes overblown but there is only a 230 years supply of uranium at current consumption rates. If the price gets high enough then there are other options for production, including from seawater, but this would clearly mean a big increase in cost and concerns that producers will try to keep cheaper uranium to themselves and export for much higher prices.[3] Thus over longer term the nuclear energy may become far more expensive, or even unavailable due to lack of fuel.

nuclear energy,"My thanks to Pro for his invitation to debate this topic. In keeping with the rules stipulated in round one, I will not be addressing any of my opponent's arguments in this round; instead I will focus on why nuclear energy is not beneficial to society. There are three major problems with the production of electricity in nuclear fission reactors: it is dirty, it is dangerous, and it is expensive. Dirty According to Physicians for Social Responsibility, in the US alone ""Each year, enormous quantities of radioactive waste are created during the nuclear fuel process, including 2,000 metric tons of high-level radioactive waste"". In addition, ""More than 58,000 metric tons of highly radioactive spent fuel already has accumulated at reactor sites around the U.S. for which there currently is no permanent repository."" They go on to point out that ""The production of 1,000 tons of uranium fuel generates approximately 100,000 tons of radioactive tailings and nearly one million gallons of liquid waste containing heavy metals and arsenic in addition to radioactivity.""[1] In addition, the pit mines typical of uranium mining are massively intrusive, involving creating cuts in the earth's surface which can be miles long and up to a mile deep. These mines leave horrible scars on the landscape. They also leave waste in the form of tailings (crushed dust from the radioactive ore), which have a half life of about 80,000 years. What this means is that if we travel as far into the future as the total time humans have inhabited the earth, around half of the radioactivity which the wind has blown across the landscape and vegetation and into our waterways will still be there. As Gordon Edwards describes it: ""as the tailings are sitting there on the surface, they are continually generating radon gas. Radon is about eight times heavier than air, so it stays close to the ground. It'll travel 1,000 miles in just a few days in a light breeze. And as it drifts along, it deposits on the vegetation below the radon daughters, which are the radioactive by products that I told you about, including polonium. So that you actually get radon daughters in animals, fish and plants thousands of miles away from where the uranium mining is done. It's a mechanism for pumping radioactivity into the environment for millennia to come"". [2] Dangerous Mining the raw materials used to power nuclear reactors is dangerous in itself. Firstly, to the miners. ""The most serious health hazard associated with uranium mining is lung cancer due to inhaling uranium decay products.....Many Native Americans have died of lung cancers linked to their work in uranium mines. Others continue to suffer the effects of land and water contamination due to seepage and spills from tailings piles."" [3] Of course, lung cancer is not the only side effect of radiation produced during the mining process. Edwards also refers to ""two categories of human illness that everyone agrees can be caused by exposure to atomic radiation even at very low levels. They are (1) cancers of all kinds, and also (2) genetic mutations -- which can be caused right down to the lowest levels of radiation exposure."" Finally, he adds ""It has now been confirmed by the scientific community -- only in recent years, by the way -- that mental retardation is caused by radiation exposure in the womb.""[2] Besides the mine workers, these symptoms most commonly appear in indigenous populations worldwide, as a great many uranium mines are located in remote areas, on native lands. When most of us think of the dangers involved in nuclear power, we think of nuclear reactors. And when things go wrong with a nuclear reactor, the consequences can be mind boggling. Consider the ""fallout"" of the 1986 Chernobyl disaster: ""An estimated 220,000 people were displaced from their homes, and the radioactive fallout from the accident made 4,440 square kilometers of agricultural land and 6,820 square kilometers of forests in Belarus and Ukraine unusable. It is extremely difficult to get accurate information about the health effects from Chernobyl. Government agencies in Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus estimate that about 25,000 of the 600,000 involved in fire-fighting and clean up operations have died so far because of radiation exposure from the accident.(4) According to an April 2006 report commissioned by the European Greens for the European Parliament, there will be an additional 30,000 to 60,000 fatal cancer deaths worldwide from the accident."" [1] Furthermore, ""To this day, the sheep in Wales are unsuitable for human consumption because of contamination by one particular by-product of the Chernobyl accident called cesium-137."" [2] Nuclear reactor accidents are not as rare as some may believe. ""Globally, there have been at least 99 (civilian and military) recorded nuclear power plant accidents from 1952 to 2009 (defined as incidents that either resulted in the loss of human life or more than US$50,000 of property damage, the amount the US federal government uses to define nuclear energy accidents that must be reported), totaling US$20.5 billion in property damages."" [4] The worst of these have been Chernobyl, Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania, and Fukushima in Japan. I may elaborate with details of the latter two further on in the debate. Whilst not as catastrophic as Chernobyl, there have been serious consequences from both of these incidents. Finally, there is the issue of terrorism. The following report was filed only one week ago: ""Hamas terrorists launched three powerful rockets at an Israeli nuclear power plant on Wednesday "" a terrifying escalation of hostilities in the increasingly violent conflict...Extremists from Hamas"" fanatical Qassam Brigades boasted that they had launched the long-range, M-75 rockets from the Gaza Strip to the Israeli city of Dimona hoping to damage or destroy the reactor, about 47 miles away."" [5] Two of the rockets missed their target, another was shot down; but the consequences of a rocket destroying a nuclear reactor are almost unimaginable. Expensive It is a myth that nuclear power is cheap. For a start, there is the cost when something goes wrong. ""As of October 2012, approximately ""9.4bn (1,335 bn yen) had been paid out in compensation as a result of the Fukushima accident and this is expected to double in the next year. At this stage the final cost can only be roughly estimated, but the utility company, Tepco, has suggested that cost for compensation and decontamination maybe in the order of ""70bn"" [6] The costs of the Chernobyl nuclear accident can only be calculated with a high degree of estimation.... the magnitude of the impact is clear from a variety of government estimates from the 1990s, which put the cost of the accident, over two decades, at hundreds of billions of dollars.[7] But even ignoring the costs incurred by the failure of nuclear reactors, the cost of production is higher than would appear. In the UK ""A pro-nuclear energy group is pressing the government to halt plans to order new atomic power plants because costs have been inflated leaving householders and businesses facing an enormous bill.""[8] Whilst in the US, ""The first generation of nuclear power plants proved so costly to build that half of them were abandoned during construction. Those that were completed saw huge cost overruns, which were passed on to utility customers in the form of rate increases. By 1985, Forbes had labeled U.S. nuclear power ""the largest managerial disaster in business history."" The industry has failed to prove that things will be different this time around: soaring, uncertain costs continue to plague nuclear power in the 21st century. Between 2002 and 2008, for example, cost estimates for new nuclear plant construction rose from between $2 billion and $4 billion per unit to $9 billion per unit"" [9]. Conclusion Throughout Europe, nuclear energy is being abandoned. ""Sweden (1980) was the first country to begin a phase-out (influenced by the Three Mile Island accident), followed by Italy (1987), Belgium (1999), and Germany (2000). Austria and Spain have enacted laws to cease construction on new nuclear power stations. Several other European countries have debated phase-outs.""[10] Nuclear energy is not safe, not renewable, not sustainable, and not affordable. Nuclear energy is not beneficial.

nuclear energy,"Debate accepted. As Pro hasn't specified whether round one is for acceptance or not, I will proceed straight to my opening argument: C1.] Environmental Effects The most obvious issue here is the negative impact that nuclear has on the environment. Pro asserts that ""every technology has problems, air pollution, oil spills etc"" but none have been as problematic as nuclear. I'd also point out that one of their primary causes of air pollution is nuclear itself. The radioactive waste from nuclear can be extremely hazardous to the environment and can additionally be used to create nuclear weapons [1.] http://www.conserve-energy-future.com... and [2.] http://content.time.com... Nuclear bombs naturally pose huge dangers to the environment [3.] http://www.theguardian.com... C2.] Health and Safety Once again, this is a large problem with the production of nuclear. The Chernobyl disaster that Pro refers to is a prime example of how drastically nuclear can go wrong and how severely it can effect people. An estimated 220,000 people were displaced from their homes, and the accident made 4,440 square kilometers of agricultural land and 6,820 square kilometers of forests in Belarus and Ukraine simply unusable. [4.] http://www.psr.org... Accidents and waste caused by the nuclear has hugely contributed to cancer-related deaths, and if a big nuclear fallout was to occur the deaths caused by cancer alone could potentially be in the millions [5.] http://umich.edu... C3.] High Cost of Nuclear It should also come as no surprise that the cost of nuclear is significantly high--both in terms of establishing nuclear power plans and producing the nuclear itself. On average it takes around 5-10 years to construct the plants, and there is almost always vocal opposition from people living directly in the area. [see link one.] Additionally a 2009 UCS report estimated that taxpayers could pay anywhere from $360 billion to $1.6 trillion if current proposals for nuclear expansion were realized. [6.] http://www.ucsusa.org... Thus showing again how incredibly expensive it actually is. As it already stands nuclear energy costs a lot, but the expansion of it [assuming Pro is also arguing for worldwide expansion] would cost literally billions. And the costs of damage to the environment and the considerably negative health effects on people significantly outweigh any ""benefits"". Regarding what nuclear can do to people, one can also take the example of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings in which approximately 200,000 mostly innocent civilians were killed. It wasn't just the case that people were immediately wiped off the earth, rather there was prolonged and widespread suffering as a result of the nuclear. This provides another piece of evidence in the damage that nuclear can cause, and expanding on what we already have more or less equates making it more accessible and increasing the possibility of such events happening again. Rather than building on the nuclear energy that we have, we should be looking at improving standards and ensuring it is used as safely and responsibly as possible. To reiterate once more, these costs enter the billions for each power plan and nuclear building activity [7.] http://www.smh.com.au... In the U.K alone the cost of actually clearing up the nuclear waste has reached a huge 47.9 billion [8.] http://www.dailymail.co.uk... So again, if we were to develop the nuclear energy that we already have and build more power stations; the financial cost would substantially increase.",CON,High Cost of Nuclear It should also come as no surprise that the cost of nuclear is significantly high--both in terms of establishing nuclear power plans and producing the nuclear itself. ...

nuclear energy,"(575)=evidence 8)= argument. This is just a brief key to make it more legible. I believe that the United States of America should increase the nuclear energy production for the following reasons. It has worked in other countries, It is not nearly as deadly as people say, America needs the energy and this is a cost efficient option. 1) For my first argument I would like to point to France. They are getting 77.7 of their energy from nuclear energy. (1)France is fine and they are using nuclear energy effectively and have had less negative environmental impacts than oil coal and other fossil fuels. This is something that America can move into as we do have examples and could follow Frances nuclear code as they have not had any huge nuclear problems. 2) The cleanest energy(3)(4) is by far nuclear power. We are not harming the environment and we are losing less lives than if we used different energy sources. 3) Nuclear energy is the most cost efficient energy in the United States. (2)We are at a time where we are in a state of extreme national debt and the cheapest energy option is by far the best. (5) We are importing 45% of our foreign oil and this is costing way more than the nuclear energy. Nuclear energy can fill this gap in energy production. The cheapest energy and the cleanest energy is the obvious choice.(3) Conclusion: Nuclear energy has proved itself by working in France as well as acting as the cheapest and the cleanest energy we have available.

nuclear energy,"I'll try and rebuttal my opponent's arguments as best I can. 1) My opponent claims that nuclear energy more jobs than other sources. I believe this to be very incorrect. For starters, nuclear power plants require professional scientists over blue collar workers, meaning that it's availability for jobs is significantly decreased. As a result, the average plant only employs 400-700 people, with maybe 3500 temporary jobs for constructing the plant itself (http://www.nei.org...). This is pretty low compared to other renewable sources such as solar power plants that offer jobs in the 1000s. 2) My opponent uses the proposed space elevator as a solution to nuclear waste (a thing that he apparently blows off as not a big problem as well). First off, nuclear waste is a huge problem with power plants since they require highly radioactive elements (such as Plutonium) to operate. The subsequent radioactive waste produced often has a high half-life (time it takes to decay to half its self), with the average element taking at least 1000 years (and that's being generous). Storing it is a huge political and environmental problem as even with places such as Yucca Mountain, there is still more waste (and more continuing to be produced) than places to store it. My opponent states that space elevator will solve this dilemma. Let me just say that while the space elevator is a decent solution to the problem, we are still decades away from constructing it. The space elevator is literally an elevator into space. Financing it would be a huge problem in the UN, not to mention the fact that technology to construct it is still out of bounds. The links my opponent provided only clarify that scientists have all the materials, but what is an ingredient w/o a recipe? There is also the fact that this elevator has many problems of its own such as withstanding the conditions of space (I believe metal can only be in space for 10 years before having to be replaced b/c of the cold, but don't quote me on that), adjusting to the Earth's constant rotation, adapting to the sun's heat when close by, and collisions with other space materials among others. Right now, we can't just wait until all these problems are solved. Nuclear waste needs to be dealt with in another, more viable manner. 3) I will concede to my opponent the point on space required. However, the costs of building a nuclear power plant are very expensive as it costs about $8.5 billion to construct (and that's not even taking into account decommising costs) compared to say a solar power plant that costs about $1.65 billion. I eagerly await my opponents response.",CON,This is pretty low compared to other renewable sources such as solar power plants that offer jobs in the 1000s. ...

[Response:] Within 40 years, used fuel has less than one-thousandth of the radioactivity it had when it was removed from the reactor. And it is incorrect to call it waste, because 95 percent of the potential energy is still contained in the used fuel after the first cycle. Now that the United States has removed the ban on recycling used fuel, it will be possible to use that energy and to greatly reduce the amount of waste that needs treatment and disposal. Last month, Japan joined France, Britain and Russia in the nuclear-fuel-recycling business. The United States will not be far behind.""",PRO,"Washington Post. ... The United States will not be far behind.""",548
nuclear energy,"I will makes my comments on your argument by corresponding them with the same template. 1a) I have already made my point on the use of solar and wind. They are more of a small scale energy. One wind turbine cost 1,000,000 dollars. A farm of 100 would cost 130,000,000 dollars. That lot of 100 would not even produce the amount of one nuclear reactor. Industrial solar panels cost 40-80 thousand dollars. Just imagine a farm of them. And again both these energies do not work 24/7 as nuclear plants do. 1b) You need to put things into perspective. What exactly is a serious nuclear accident? Do you mean an accident like Chernobyl or an accident like 3 Mile-Island. If Chernobyl, that accident happened in 1986. The U.S has much more advanced nuclear technology then that of Chernobyl of 1986. Also Chernobyl did not have a containment building, as all modern nuclear plants do. An accident like Chernobyl happening in the U.S today is next to impossible. If you meant a 3 Mile-Island accident, the worst accident in U.S history ,then you are looking at more of a 900 million dollar clean up. Not a 600 billion dollar clean up. Also that accident was in 1979. So, again our technology is much more advanced. The damage done to the surrounding areas of 3 Mile-Island are minimal. Residents that live next to the plant receive more radiation form the sun then the melted reactor. 3) Nuclear is a declared green energy by the government. Steam produced from nuclear plants create green landscapes as it is keeping plants well watered 24/7. The steam has almost no effect on the acceleration of global warming. Recycling of nuclear waste is not practiced by the U.S only. Every other nuclear country recycles nuclear waste and they prove that recycling waste is practical. Yes, mining of uranium is not very friendly to the environment but you must also ask where all the metal to make wind turbines come from. The answer is mines as well. 4) Previously answered Your case 1) What could the cost of letting a canister full of waste sit in a designated area be? The maintenance is not expensive. Also if Jimmy Carter did not make recycling of nuclear waste illegal the amount of waste would be significantly lower, which would ultimately lower the maintenance cost. 2) Nuclear plants last up to 50-65 years. And almost all plants are not dismantled. They are stripped of nuclear substances and are left to crumble. 3) Obviously you have not seen security at a nuclear plant. I can guarantee that there are no terrorists stealing nuclear waste from secured canisters or diving into the fuel pool to steal waste from fuel rods. Let me know when terrorists in the middle east can send a rocket 5000 miles across the earth and hit a containment building precisely. 4) One, those numbers are wrong. We are looking at a 240 year supply. Two, like a said recycling nuclear waste would increase those years significantly. I have one last thing to say. The U.S Navy has been using nuclear power for decades and have not encountered one problem.",PRO,The U.S has much more advanced nuclear technology then that of Chernobyl of 1986. ...

Donald Trump covers himself by saying that he was a businessman and as such, he gave money to a lot of different causes and people, that was the way business was done. Isn't the reason that Donald Trump is gaining so much support is because the conservatives and republicans in general are becoming fed up with the way the ""Good old boys, ""/ Establishment republicans, and establishment democrats, have been doing business as usual in Washington. Maybe though the Conservative republicans think that those who have been elected to office weren't listening to conservatives and independents and haven't been for a long time and are now willing to take a chance that Donald Trump will listen to them and will promote the things that conservatives believed in.

These claims are undeniably true. However, they're also illogical. When Donald Trump said that Muslims are terrorists and Mexicans are rapists, it was easy to feel that he was racist and anti-Islam. This is absolutely untrue. Donald Trump said during a rally ""I have many Muslim friends who approve of what I'm doing."" Donald Trump Is not anti-Islam. We all know that not all Muslims are terrorists. However, it is important to note that most terrorists are (or claim to be) Muslim! Islam is a peaceful religion, but why is it that it is the ONLY religion that is twisted into such a cult of death? Why is it that whenever Muslims are around a people of another religion, conflict occurs? It's also common knowledge that Illegal Mexicans in the US rape. That's an undeniable fact, but I'll get back to this issue later. You also mentioned that Donald Trump criticizes people. He criticizes people. He's in the Presidential race. Isn't it a given that Donald Trump should criticize people? Finally, you mentioned that Donald Trump would deport the Illegal Mexican immigrants. What's wrong with that? Isn't that a thing that a president (or a person running for president) should do? Think of it this way: We have a picket-fence at the border. People wanting to cross that fence will just jump over it. Most of the time, those people are not coming to escape oppression, though there are a few that genuinely are. The majority of those people will bring in drugs, or rape, or get government benifits for free (a.k.a. Bankrupting our economy). We get the drugs, rape and bad economy, and they get the cash. That's not a good deal. Before I go on to the pros of Donald Trump, I would like to debunk a few Donald Trump myths. 1-Donald Trump is anti-immigration. He is not. In fact, the one strongest argument for this claim is also the same as the one used for the other side. I'm speaking of the wall. The wall that Mexico will pay for. Donald Trump is not anti-immigration. The point of the wall isn't to show the world that the US doesn't want people coming into it; rather, it is a statement that coming in legally will be EASIER than coming in the other way. Donald Trump Himself said ""We'll build the wall, but it will have huge, beautiful door."" Thus, the claim that Donald Trump is anti-immigration does not have any supporting evidence. 2-Donald Trump is a liar because he supported many of the people he now opposes while he was a businessman. The fact that Donald Trump was a businessman meant that he had to be friends with people with power, whether or not he agreed with them politically. Now that Donald Trump is running for president, his priorities have changed monumentally. His goal now isn't to make money, but to better the lives of the American People Now that the myths are out of the way, I'd like to outline why I think Donald Trump would be a good president. 1-He speaks his mind. Ironically, this is the reason that many people dislike him. However, the fact that he isn't afraid to speak his mind is a sign that when he becomes the Pres., he won't change his mind. 2-He knows how to make good deals. He spent his life making good deals for him. Just look around. Look at all the buildings with the name ""Trump""- Trump Tower, Trump Palace, etc. There's no reason to suspect that he would suddenly become bad at getting his way when faced with leaders of foreign countries. 3-He's good with money. Much of my evidence in the previous point applies to this. Donald Trump knows how to deal with money. He spent his life proving that!

And, Donald Trump is both racist and sexist. He thinks all Mexicans are rapists, is a friend of Ku Klux Klan, and called women fat, pigs, dogs, slobs, disgusting animals, and so on. In 2007, he compared women to architecture. He also called all women gold-diggers. He made many more sexist and insulting comments to women, and also many racist comments about Mexicans.

Kratocratic- government by those who are strong enough to seize power through force or cunning. Arguments Donald Trump wishes to achieve great power- One of the objectives of the Sith is to overthrow the weak, take its place, and rule with absolute unobstruction. Donald Trump, as everyone is aware of, is running for president of the United States- the highest position of power in the government. Donald Trump has taken many jabs at our current leadership, as well as other weaker candidates such as Lindsey Graham and Rick Perry. He is attempting to tear down the weaker candidates and take the position of ultimate power. Donald Trump hates Mexicans- Donald Trump's criticism of Mexico and their immigrants have been the source of much controversy. Sith lords despise their enemy, the Jedi. The Jedi are wielders of the light side of the Force. They are peaceful and pacifist. Donald Trump's asinine claims about Mexican criminals being ""rapists"" and ""murderers"" are akin to the Sith's attempts to criminalize the Jedi near the fall of the Old Republic.

donald trump,"In full, My opinion: Donald Trump is not a racist. Before addressing your points I'd like to ""develop"" an understanding: Where do we draw the line on an accusation and allegation? Especially when labeling one as a racist, A word that carries weight when factually and undeniably proved. Simplified I believe an accusation or allegation needs in my opinion substance, Credibility, And truthful intent. When an accusation or allegation is lacking and/ or is dis-aligned within these things it loses its ability to hold or grasp at a factual status. I would like to hear your opinion on this as it will apply to this debate. 1. This is a line from John R. O'Donnell's book, ""Trumped! "" This is not a direct quote. In fact, All of O'Donnell's book is simply a recollection of what he thinks Trump said. 2. The whole narrative of this quote was to shed light on the atrocities ILLEGAL immigrants have been committing. I'm going to assume for respect's sake that you didn't twist this quote intentionally. In your point you write, ""They're rapists"" when the real quote is, ""Their rapists. "" If he really meant to label all Mexicans then he wouldn't have said, ""and some I assume are good people. "" Which came right after where you left off his quote. 3. The Trump Organization, Fred Trump, And Donald Trump were sued. While reading your points it seems that convenient context is being removed from these situations to paint Donald Trump a racist. I'd like to point out that this case was settled with an agreement to give a group of civil-right's activists priority in housing with Trump Management emphasizing no admission of guilt. I'd also like to point out that all forty-three of the African-Americans accusers of the Trump Organization didn't hold Donald Trump at any fault. Lastly, No evidence was uncovered that Donald Trump created or carried out discriminatory policies. 4. I cannot find anything on the Trump Organization, Fred Trump, Or Donald Trump being sued in 1976 for refusing to rent to people of color. A further explanation of this point would be helpful. 5. I fail to see why this is a point in your argument. Donald Trump spent $85, 000 rolling out an ad campaign calling for the death penalty of these teenagers while firmly believing they were the perpetrators. The police through coercion convinced the teenagers to confess to this crime. Thing is, Unbeknownst to the coercion Donald Trump made this decision; moreover, I personally don't agree with his stance on this issue (even though I can see why he holds this view) but in no way is his view and stance on this issue racist. In no light can one find Donald Trump making this case into anything racial. 6. Absolutely not. Yes, Donald Trump still believes the five are guilty for the rape but he has not in any way shape or form connected race into his stance. Saying he believes they are guilty due to their color is downright outrageous and unfounded. 7. We encounter my issue with accusations and allegations. I find this point lacking substance. Simply put, All the substance of this allegation is a former employee alleging that blacks were ordered off the floor when Trump and Ivana came in. That's it. There is no evidence of this happening nor others speaking out on its behalf that I can find. I couldn't find Trump addressing this allegation anywhere either. 8. Once again cannot find anything on this. Please explain and present detailed evidence of these situations. 9. I'm assuming your point is talking about the CNN State of Union show. Donald Trump after being asked to disavow David Duke responded by saying, ""Well, Just so you understand, I don""t know anything about David Duke, OK? I don""t know anything about what you""re even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists, I know nothing about David Duke. I know nothing about white supremacists. "" He went on to say he needed to do research before he disavows anything or anyone. Thing is, Later during the Republican debates in 2016 Donald Trump DID in fact disavow David Duke and the KKK. 10. Same situation as your first point. If you would like to press these two points more, Then I feel our debate will partly lie in the threshold of authenticity regarding accusations. There is a bit to unpack here.

donald trump,"I would like to thank my opponent for creating this debate. I am against Trump's policies. I accepted this debate, because of the definition that was offered for good. Good- to be desired or approved of, having the qualities required for a particular role I will believe that me and my opponent should stick to this definition throughout the debate. As far as I am concerned, Trump has the qualities of being a president. If the definition of good(benefits and harms) was that, than I would not have accepted this debate. No-one should underestimate Donald Trump's intelligence. General Election Trump: Donald Trump is changing his views for the general election. This tells me that Donald Trump does not truly believe in what he has claimed during the Republican Primary. Lets look at the stances. -Trump has stated that he is look forward to increasing the minimum wage. -Trump has stated that he wants to start taxing hedge fund managers which is a step in the right direction. -Trump has also flirted with the idea of changing his policy towards immigrants and Muslims. -Trump has also stated that America should not be involved in Syria. -Trump does not want to cut Social Security spending. -Trump agrees with Obamacare. -Trump is against the outsourcing of jobs. -Trump is for transgender/gay rights. ---------- This tells me that Donald Trump is not as radical or dumb as people have made him out to be. He is from New York, and has been very liberal for a very long time. One can see in the 1980s to 1990s that he held liberal positions. In this election, we are trying to pick out the which one is the lesser of two evils. We already know where Hilary Clinton stands. We already know that she is a basic right winger economically, and on foreign policy wise. Donald Trump has gone to the left, and there is evidence that suggests he is liberal. ----------------------------------------------- My opponent has claimed in his case that Donald Trump appeared to be anti-establishment. He has also claimed that Trump is doing this because the base likes it. I will go one step further than my opponent. Donald Trump is the establishment. Evidence: Donald Trump has had many encounters with the establishment, and has tried to court them. ----------------------------- Two separate sources close to Trump""s campaign added that his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, reached out to Adelson""s political adviser, Andy Abboud, to set up a face-to-face July meeting in Las Vegas between their bosses. Adelson later backed out. And last month, when POLITICO reported that Adelson was leaning toward supporting the GOP presidential campaign of Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, whose hawkish foreign policy views align closely with Adelson""s, Trump lashed out at the senator and his potential patron. ""Sheldon Adelson is looking to give big dollars to Rubio because he feels he can mold him into his perfect little puppet. I agree!"" Trump tweeted. ------------------------------------------- A similar pattern unfolded with Singer, a politically influential New York hedge fund billionaire who also is an ardent Israel hawk. Back in March, when Trump was still publicly toying with running for president, Kushner reached out to one of Singer""s representatives to try to broker a meeting between the representative and Trump, according to a source familiar with the interaction. Kushner indicated that Trump was laying the groundwork for a campaign and suggested Singer""s representative might want to hear about the plans. But a few days after Singer declared his support for Rubio on Friday, Trump went on the attack. -------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Trump campaign sought access to the political and public policy network helmed by the Koch brothers. Trump""s aides detailed his policy positions for the Kochs and their donors in a survey put together by Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, the group that coordinates the Koch network and hosts its twice-a-year donor gatherings. But when Trump was not among the five candidates invited to the Koch donor gathering in August at which the survey was distributed to donors, he unleashed some serious snark at his rivals who were included R13; Rubio, Walker, Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz and Carly Fiorina. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- All of this evidence supports the fact that Donald Trump is an establishment candidate. He is manipulating his voters. That is basically what a lot of politicians do during elections. Trump has perfected that art, and was able to beat 15 candidates at it. There is also more evidence that further reveals how establishment Donald Trump really is. Paul Manafort is one of Trump's top aides. There has been a tape that has been leaked which proves that Trump is very establishment. In an effort to build a bridge between the GOP establishment and Trump, Manafort calms down GOP worries, and says that Trump is playing a character. He is trying to complete the first phase which was to win the Republican primary. He will re-invent himself after he wins the Republican primary. I will link the video in the sources part of the case. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- Will Trump be a good president? Good-to be desired or approved of, having the qualities required for a particular role President- the elected head of a republican state He does have the qualities of getting the particular role. He has shown that he has been able to manipulate a large group of people, and make them believe that he is something he is not. Millions of people today think that Trump is anti-establishment. That is the exact opposite of what he is. In his book(The Art of the Deal), he says that being in the public eye is always a good thing whether good or bad. Being known helps one stay relevant. He was able to give the media a great story. My opponent agrees that Trump has been able to dominate the media. Trump has proven his intelligence, and his ability to con Americans. But, my opponent could ask how this translates to having the qualities of the president. What are the qualities of a president? One would have to judge what previous presidents have done. The qualities I believe would be to: -Further American interests. -Working with the senate. Trump will likely continue where Obama and Bush left off. Trump is an establishment Republican. He likely holds the same views as establishment Republicans. ------------------------------------------------------------ Now, I have a few questions that I would like my opponent to answer. -How many policies that you have listed in your case do you actually think Donald Trump will pass? -Do you believe that Donald Trump has shown his intelligence throughout his life? -Do you believe that Donald Trump is establishment?

donald trump,"1973 Racial Bias Lawsuit Actually, that's only partially true. Donald Trump himself was not sued, Trump Management Inc. was. At that time, as stated by your source, Trump was only an apprentice - his father, Fred Trump, was in charge. This means that any accusations of racism within the company would be attributed to Fred Trump. The title of your source (a liberal-leaning source, however, I'm completely okay with that) is very misleading and even contradicts information that later appears in the title. ""Inside the government""s racial bias case against Donald Trump""s company, and how he fought it"". Well yes, it's Donald Trump's company today, but in 1973 it was owned by Fred Trump; of course Donald will be loyal and defend his father, and of course he will testify in court for him, but to hold Donald Trump entirely accountable is downright false. A better title would be: ""Inside the government's racial bias case against Fred Trump's company, and how Donald Trump defended his father."" On top of that, you didn't provide any evidence that Trump was aware of any racism in his father's company, considering he was just an apprentice at the time. 2. Obama Birth Certificate I'm not so sure about that. Barack Obama was not the only African-American to run for president while Trump was alive. Shirley Chrisholm ran in 1972 - Trump did not ask for a birth certificate. Jesse Jackson ran in 1984 and 1988 - Trump did not ask for a birth certificate. Lenora Fulani ran in 1988 and 1992 - Trump did not ask for a birth certificate. Alan Keyes ran in 1996 and 2000 - Trump did not ask for a birth certificate. Carol Moseley Braun ran in 2004 - Trump did not ask for a birth certificate. Al Sharpton ran in 2004 - Trump did not ask for a birth certificate. Ben Carson ran in 2016, against Donald Trump himself - Trump did not ask for a birth certificate. The reason Trump was suspicious about the birth certificate was because of Obama's ties to Indonesia and Kenya. I think it's a little absurd, but it's not fueled by 'xenophobia' and 'racism'. 3. Presidential Campaign Controversies You claimed that ""Trump's anti-immigration campaign is [racist["". Actually, Donald Trump is pro-immigration and against only illegal immigration. Even though illegal immigration is a minor crime, it is a crime nonetheless - hence the word 'illegal'. We can't turn a blind eye to it, especially when 3 million arrests have been attributed to an undocumented population of only 11 million - and yes, Trump cites this statistic on his website and links to a source. Saying that he is blindly accusing illegal immigrants of crime is false. 4. Gonzalo Curiel Gonzalo Curiel is part of an society called La Raza Lawyers, which ""promotes the interests of Latino communities throughout the state."" The comment Trump made, as he clarified in the interview featured on your source, referred to this rather than referring solely to his Mexican heritage. The idea that someone will be biased against you if they are part of a group that dislikes you is not extreme at all. In my opinion, Trump's comments were fine and not racist. 5. Muslims You're right, Islam is a religion, not a race. That being said, I'll discuss your argument anyway. First of all, he only wants to have a Muslim database for refugees, not Muslim citizens. It says that very clearly in the Politifact source you used. Secondly, he did not suggest that ""Muslims should have to carry around specials IDs"" in your second source, it only says that he did not rule it out at the time, and by the looks of it, he has ruled it out now. Finally, in your third source, he says that perhaps we should start thinking about profiling Muslims, not that he supports it. In fact, he said he is hesitant about profiling in that same source, though he said we should not yet rule it out. He has not gone any further with it, however. 6. KKK Supports Trump They also endorsed Hillary. William Quigg, a grand dragon in California, pledged his allegiance to her and the Klan donated $20,000 to her campaign. Does that mean we can interpret her policies as racist now? Donald Trump is NOT a racist.

donald trump,"The definitions my opponent uses are vague and unsubstantiated. I propose alternate definitions. Sith Lord: Sith Lord was a title that was conferred on members of various Sith Orders who had both considerable knowledge of and strength in the dark side. (1). With that, it's worth noting that Pro has the Burden of Proof. The one making the positive claim that goes against the status quo (i.e. that Donald Trump is a normal human being) has the burden to substantiate their claims. So before I go through and respond to his individual claims, I'll make a list of the reasons why it's hard to believe that Donald Trump is actually a Sith Lord: 1. Donald Trump has shown no instance, or given any evidence for us to believe, that he can actually use the dark side of the force. As this is a prerequisite to being a Sith, much less a Sith Lord, it's on Pro to give us evidence that he can actually wield the force. 2. There's no evidence to believe that Donald Trump owns a light saber. Possessing a lightsaber is a key attribute of a force-wielder, and it's usually never absent from their person. If he owned one, we would know of it. Therefore, it falls on my opponent to show him possessing and being able to wield a lightsaber. 3. Those seeking to become a Sith Lord, per tradition, had to train and pass the Sith Academy course on Korriban, which consisted of various brutal tests and trials for Sith to overcome.(1) This places a few burdens on my opponent to prove: first, that Korriban exists in the first place, second that Trump has actually visited Korriban to enroll in the Sith Academy, and third that Trump actually successfully completed the Sith Academy and became a Sith Lord. Anything short of this means that Trump cannot be a Sith Lord. With that, let's go to my opponent's claims. ""Donald Trump wishes to achieve great power."" - A few responses to this: 1. So does every other politician. Unless my opponent is claiming that every politician in history was a user of the Dark side of the force, this claim means nothing. 2. This doesn't even mean he's a Sith Lord. By Sith beliefs, this matches literally every single Sith in existence, from the lowely apprentices to the highest ranking Sith Lords and officials. This does nothing to distinguish where in the organization Trump ranks. ""Donald Trump hates Mexicans."" First, reject the assumption that Mexico is the Jedi. Border wars and drug violence seems to indicate that Mexicans are anything BUT peaceful or pacifists. Second, turn this against him as Trump has more dealings with Jedi than he does with Sith. When you hear that the Jedi are peaceful and pacifistic, what country would instantly come to your mind? Mexico, with their drug wars and crime? Or mother-f*cking SWITZERLAND, with absolute neutrality and a hate for conflict and violence? Since Trump for sure has Swiss bank accounts (2), he has more positive interractions with Jedi than my opponent would lead you to believe. This leads us to the conclusion that it's far more feasable for Trump to be a Jedi rather than a Sith. ""Donald Trump wears Sith garments and command a legion of soldiers"" First, that's hardly a legion of soldiers. That's barely more than a platoon. Second, those are hardly Sith garments. That looks like what imabench would wear to a kinky office orgie. As such, there's no reason to believe that Trump is a Sith Lord. Rather the opposite, I'm of the belief that he's a Jedi Knight who deals with peaceful swiss bankers. Sources: [1] - http://starwars.wikia.com...

donald trump,"I would like to bring attention to some factors that I believe were important in Donald Trump's victory, that will likely not be present in the 2020 elections. First, Trump’s opponent, Hillary Clinton, was also very unpopular. For most of the campaign she too was below 50% popularity. This shows in some of the closest states in the 2016 election: Michigan--0.3%, New Hampshire--0.4%, Wisconsin--1%, Pennsylvania--1.2%, and so on. Two unpopular candidates led to very close margins. However, when we look at Trump’s approval rating, for the most part he has gotten less and less popular since winning the Presidency. There’s been a minor uptick in popularity, but he’s had similar short term fluctuations previously. Meanwhile it cannot be assumed that the Democratic challenger will be as unpopular as Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump. So what we are likely to see is that while Donald Trump enters the 2020 election with even lower popularity than in 2016, his opponent will likely enter with higher popularity than Hillary Clinton. With the razor thin margins Trump won by in several states, such a shift could easily give the state to the Democrats. Related is that Hillary Clinton was under a very public investigation throughout the election. That, along with the last minute revelation of the investigation restarting also hurt her chances in the general election. In effect in the 2016 election, Donald Trump was running on easy mode against a candidate that even a majority her own party didn’t like or trust, yet still just barely beat out his opponent in multiple states. Against a more popular and trusted candidate, Donald Trump is highly unlikely to win in 2020. https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com... http://abcnews.go.com... http://abcnews.go.com...",PRO,"I would like to bring attention to some factors that I believe were important in Donald Trump's victory, that will likely not be present in the 2020 elections.  ...

It clearly shows that Pro is once again stealing bits of his or her sources. In addition to such, Pro does not provide any analysis whatsoever. Instead, Pro provides feedback from Trump Supporters to support his or her own argument. By saying ""On Facebook, [Euronews] received roughly 100 comments, of which around 40 were genuinely supportive of the new US President.

donald trump,"While I don't agree with everything Donald Trump stands for, I will partially devils advocate for this debate. I think people who know me will be able to tell the difference betwene when I'm serious and when I'm not here. Here we go: OMG Donald Trump is one of the greatest men to ever live! He's a combination of Ross Perot, Napoleon Bonaparte, and Margaret Thatcher and that's saying a lot. It's important to understand that Trump is a very successful businessman who owns a very large corporation. I believe that the government should be run like a business and Trump is just the man. It's also important to remember that Trump has made mistakes and has experienced bankruptcy once. This, however, is a good thing because he now understand how to avoid bankruptcy in the future. I would take Trump, a man who has experienced bankruptcy over Obama, the ""constitutional law professor"" who could not be more hypocritical and has never experienced work in the market before. Trump has worked in the economy, Obama has not. [1] Three things Trump said he would if he were president: 1. Sue OPEC for violating antitrust laws and use America's resources to create jobs. [2] 2. Cut taxes and reduce government spending in order to bring more economic growth. [2] 3. Repeal Obamacare. Who likes that BS anyway? [2] Finally, just because Trump has held no political office does not mean he should not be elected. I anything he's not part of the problem in Washington. Remember, Dwight Eisenhower never held a political office, but still won as well as Zachary Taylor. Sources 1. https://en.wikipedia.org... 2. Trump, Donald. Time to Get Tough: Making America #1 Again. Washington, D.C.: Regnery Pub., 2011. Print.",PRO,"This, however, is a good thing because he now understand how to avoid bankruptcy in the future. ... [2] Finally, just because Trump has held no political office does not mean he should not be elected.",577
donald trump,"The point is that the Justice Department did an investigation and found discrimination in the Trump business. At best, Donald was covering up the racial discrimination of his father’s company. At worst, he was actively engaged in carrying out the discrimination. Either way, I find him guilty. Whether we call the lawsuit a win or a loss is irrelevant. 2. As I’ve said, the birther movement gave a nod and a wink to peoples’ xenophobic beliefs. We both agree that there doesn’t seem to be a rational reason for its existence. Therefore, the best motivation for the birther movement and for Trump’s involvement seems to be xenophobia and racism. 3. You’re right, I argued that Trump doesn’t want Mexican immigrants, period. It doesn’t matter that removing restrictions would affect all immigrants, if Donald were pro-immigration he would support this. While ‘Mexican’ isn’t a race, there is a lot of overlap between Mexican and Hispanic. Besides, discriminating against an entire nationality can still be considered racist since race is not rigidly defined. I already explained in this debate why I think Donald is not truly concerned with the legality of immigration and that instead he cares more about the race and nationality of the immigrants. You’re last point is correct, I didn’t refute your statistic because I didn’t need to; this is a debate about Trump, not immigration. 4. Donald Trump’s original criticism was: “Everybody says it, but I have a judge who is a hater of Donald Trump, a hater. He’s a hater. His name is Gonzalo Curiel.” Everything he said later was just damage control, although some of this damage control ended up hurting him even more, as I discussed in earlier rounds. The distinction between La Raza Lawyers and the general Hispanic community is arbitrary for the purposes of this debate. 5. For months, Donald said he wanted to ban all Muslims who are not US citizens. He started softening his tone in recent months to pander to the general electorate, but that doesn’t erase his previous statements. I make no comments about a geography-based travel ban, but a religion-based one does not make sense as a practical strategy since one can lie about their religion. This leads me to question the true motivation for the Muslim ban. I didn’t compare the Muslim ban to the Holocaust (reread my original argument from round 3) but I did compare Islamophobia to anti-Semitism. The majority of both Jews and Muslims are innocent. 6. This is a strawman. Racists don’t just happen to support Trump, they are directly inspired by Trump’s policies and statements which I talk about in my first 5 points. In your opening argument, you write “Donald Trump is NOT a racist, despite what how the media portrays him.” My response is that it’s not just the media that perceives Trump as racist. While this argument doesn’t stand alone, it validates my other arguments. It’s clear that Trump has engaged in a pattern of racist and racially biased behavior. I rest my case.

donald trump,"Donald Trump has motivated racism, impulsivness, and an overwhelming stupididity in his voters. His views are not thouroghly explained, and are very idealistic. Donald Trump is the embodiment of the grassroots anti-establishment Republican. He views himself as one of the most intelligent men alive, and has motivated his religious disciples to believe he is the most intelligent man in the world. In this debate, I will be argueing that Donald Trump is idealistic, naive on policy, and has oversimplified many issues. C1-Donald Trump's political views and statements -Ban all Muslims from entering the US First, I will start with the main problems with this. Global community knows that America supports racism and pregiduce against other people Muslims in America will feel alienated resulting in ISIS propaganda becoming more persuasive It is is also extremely unconstitutional Evidence for the global community disliking Trump was shown in the UK. People there created a petition to ban Donald Trump from entering the US. This should be taken into account, because the petition got over 370,000 signatures in the UK, and was actaully debated in Parliament. Muslims will feel alienated in Donald Trump's administration. Evidence usually shows that when Muslims feel left out and discriminated; radical idealogies will become more persuasive. This does not have to do with their religion, and can be applied to any group of people with any religion. Many law professors deem it as unamerican as it is unconsitutional to pursue such a ban. The Federal Government cannot ban any religious group from entering the US. They are free to move to America. The Founding Fathers also specifically state the government has secular. There should be no religous persecution here. Banning Islam will cause the government to promote their own religion. -Donald Trump claims that we have to play ISIS's game Trump basically declared that the federal government should torture people. In other words, he wants to violate international law. I will outline the problems with this stance. Torture is immoral, and only proves that we are more like our enemies Torture seperates the western world from the authoritarian regimes. It shows that we are more humane and civil. Torture violates international law. Torture does not work on religious nuts. Torture is immoral, and I do not see why I should explain myself. We all know that torture is inhumane, and only practiced by the tyrannical. The western world is supposed to be better when it comes to governing human beings. We all want equality under the law. Authoritarian regimes do not care about lives, and are there to keep there own power. The western world is supposed to be enlightnened. The US constitution specifically states in the 8th amendment not to resort to cruel punishment. In 1984, Convention against Torture law was put into place. Donald Trump will not only violate the 8th amendment, but will also violate international law. -Kick out illegal immigrants People do not realize how significant of an impact do illegal immigrants make on the US economy. Amnesty would be ideal in fixing the situation. Not only did Donald Trump stereotype illegal immigrants by calling them rapists, drug dealers, and immoral people, but he also has created a bad name for himself in Latin America. Here are the reasons why Donald Trump came up with another pathetic idea. Illegal immigrants make a significant impact on the US economy. Donald Trump has created a bad name for himself in Latin America which will motivate tensions in America's relations with Latin America. Donald Trump generalizes people which already creates a bad president. Illegal immigrants contribute 11 billion dollars to the economy each year. They actually pay higher taxes than the top 1%. There is no evidence that they are drug dealers and rapists. They account for 8% of the gross domestic product. The Mexican Government has already stated that they are not paying for they are not paying for the wall that Trump wants. The Mexican people are beginning to feel worried. Researchers asked Mexicans what they thought of Donald Trump. One must have an IQ above 95 in order to guess that usually the response is always negative. Trump has created a negative view for himself in that world which will quickly become a negative view of America if he is elected president. Donald Trump generalizes people. Illegal immigrants make up 5% of the worker population. There is no evidence pointing to all of them being drug dealers. This proes that his decision making skills are not only impulsive, but dumb. C2-Donald Trump's supporters I will not do what Donald Trump is amazing at, and generalize his supporters. But, I will give arguments stating how his supporters at his rallies are usually violent and racist. -Ku Klux Klan supports Donald Trump The KKK supports Donald Trump which is already a negative indicator that shows that Trump is motivating racists. KKK leader David Duke already endorced Donald Trump. He claimed that he hoped Trump will do everything he hopes he will do. The frightining part about this is that Donald Trump has not condemned this. He has not said anything against the KKK. He acts like he has never heard of this before. This only motivates racism in America. -Rallies become more and more violent It is already a problemt that his rallies are becoming more and more violent. Here are the unique reasons why it is a problem when Trump is involved. Unintended consequences happen such as people getting injured and beaten. Violence in rallies motivates violence outside his rallies. Trump does not condemn any of this. There are already several frightning cases where Trump's supporters have been violent. There were black people protesting in one of his rallies. They were booed obviously by his supporters, but than things started becoming physical. A Trump supporter started beating up a women. This is unacceptable. There are two alarming cases where a Trump supporter beat up someone of a different skin color. The first case is where a Trump supporter beat up a hispanic man. The Trump supporter was yelling Trum while commiting this crime. There are so many videos on the internet of a Trump supporter beating up a Muslim student. This is simply embarrising for a candidate to have supporters who beat up people of different races. Trump never condemns any of this. He even is proud of the fact that his supporters commit such acts. He even said he will send supporters at Sander's rallies to disrupt them. I believe I have provided reasons why Trump should not become president. In conclusion: Trump has idealistic policies that have so many flaws. He will violate international law as well as the constution. He generalizes people. Racists love him. He promotes violent behavior.

Do you really believe Congress would approve a ban on all Muslims, or building all these walls Trump talks about? Not a chance.

donald trump,"Okay Cosmojarvis take me to court like you said in your ""DM"" but i'm winning this debate The media has been accused of being biased when talking about President Donald Trump and, on many (liberal) people""s Facebook and Twitter feeds, his inauguration was shrouded in negativity. On Wednesday (January 25) we asked Euronews"" viewers why they think (if indeed they do) that Donald Trump will be a great President, in order to identify the motivations of his supporters. With many players in the mainstream media "" including Euronews "" as well as much of the social media conversation having been quick to highlight his contradictions and his more controversial policies, the man who won the 2016 US elections can count on tens of millions of supporters at home and an unquantifiable number abroad. It is their voices we wanted to hear. On Facebook we received roughly 100 comments, of which around 40 were genuinely supportive of the new US President. Slightly more (around 50) comments were negative, with the remaining few showing no apparent preference either way. Among those who told us why they think Donald Trump will be a great President, the most repeated reasons seem to be that: 1. He""s doing what he promised during the campaign 2. He""s not a politician (he""s a businessman, doesn""t belong to the elite"") 3. He will improve relations with Russia 4. He""s not Hillary Clinton The following is one of the most consistent comments: He will create jobs for infrastructure builders. His rule will emphasize the importance US has been playing in the world politics for the last decade (as a different path will be chosen from now on, we will learn the importance of US previous watchdog position regarding world peace and politics). Improving US-RU relations could save the world from next major conflict. He will improve the life for his supporters in the central states (vs coastal). He will show the world that a a lot of traditional christian values are outdated (through enforcement of such values, though). He will show us why the world is worse off, when based on economical values instead of ideals. This could cause a big shift of thought for most of the world and he should get praise for it (which he will most likely not get that much). http://www.euronews.com...",PRO,"He""s doing what he promised during the campaign 2. ... http://www.euronews.com...",584

I think border guards know that."" *This is not villifying Mexicans. It's villifying the Mexican leadership and villifying criminals. www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/us-politics/11759669/Donald-Trump-I-love-Mexican-people.html ----- -Donald Trump has called for barring Muslims from entering the United States, argued for surveillance of mosques and suggested he’d be open to creating a registry of American Muslims. *That's fine by me. He can look look into the Christian churches to make sure they are not threatening national security. If either is plotting to bomb, kill, destroy, mass murder, or conduct ""rape jihad"" I'd like the FBI to get there before it happens. They can survey Atheist churches as well. Doing basic checks on possible extremism is not bigotry. It's common sense. Saying ""death to America!"" Or ""The Americans are infidels who need killed!"" Or ""We want Sharia not democracy!"" From the pulpit is not freedom of speech nor is it freedom of religion. It's a threat to the national security of America. Are all Muslims terrorists? Nope. But because of the nature of the ideology, the percentage of anti-American/anti-West sentiment is greater within this group. That's just badic discernment. Nevertheless, if a Christian preacher or Atheist preacher was conducting anti-American assemblies, behind bars is his proper home. And this is not just my opinion. I am not alone. A recent poll of 2,000 Muslim voters in six states by the Council on American-Islamic Relations found Trump in third place, after Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, with 11 percent saying they would support him. Adam Warshauer 37, Muslim said he would support Trump. Why He’s Voting Trump: Warshauer says he does not believe Trump wants to ban Muslims from entering the country because of a dislike for them, but because he wants to solve terrorism. “”Most are outraged at Trump saying he wants to ban Muslims from entering America, but I support that as a Muslim person, because we have to stop what is happening and work with other Muslim countries to stop terrorism. If you stop Muslims from entering the country, it forces everyone to look at the problem.” Raed Hamdan, 41, Muslim supports Trump. ""Is he reckless with what he says? Yes. Is there a lot of cleaning up to do in the country? Yes. Being a billionaire, I can’t see anyone buying him—paying him off to push him in one direction or another. This guy is reckless but at least you know what’s on his mind."" time.com/4259372/donald-trump-muslim-supporters ----- -Nationalism and war Here is a past article excerpt. -Billionaire Donald Trump, would like to fire the Bush Administration for its decision to invade Iraq, according to an interview in the August edition ""Esquire"". www.rense.com/general54/bushs.htm Being nationalist does not make you Hitler-like. Nationalism definition: 1. spirit or aspirations common to the whole of a nation. 2. devotion and loyalty to one's own country; patriotism. *If someone does not possess these qualities, I don't want them as our President. ----- -Allowing only certain people and behaviors to be acceptable. I'm not certain who ""certain people"" consists of, but some behaviors are not acceptable. If not, we wouldn't have laws or prisons. -Trump renounced the protest in Chicago. Freedom of Assembly is a part of the Bill of Rights. But...it specifically says peaceful assemble and protest. These people became violent, screaming obscenities, and drowning out Trump supporters interviewed after the event was cancelled. I condemn the protest because it was not peaceful assembly. Ironically, we haven't seen Trump supporters do this. But we have seen ""Black Lives Matter"" take over a Bernie Sanders rally and Liberals get violent in mass at a Trump rally.

donald trump,"OK, where do I begin... 1.Trade Many countries object to Donald Trump as president and now that Putin is angry about the bombings that Trump ordered, it will be a lot more difficult for America to close trade deals. 2.

Standard of Living The standard of living probably won't go up anytime soon because of the other factors of Donald Trump's presidency. Donald Trump has had to declare bankruptcy on multiple occasions and he is now in charge of the countries finances which could potentially be a disaster. He is a salesman, not a statesman, and that won't help him in tough times during his presidency. He hasn't had any experience, he hasn't been a politician.

If Russia did in fact influence the election, they could have power over Trump and be able to influence him and subsequently this country He has disrupted the global peace and disrupted Americas connection to the world, putting us the citizens in potential danger.

donald trump,"No, Donald Trump is not a racist, a lot of people believing this is simply cites like CNN, Huffington Post, Buzzfeed, and Daily Mail's clearly biased opinion towards Trump and the fact Hillary didn't win. He is not racist, he is here to help all Americans, in 1990 Donald Trump fought to include Jews and Blacks at Palm Beach Golf Course in 1990's. He's met with multiple popular black figures such as Martin Luther King III, Kanye West, and has multiple black people supporting him, and he's not said anything particularly racist. No, Donald Trump is not sexist, he's hired Women in his office, that's like saying black people in the U.S have oppression after we just had a black President for 8 years. And his ""grab her by the *****."" comment? That's over exaggerated by the media, It's locker talk, and that's clear, if a women said someone similar to that and was filmed saying it would anyone really freak out like all these celebs and women's marchers are? No. It's a joke, don't take it too seriously. Donald Trump also before being President-Elect on his campaign a bit after the Orlando shooting said, ""Only weeks ago, in Orlando Florida, 49 wonderful Americans were savagely murdered by an Islamic terrorist, this time the terrorist targeted the LGBTQ community, no good, and were gonna stop it."" When also being interviewed he stated about gay marriage that the supreme court ruled it and he is fine with and It's not a big issue. It sounds more like he is okay with Americans to choose their sexuality rather than make a big deal about it. Donald Trump is definitely not a xenophobe, he said this ""Many fabulous people come in from Mexico and our country is better for it. But these people are here legally, and are severely hurt by those coming in illegally,"" wrote Trump. ""I am proud to say that I know many hard working Mexicans-many of them are working for and with me""and, just like our country, my organization is better for it."" and what he said here he has clearly shown, legal good people, can come in the U.S and make our country better, but illegal's that cause crime is no good, and you don't want more crime do you? He simply wants the people to come in here legally, nothing wrong with that. He's outright stated he loves China, and the Mexican people. How has he done anything related to white supremacy? That's lunacy, he hasn't shown any signs towards white supremacy, the media and Hollywood elites need to stop making people think these things. And withdrawing from the TPP is a good thing, trust me. Hollywood and the media is ruining people's views on this, trying to obscure them, don't listen to the Hollywood elites, the crazy feminists, they aren't fighting for anything, it may seem like they are but they aren't. Trump is only a week into his Presidency and he's working on doing the things he promised he would, so if the things he said are any indication, Trump is none of these, and It's clear to see.

What is a politician, someone that lies, that says stuff the public wants to hear and they smoothen out the corners. Trump doesn't do that. He is clear and said what he wanted to say.

donald trump,"First of all, I would like to thank the con for opening this debate. I look forward to a fun competitive debate. Before beginning this debate I would like to clarify something. In no point will I be offering my own personal endorsement for any candidate, Democratic or Republican. I will be arguing from an objective stance that Donald Trump is not only qualified for the position of Commander in Chief but he would make a decent president. I would like to begin my opening statement by asking the con to avoid 'ad hominem attacks' [1] on Donald Trump. These attacks include calling him names (sexist, islamophobic, xenophobic, etc) without a) proving that he is in fact the name you call him and b) demonstrating why it matters in his election as president. (For example don't just call him sexist without proving he actually is sexist and showing logically that his sexism would affect his role as Commander in Chief). I, of course, write this intending no offense to the con. It is just that when arguing against a Donald Trump presidency, most people resort to these types of attacks. Now, on to the debate. First of all, Donald Trump understands economics. I feel this to be a fairly obvious fact. Donald Trump has a degree in economics and has been running one of the world most successful companies since 1975. [2] He understand business extremely well and would be good for united states economy. Second. Donald Trump would be extremely vigilant in pursuing national security. First, I'll reference his Muslim ban. Let's understand what this means real quick. It does not mean that no Muslim will ever enter our country ever again. If I understand his proposal well, he is proposing that he put a temporary ban on Muslim travel to the United States ""until our country""s representatives can figure out what is going on."" [3] I take this to mean until we can figure out a good enough vetting process for Muslim immigrants. Regardless of your opinion on the ban, radical Islamic terrorism is a problem in the world. Not every Muslim is a terrorist but every sing radical Islamic terrorist is a Muslim and we need to be cautious. If we don't want another 9-11 or a Paris type situation in America, we need to put peoples feelings aside for a second and focus on national security. While Trump's proposal may seem a little extreme, it would definitely get the job done. Third. I would like to reference Mr. Trump's border proposal. I believe that illegal immigration hurts the United States for two reasons. First of all, workers coming in illegally would not necessarily steal job from US citizens like some would say. They would, however, undercut wages for all workers. Illegal immigrants come over here and will often work for less than the going rate, thereby lowering wages for certain jobs. Secondly, they undermine our immigration system which works pretty well. Our country does not have that complicated of an immigration process. It's simple enough for a person to go through. By coming into our country illegally and being accepted undermines the value of actually following the proper immigration policies. While I don't know if Mr. Trump's wall proposal would necessarily work, he does recognize the need for tighter border control.

donald trump,"Rebuttals ""Donald Trump has shown no instance, or given any evidence for us to believe, that he can actually use the dark side of the force. As this is a prerequisite to being a Sith, much less a Sith Lord, it's on Pro to give us evidence that he can actually wield the force."" Here's the problem with this statement. The sith never displayed their power in a public area. Take Darth Plageuis for example. He, to the common person, was a banker; he never let his true identity become apparent to all but a select few (namely his Jedi adversaries and his apprentice). Darth Sidious is another example. To the public he was known as Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, the benevolent leader of the Republic. His ability to wield the dark side of the Force was never revealed until he attempted to subdue Anakin Skywalker. The sith believe in secrecy and surprise; if the Jedi were aware that someone such as the Supreme Chancellor was a Sith Lord, they would have acted and taken him down. ""There's no evidence to believe that Donald Trump owns a light saber. Possessing a lightsaber is a key attribute of a force-wielder, and it's usually never absent from their person. If he owned one, we would know of it. Therefore, it falls on my opponent to show him possessing and being able to wield a lightsaber."" Not all Sith Lords wielded lightsabers. Darth Sidious in his original appearance never used one, he only used Force lightning. In the Dark Lord Trilogy, he states that ""the Sith had grown beyond the use of a lightsaber and they only continued using them as an insult to the Jedi more than anything else."" ""Those seeking to become a Sith Lord, per tradition, had to train and pass the Sith Academy course on Korriban, which consisted of various brutal tests and trials for Sith to overcome."" The Sith academy on Korriban became a mess of ruins by the time of the Clone Wars, only serving as a tomb for the Sith Lord Darth Bane. Donald Trump would not have had to attend the academy, as he was not even alive when the academy was in existence. Sith lords such as Darth Tenebrous, Plageuis, Maul, Dooku, Sidious, Vader, and more were brought up much after the academy's demise. ""those are hardly Sith garments"" Dark cloaks were the mark of the Sith, and his cloak as shown was inspired by Darth Vader, who had similar pauldrons and a cape. Many Sith however did not adhere to these garments, such as Darth Malak, Darth Sion, or Darth Talon; saying that Donald Trump's attire aren't Sith garments is unjustified. One last thing, Donald Trump DOES posses a lightsaber, as seen here [1] Sources http://i60.tinypic.com...",PRO,"Rebuttals ""Donald Trump has shown no instance, or given any evidence for us to believe, that he can actually use the dark side of the force.

donald trump,"Firstly, Pro, as Lua has pointed out, has simply regurgitated the points of the only source she used, todaysinfo.net, with little to no analysis on the information on the article. I'm not very tolerant of plagiarism, and I am certain that it's against the rules of the website, but for the purpose of the debate, I will continue debating. However, if pro continuously plagarizes entire articles, I may make the decision to stop debating, seeing as I'll only be debating against writers of various articles, rather than Pro. Outline I. Trump's ""Successful"" Businesses II. Trump on Climate Change III. The ""Trump Effect"" IV. Sources I. Trump's ""Successful"" Businesses Any successful businessman can run into trouble from time-to-time, whether it's making a mistake that may hurt his investments, or having suits filed against him. Trump is regarded as one of the most successful businessmen in America. However, his history of businesses and the source of his wealth, only prove that he is incapable of running his own businesses. In fact, an article from ""Business Insider,"" claims that the New York Times analyzed 61 of Trump's projects and deals from the 2000s to 2012. The researchers and analysists found that around 40 of those deals were either failures or had problems which deemed them as fruitless, while only a mere 21 of them were successes. That means that approximately 66% of his deals were unsuccessful (S1). The Business Insider article continues by providing the list of which projects were immediate failures, which ones had problems, and which were successful. His shortcomings in business are also apparent in the 3,500 suits filed against him, ranging from skirmishes with his casino patrons to lawsuits regarding multi-million dollar real estate deals (S2). ""Call it the art of the bad deal, one created by the arrogance and recklessness of a businessman whose main talent is self-promotion."" -Kurt Eichenwald Many people, including myself, believe that Trump's ""success"" was a result of family ties, especially his father's lucrative real-estate business, and his shameless self-promotion, such as that controversy with his ""small hands"" where Trump responded to an article saying he has ""big hands,"" with a gold pen.Kurt Eichenwald, writer of the News Week Article, ""Trump's Many Business Failures, Explained,"" expands upon this idea that ""Trump boasted when he announced his candidacy last year that he had made his money “the old-fashioned way,” but he is no Bill Gates or Michael Bloomberg, self-made billionaires who were mavericks, innovators in their fields. Instead, the Republican nominee’s wealth is Daddy-made. Almost all of his best-known successes are attributable to family ties or money given to him by his father,"" (S3). Donald Trump has tried to run his businesses apart from real estate, though to no avail. Trump, owner of the line of ""Trump Casinos,"" has amassed four bankruptcies. He claims that he had ""nothing to do"" with the failure of the business, despite owning 28% of the stock in the companies. He has also pitched some other business ideas that he put into action. Like his casinos, these ideas failed, terribly. Trump Airlines was a private luxury airline company started in 1988. Due to the lack of profits, the company closed in 1992. Trump also unleashed a brand of his own vodka and steaks called ""Trump Vodka,"" and ""Trump Steaks."" Trump Vodka was made in 2006. The company stopped production in 2011 due to a lack of profit and interest. Trump Steaks began in 2007 but closed down in 2012 for over 51 health code violations, including serving five-month-old duck. That's some ""Trump-quality"" cuisine! Trump attributes the health violations his managers for ""lazily hiring terrible cooks."" The list of Trump's business failures goes on, with things such as Trump the Game, Trump Magazines, Trump University, Trump Mortgage, GoTrump.com, Trump International Tower of Chicago, etc (S4). His inability to manage his own businesses not only proves that he is incapable of administrating his own businesses, he is incapable of building a business empire, he has a lack in priorities for his business affairs, and when all else fails, he searches for a scapegoat. II. Trump on Climate Change Pro claims that Trump will be ""saving billions"" by cutting Environmental Protection, and while that's all well and good for taxpayers, we will still allow climate change to threaten our world. Not only that, but Rex Tillerson, Trump's appointed cabinet member as the Secretary of State, has the authority to remove environmental regulations on businesses, allowing them to dispose of their wastes improperly, contaminating drinking water, killing life in nature and adding to our immense pollution. And the likelihood of Tillerson doing so is high since he is associated with ExxonMobil, a company that provides gas and oil. Cutting environmental regulations on ExxonMobil will mean that they can dump their wastes anywhere. Additionally, if we neglect the environment, then we will run into more health concerns. If water is polluted, then cities, and maybe even states, may have to pay to get clean water. With the threat of global warming, our water supply may be greatly decreased because of the lesser amount of snow pack. And if the air is polluted, then we will need to pay immense amounts to clear the air, though there is not much that can do so. We will run into more health concerns by ignoring the environment, and we may have to pay a large amount for reparations and to buy purified water, which may accumulate for more than the government spending to protect the environment. III. The ""Trump Effect"" Trump's words to not highlight concerns of ""equality"" or ""tolerance."" His talk of banning Muslims from entering the country, and the provocation of violence do not make him the type of person capable of inspiring and bringing America together. I'm certain that no rational person wants to hear their president saying ""‘[Mexicans] are rapists. And some, I assume, are good people,"" or ""I will bomb the s*** out of them!"" (S5). America should have a confident president who can inspire the masses, and point America in the right direction, not an egostatic man who talks of himself so highly, that people are not sure if he's running for President, or for the Guiness World Record for the man with the highest ego in America. The ""Trump Effect"" is the belief that Trump's campaign is making an impression on juviniles and inspiring closeted bigots to unite and fight for their racist beliefs. In a document written by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), the SPLC claims that ""[Trump] is producing an alarming level of fear and anxiety among children of color and inflaming racial and ethnic tensions in the classroom. Many students worry about being deported. Other students have been emboldened by the divisive, often juvenile rhetoric in the campaign. Teachers have noted an increase in bullying, harassment and intimidation of students whose races, religions or nationalities have been the verbal targets of candidates on the campaign trail."" In fact, mroe than two thirds of teacher reported that students, mainly immigrants and Muslims, have expressed concerns about what might happen to their families if Trump is elected president. More than one thirds of teachers reported that they observed an increse in anti-Muslim or anti-immigrant sentiment. A teacher from a middle school with a large population of African-American Muslims said “My students are terrified of Donald Trump. They think that if he’s elected, all black people will get sent back to Africa,” (S6). Donald Trump's campaign and public harassment is clearly making an impact on the populus in the worst ways possible, promoting bigotry and violence and bullying. He, through his words, clearly shows that he is incapable of being a president who can unite the masses. IV. Sources S1) http://www.businessinsider.com... S2) http://www.usatoday.com...
