0	Climate change is a complex issue that is influenced by a variety of factors, both natural and man-made. Although the effects of carbon dioxide emissions may be minimal in the short-term, it is important to consider the potential impacts of increased levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This is especially true given the potential for further increasing temperatures and creating more extreme weather conditions. Therefore, it is essential that we
1	There is a scientific consensus on the reality of anthropogenic climate change. Man-made climate change has already had significant impacts on human health, leading to an estimated 150,000 annual deaths according to the World Health Organisation. Many diseases are linked to climate fluctuations, from cardiovascular mortality to respiratory illnesses due to heatwaves.
2	My position on climate change is that I believe it is caused in part by human activity. While the evidence is not conclusive, I think it is important to take steps to reduce our environmental impact in order to help mitigate the effects of climate change. I recognize that there is disagreement on the subject and believe that it is important to take an
3	There is an overwhelming scientific consensus that climate change is caused primarily by human activities. The effects of climate change can be extremely damaging and costly, especially for children. This can be seen in the form of greater risks of extreme weather events, increased health problems, and decreased access to food and water. As such, efforts to combat climate change need to be taken on a larger scale in order to best protect younger generations.
4	Given the amount of evidence provided by a majority of scientists that points to anthropogenic climate change, it is clear that the phenomenon is real and not a fraud. While it is possible for a small number of scientists to be incorrect, this is an unlikely scenario. Therefore, the consensus among scientists supports the concept of anthropogenic climate change.
5	The climate is changing and this can have a global impact. Although local weather may change, the global climate is still affected, which makes it important to understand and consider. The IPCC is a scientific organization that is composed of many different scientists with different intentions, and it is important to trust them when it comes to understanding climate change. This helps to ensure that accurate information is available and that all parties are well-informed.
6	The official definition of climate change is: a change in global or regional climate patterns that is attributed to human activities. In particular, we have seen a rise in atmospheric CO2 levels since the mid-20th century, due to the burning of fossil fuels. This has led to an increase in global temperatures of about 1°C since 1969. Ocean temperatures have also risen significantly. This provides strong evidence for the link between human activities and climate change.
7	The evidence suggests that climate change is largely caused by human activity, as opposed to natural changes. This suggests that reducing emissions can have a beneficial effect on mitigating climate change. While it is true that the Earth is much larger than humans, the magnitude of the effect is still significant and requires careful consideration. Additionally, it is important to consider the laws of physics and how they can interact with different mass. This can help to better understand the potential effects of climate change.
8	The earth's atmosphere is composed of 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, 0.9% argon, and 0.1% trace gases including carbon dioxide (CO2). According to the IPCC, human activities account for about 800 million tons of CO2 emissions annually. This is roughly 3.62% of the total atmospheric CO2 level, indicating that human activity does play a role in climate change. While natural processes also contribute to climate change, the majority of the cause lies in human activity. This suggests that humans are a key factor in climate change and that policy solutions should be aimed at reducing emissions.
9	The scientific consensus on climate change is that burning of fossil fuels and the resulting release of CO2 is the primary cause. This is supported by evidence from a wide range of studies, which show an increasing level of agreement among experts as more research is done.
10	There are many different types of feminism. The version you disagree with is the one that is widely adopted by the Pink Hat movement. These movements aim to recognize that women have their own unique qualities that should be celebrated, as opposed to comparing themselves to men. This approach highlights the idea that women can have different strengths and abilities than men, which can be utilized to complement each other in order to achieve success.
11	Feminism seeks to enhance the rights, autonomy, and opportunities of women, while also recognizing and accounting for the experiences of different women. It is a movement that advocates for the advancement of gender equality, both actively and passively, in order to achieve better outcomes for women.
12	Con has argued that dictionaries do not authoritatively define words, which is true to an extent as the definition of a word is subject to change depending on its usage. However, dictionaries provide a good starting point for understanding the meaning and usage of a word as they tend to be based on popular usage. In this debate, Con has provided an example of masculinism being defined which supports his argument. Thus, his argument is sound. I have offered six examples of words being defined which
13	Feminism is the belief that men and women should have equal rights and opportunities, which includes advocating for justice in cases of sexual assault. Stating that feminism can lead to false rape accusations is an example of rape culture and is unacceptable. Both men and women should be treated fairly and with respect, and feminists are working towards this goal. It is important to recognize the biases and systemic issues that can lead to unequal outcomes for both genders, rather than simply focusing on one gender.
14	My opponent claims that feminism is an important movement that works towards achieving equality between the sexes. Although I agree that equality does not yet fully exist, feminism will remain necessary until it does as it works to raise awareness and ensure that gender inequality is addressed. Furthermore, feminism will continue to play an important role in maintaining equality once it is achieved. Although success may be possible in some areas, it is important to ensure that gains are sustained and that feminism does not become unnecessary.
15	I agree that feminism is still necessary in some countries where women are subject to discrimination and lack of rights. However, this is less of an issue in first-world countries, such as the US, where democracy and peace are more established. Many of these Middle Eastern countries enforce these laws due to their religious beliefs, which often require women to cover themselves and adhere to certain rules. Thus, feminism is still needed in these areas in order to ensure gender equality.
16	I believe that third wave feminism has made important strides to ensure gender equality. This movement recognizes that societal expectations around gender can be limiting to both men and women and works to address this. I believe this shift in feminism is important and has made a lasting impact.
17	I believe that gender equality is an issue that should be addressed by both men and women. While feminism focuses on issues that specifically impact women, men can also be advocates for male-related issues. For example, prostate cancer affects men at the same rate as breast cancer and deserves equal levels of research and funding. Furthermore, Men’s Rights Activists also play an important role in this advocacy.   It is true that feminism is not the sole movement working towards equality for all genders; however, it is equally important that men join in the fight in order to achieve true gender equality.
18	Pro acknowledged that feminism is beneficial as it advocates for equal rights, which is the same as saying that feminism is beneficial overall. Therefore, although the term “feminism” may have a negative connotation for some, it is still an important movement as it works towards creating equal opportunities for both genders.
19	Feminism today can be very complex and is often inconsistent, making it important to consider the needs of both men and women equally. I believe that rights should be offered to both genders, rather than favouring one or the other. This ensures that everyone is given fair treatment and the chance to be heard.
20	Abortion is the deliberate termination of a human pregnancy, which is a complex and emotional decision for a woman to make. Around 42 million women in the world choose abortion as an option to manage their pregnancies, making it an extremely common choice. While abortion can be a safe and legal option in some cases, it is important to understand the risks and benefits of the procedure in order to make an informed decision. Laws surrounding abortion vary by region, but it is important to understand the legal protections available in order to ensure a woman’s right to choose. Finally, it is important to remember that fetuses
21	Abortion is the premature expulsion of a fetus and its accompanying membranes and placenta from the uterus. I am personally against many forms of abortion due to the risk of health complications. It is important to have safe and legal abortion procedures, as the risk of serious complications from unsafe procedures can be high. Coat hangers and other invasive techniques can increase the risk of infection and other complications, and should be avoided as they can be life-threatening.  It is best to use safe and effective methods that provide the highest level of safety for the mother.
22	Abortion is the deliberate termination of a pregnancy, either by medical or surgical means, prior to the fetus being able to survive outside of the womb. This decision is usually made to ensure the health of the mother and is a highly personal decision that should be left to the woman and her healthcare provider to decide.
23	Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by the removal or expulsion from the uterus of a fetus or embryo, which can either occur spontaneously due to complications during pregnancy or can be induced, in humans and other species. In the context of human pregnancies, an abortion can be performed for a variety of reasons, including to preserve the health of the mother, to terminate an unintended pregnancy, or for other medical or social reasons. While abortion is a controversial issue, it is a safe and legal option for many women in certain circumstances.
24	Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by the removal or expulsion from the uterus of a fetus or embryo, resulting in or caused by its death. An abortion can occur spontaneously due to complications during pregnancy or can be induced, in humans and other species. In the context of human pregnancies, an abortion can be carried out either surgically or medicinally for various reasons, such as to ensure the safety of the mother or to reduce risks to the fetus. While abortion carries a stigma in some cultures, in many cases it is seen as a valid option for women to have autonomy over their bodies.
25	Abortion is necessary to ensure population control in order to prevent population growth from becoming unmanageable. If abortion were to become illegal, women would be forced to turn to unsafe methods or seek out illegal procedures which could lead to serious health complications. This could potentially occur later in pregnancy, making it more difficult and often more expensive.
26	I thank my opponent for their response. Abortion can be considered morally grey, as it is difficult to determine the right or wrong course of action in every situation. Ultimately, the decision to have an abortion should be made by the woman, as it is her body and her decision. Every woman should have access to the care and information they need in order to make an informed choice, which could include abortion. While it may not be the right choice for everyone, it can be an important option for some.
27	"Pro" believes that abortion is an important option in certain situations, as it can provide a woman with the autonomy to make decisions about her body. If abortion were not available, women may be forced to carry unwanted pregnancies, leading to an increase in population. Therefore, access to safe and legal abortion should be available.
28	Most people that support legal access to abortion do so for a variety of reasons, including a desire to ensure women have autonomy over their bodies and reproductive health. While some opponents of abortion may be motivated by emotional or moral reasons, there is evidence that making abortion legal can help reduce the overall number of abortions, while keeping abortion legal can help to maintain safe access while also reducing maternal mortality
29	This is an important topic to consider and there are many different views on the morality of abortion. It is important to evaluate the ethical implications of any decision and understand how each side may view the issue. Both perspectives should be considered when making a decision.
30	Life is the ability to grow, change, and adapt over time that distinguishes plants and animals from non-living things. This is made possible by metabolism, which allows organisms to regulate their inner structure and restore balance by taking in nutrients, breaking down or building up these nutrients as needed to store or release energy. This helps them survive and thrive in their environment.
31	Trump’s candidacy has created a space where racism has been more visible than in past presidential elections since the civil rights movement. Research shows that racism can have a detrimental effect on individuals, causing physical and mental health issues, reduced productivity and reduced life expectancy. Additionally, experiences of racism can lead to social exclusion and economic disadvantage.
32	I will be the president who brings about the greatest job growth in America's history. I will bring jobs back from overseas and create more opportunities for Americans. Unfortunately, the American dream has become harder to achieve, but as president, I will work to make it possible for all again.
33	Trump's rhetoric can be provocative at times, and while I believe he has the best intentions in mind, his words and actions can be misconstrued. To tackle the debt, it is important to look at the whole picture and consider different strategies that could help. It is important to consider how various policies will work together to have the greatest impact.
34	Ranchers in Arizona have long been known to take action to protect their borders from illegal immigration. They have been known to hunt down and apprehend individuals attempting to cross the border undocumented, with some reportedly using dogs as well as calling the Border Patrol to assist in the apprehensions. This practice was reportedly inspired by some right-wing Republican politicians, such as Pat Buchanan, who argued for greater action to be taken to preserve the United States as an ethnically-white, Christian nation.   Whilst this type of vigilantism may be seen as necessary in some cases, it has potential to lead to significant human rights abuses. This highlights the importance of having proper border control measures in place, while also safeguarding the rights of all individuals regardless of their legal status.   It is therefore important to consider the potential risks of taking such measures into one’s own hands when deciding on policy, which is why voting to
35	In 2000, when Trump ran for president under the Reform Party, he supported the idea of universal healthcare as an option. In early 2015, he proposed a deal between the government and hospitals to help low-income Americans, which is consistent with his current healthcare plan. While Trump’s plan is not a direct implementation of universal healthcare, it does provide more coverage for those who need it while still maintaining a free market system. This system is tailored to provide access to healthcare while still allowing for private insurance and competition among providers.   Overall, Trump’s plan allows for a mix of both private and public healthcare options, creating a system that provides more coverage while still allowing for competition and choice. This provides a viable alternative to a full-fledged universal healthcare system, giving Americans more control over their healthcare while still allowing for some public funding.
36	Trump has proven himself to be an effective negotiator, as he is able to navigate complex deals while taking into account various factors. Although he has made some controversial statements in the past, his success shows that he knows how to strike a balance between his views and reaching an agreement. He is not afraid to express his opinions if necessary.
37	A card of any suit can work in combination with other cards to produce a winning hand, while a President of the World would need to have the support of all the other countries in order to be successful. A world leader needs the support of the global community in order to be successful, so a card of any suit is more appropriate than one
38	"WashPo's list is full of clearly misleading statements, which is different from outright lies. It is difficult to determine the exact number of lies for any President, but based on the data available, Trump does appear to have told more lies than any other President during their first two years in office."   It is clear that Trump has told more lies than any other President during their first two years in office, based on the available data. Although it is difficult to definitively determine the number
39	Donald Trump was accused by Hillary Clinton of being a racist, which he denied. He stated that Clinton was desperate for votes in the Democratic primary and was using old issues to try to gain an advantage. Trump noted that Clinton was attacking him instead of Jeb Bush, indicating that Bush was likely the real competition at that point. He argued that this showed Bush was seen as more formidable than Clinton.
40	I believe that the decision for Britain to leave the European Union should be respected, as it was made after a democratic process. While I understand the importance of respecting the will of the people, it is important to consider the implications of Brexit on both the UK and EU countries. It is essential that all parties involved are aware of the potential impacts of the decision.
41	Britain's membership in the EU costs around 6.3 billion pounds per year, which accounts for around 0.3% of the UK's GDP. While the UK does benefit from selling commodities to the EU, it also has access to a larger market of 450 million consumers. Additionally, leaving the EU would offer the UK more control over its immigration policy.  Recent data shows that around 70% of the UK's population growth is due to immigration. This suggests that immigration is an important factor in driving population growth and therefore has a significant effect on the economy.  As such, it is clear that leaving the EU would have a significant impact on both immigration policy and the UK economy as a whole.
42	Switzerland and Norway are not in the EU, and while being a part of the union comes with certain obligations, each member state still has the autonomy to make decisions based on what is best for their country. The EU's ultimate goal is to bring all of Europe together into a unified region, but this is a complex process that requires the involvement of multiple countries and respect for each one's sovereignty.
43	England has had success outside of the European Union in the past, as seen with Switzerland and Norway. While having open borders can have its challenges, it can also bring many benefits to countries and economies. The UK’s decision to leave the EU is a complex one, and it is important to consider both sides when deciding how to move forward.  While it is true that some countries may not benefit from being in a union, it is also important to consider the benefits that can be gained from collaboration.
44	I was not at all implying that Britain should adopt a model similar to that of the European Union. I was in no way implying that we should depart from the European Union without any influence from Brussels. We will accept migrants and refugees while still leaving the EU, which gives us more autonomy and the ability to determine our own policies. Times have changed, and it is clear that the economic struggles of some of the other European countries pose a challenge for all of them. Britain must look to find ways to improve its economy while still exiting the European Union.
45	My opponent appears to be overlooking the finer points of the argument. While it is important to use sources, this should be done by attributing the information to the original source. This can be done by quoting the source and also by correctly referencing it. Failing to do so is an act of plagiarism, and can have serious consequences.
46	The UK's decision to leave the European Union has caused a number of challenges for the country, including an increase in migration from other countries looking for jobs, as well as a decline in living standards. This has had a particularly difficult impact on families in England, who may find it difficult to provide for their children's education.
47	Britain has been a member of the European Union for some time now and a departure from the union could mean adjusting to a new way of operating in order to ensure a successful transition. While it is understandable to want to remain connected on matters of terrorism, it is important to recognize that Britain's exit from the European Union may necessitate changes in how information is shared. This could potentially provide opportunities to refine the process in order to enhance the effectiveness of counter-terrorism efforts.  Thus, it is important to keep an open mind to the potential benefits of Brexit and understand the potential challenges that may come with it.
48	I believe in a more independent UK, as this allows the country to make decisions in its own best interests. While there may be some uncertainty at first, I believe that the UK will eventually find success as an independent nation. This has been shown in the past, and I believe it is a path worth pursuing. I understand that this can be difficult to accept, but I believe my view is valid. Thank you for sharing your opinion and providing me with new information.
49	In 2003 alone, 10 wrongfully convicted defendants were released from death row, illustrating the potential risk of capital punishment. In California, the death penalty system costs $137 million per year compared to $11.5 million for a system without the death penalty. This suggests that states without the death penalty may have lower crime rates due to the financial burden of implementing capital punishment. Ultimately, both options have their drawbacks, but it is likely that being imprisoned for life with the knowledge that one could potentially reflect on the crime and its consequences could be more distressing than death.
50	The death penalty carries the risk of innocent people being executed as the government must make difficult decisions with the information available. In some cases, innocent people can be executed if the original verdict is later reversed. This shows that the government should take responsibility for mistakes made as it is unavoidable in some cases.   LWOP is typically seen as a more cost-effective punishment due to its lower cost, as it does not require multiple trials or executions. While this may cost more initially, in the long run it can save money as the punishment is given once and done.   Opponents of the death penalty note that the cost of executions can vary significantly over time, and can often cost up to three or 10 times more than LWOP over the course of an individual case. This emphasizes the need to weigh the costs of both punishments carefully before making a decision.
51	The death penalty has been shown to have a significant impact on crime rates in states such as Texas, Louisiana, and Alabama. This is likely due to the increase in executions which can cause short-term decreases in murder rates. Removing the death penalty may have negative effects as it can lead to higher murder rates as states without the death penalty see.   It is important to take into account both the financial and emotional cost of keeping someone in prison for life. This can be compared to the cost of executing an individual and determining which is the more cost-efficient method. Additionally, the availability of DNA testing should be taken into account, as this can provide an alternative method of ensuring justice while still reducing costs.   In conclusion, although death penalty can lead to lower murder rates in the short-term, it is important to consider the cost of keeping someone in prison for life compared to execution which can provide greater cost-efficiency.
52	The death penalty has been shown to deter crime and can be a deterrent when applied in certain cases. Capital punishment can serve as a deterrent to criminals as it can cause them to fear the consequences of their actions. This can lead to a decrease in crime as potential offenders may be more hesitant to commit a crime knowing the consequences. Capital punishment should, however, only be used in conjunction with other criminal justice measures in order to ensure fair trials and due process. Ultimately, the decision should be made on a case-by-case basis.
53	The death penalty is often seen as a deterrent as it removes the threat of capital punishment from an individual. This means that they are less likely to commit further offences as they know that the penalty would be carried out. This can be seen by looking at the link provided, which provides a chart documenting the homicide rate per 100,000 population from 1950 to 2002. It clearly shows a decrease in the murder rate in those states which have the death penalty in place.
54	The death penalty is a costly form of punishment and can often result in innocent people being executed. This can be difficult to prevent, as the justice system does not always ensure that only guilty individuals are punished. Thus, it can be more expensive in the long run when compared to other forms of punishment. There can be variations in costs depending on the state, however, so it is important to consider the financial impact of any given punishment.
55	The death penalty implies that a jury of twelve people is qualified to take life into their own hands. If someone is wrongly convicted and sent to prison, it is an unfortunate mistake that can occur in any criminal trial. Although this is a distressing outcome, it is preferable to incorrectly assigning the death sentence and taking away the chance of rehabilitation.
56	Death penalty cases can incur significant additional costs to both the prosecution and defense, as well as appellate courts. This can amount to an additional $470,000 in costs in comparison to non-death penalty murder cases. Furthermore, death penalty cases can also require additional resources on direct appeal, with costs ranging from $100,000 to $137,000 for personal restraint petitions.   These costs can be high, resulting in a potential for savings if the death penalty was not utilized. This could provide an opportunity to limit the number of cases in which the death penalty is used, providing more equity in the criminal justice system.
57	I believe the death penalty to be necessary. Morally, it makes sense that a serial killer should face the ultimate penalty for their multiple crimes. Although the Government may already have too much power, the death penalty can provide a sense of justice and put the public’s mind at ease. While there is no way to guarantee success, it is still a valid punishment option. If most penitentiaries in the US were to follow the model of Sheriff Joe Arpaio, with his degrading treatment of prisoners, it would be seen as fair and appropriate. For as long as Britain continues to send prisoners to tax-funded 5-star hotels, it is clear that the death penalty should remain an option.
58	The death penalty can be an effective form of punishment as it offers the opportunity for justice to be served and can help to deter potential future crime. However, in some cases it can be difficult to ensure a fair outcome and it is important to consider the long-term impacts that it may have. Life imprisonment without the possibility of parole can provide a more humane alternative as it offers the possibility of rehabilitation and re-integration into society, while still providing justice. Furthermore, the introduction of moral values into society can help to ensure that society has a greater understanding of what is right and wrong, reducing the chance of crime occurring in the first place.
59	Google's release of products such as Google Classroom and self-driving cars could lead to a future in which all documents are available online and physical paper may become extinct. With the rise of such technology, companies have the potential to gain greater control over users, making it important for consumers to be aware and cautious.
60	"Google receives an average of 188 million visitors per day, while Bing receives 60 million per day, indicating that Google is more popular among web users. This suggests that Google is a better search engine as it is able to attract more users compared to Bing. Furthermore, the sound of Google's name creates a more ominous atmosphere when compared to Bing's more upbeat sound."
61	Google is a reliable source, so Pro should win. Con's search results proved to be reliable, which indicates that Pro is correct. Therefore, Con is wrong as Con's sources may not be reliable in all cases. Despite this, it is still important to use reliable sources when making an argument, thus emphasizing the importance of Pro's sources.
62	My opponent has failed to refute any points that I have made. He also stated that “GOOGL provides an essential service and should be regulated accordingly,” which acknowledges the importance of regulation while still recognizing the value of the company. This indicates that regulation is necessary to ensure the beneficial impact of companies like GOO
63	Bing is often overlooked in comparison to Google, as it can be difficult to judge the two search engines fairly due to the bias of many users. While some individuals prefer Google due to its familiarity, others may not be aware of the full capabilities of Bing. It is important to consider both engines and use the one that best meets the needs of the user.
64	Google is protecting its interests by investing in new technologies and ensuring its long-term success. This is a natural part of business, and is common among existing companies in the world. While monopolies and oligopolies do exist, they can be difficult to combat as they often provide more efficient services than smaller companies.
65	Is any company paying Google for result slots? It is certainly beneficial to businesses in certain industries to be visible on the first page of search results as it can drive more traffic and sales. Established authorities in various subject areas have the resources to invest in search engine optimization and advertising to make sure they
66	There is still a level of familiarisation that needs to take place in order to use Google Glass in a practical setting. While testing can be an effective tool for learning in some cases, it may not be the best approach in this instance due to the complexities of the device.
67	"Is the Google Review Rating System good or bad? " I would agree that this system is beneficial in providing customers with accurate reviews, as it allows them to make informed decisions. It also offers businesses more transparency and allows them to better monitor and manage their reviews. This can be beneficial for businesses as it can provide an opportunity to improve customer service and overall reputation. Although this system offers advantages, it is important to consider how it may impact businesses. Therefore, it is important for businesses to ensure that they are well prepared and understand the potential benefits and drawbacks of using the system.
68	Google+ is a free account that provides a great deal of flexibility and convenience. The higher character limit allows users to more easily articulate their arguments without having to break up their comments into multiple pieces. This can be beneficial when engaging in a debate as it provides more space to make your point. As the limit can reach up to 10,000 characters, this can be a powerful tool for those wanting to convey their thoughts and opinions.
69	Going vegan can be beneficial to the environment as companies are able to source vegetable-based ingredients which can help reduce the impact of animal agriculture. Additionally, switching to vegan options can also help reduce animal suffering and promote animal welfare, as well as helping to improve the lives of those working in the animal agriculture industry. Although veganism may represent a matter of diet or lifestyle for some, ethical veganism is a profound moral and political commitment to abolition. Therefore, although vegan options may be more expensive, it is possible to find vegan alternatives which still provide the same great taste, whilst reducing the impact on animal welfare, people’s health and global poverty.
70	Veganism is the practice of abstaining from the use of animal products, particularly in diet, as well as following an associated philosophy that rejects the commodity status of sentient animals. The vegan ethos is motivated by the recognition that all sentient beings have intrinsic value and deserve respect and compassion. Vegans strive to reduce animal suffering and exploitation, while still maintaining a healthy and balanced diet.  The vegan diet provides a way for individuals to reduce their environmental footprint while still meeting their nutritional needs.
71	It is likely that a vegan diet would be beneficial to the majority of people in the world as it requires less acreage than an omnivorous diet, while also reducing the amount of animal suffering. Additionally, a vegan diet is believed to be just as nutritionally effective as an omnivorous one when accompanied by the appropriate multivitamins. This is beneficial for both human health and the environment as it can reduce the burden on global agriculture.
72	In many countries, including America, the majority of the population eat meat. Transitioning to vegan alternatives may not be feasible for all meat-eating countries. This could pose challenges when looking to replace meat, as animals like pigs may no longer be as useful. While it may not be possible to transition entirely, it may still be possible to reduce the amount of meat being consumed over time.
73	Lacto-ovo vegetarianism is a diet that excludes animal flesh, but includes dairy products and eggs. Hippopotamuses are classified alongside other two-toed animals such as camels, cattle, deer and pigs. Camels and cattle are vegetarian, while pigs are not, as they lack a strict vegan diet. However, camels are related to llamas and alpacas, while cows have their cousin the bison, deer are related to elks and gazelles. Thus, a vegan diet might not be as inclusive as it could be, as some animals may still require a more specialised diet in order to receive all the necessary nutrients.
74	Meat eaters are not necessarily aware of the impact their diets can have on the environment, but it is important to consider the environmental implications of food production. Livestock can have a significant impact on resource depletion, with the production of animal products requiring a greater use of resources such as water, grain, and land. Plant-based alternatives can help to reduce this impact, as they require fewer resources to produce and can help to protect the environment.
75	I believe that veganism is an important way to reduce animal suffering and promote environmental sustainability. Eating animal products can have a negative impact on the environment and animal welfare, as animal agriculture contributes to climate change and animal suffering.   Whilst veganism can be beneficial to the environment and animals, it can also have a negative impact on human health. Therefore, it is important to consider the nutritional needs of the individual when making dietary changes. It is important to ensure that any dietary changes made are sustainable in the long-term and balanced to ensure that both human and animal health are taken into consideration.
76	Most women these days are comfortable with the concept of vegan sex, as some couples may prefer to consume sexual lubricants together. Some women may be more comfortable using a personal lubricant, while others may prefer for their partner to use a lubricant as well. This gives couples the opportunity to engage in vegan sex while still satisfying both partners' needs.
77	I dispute my opponent's claim that love custard is not a commodity. When a vegan woman chooses to eat plant-based alternatives alongside her partner’s meals, she can still enjoy the meal as much as the meat-eater. Veganism is an ethical choice that allows room for compromise in order to accommodate different dietary needs. Socialism also allows for individual choice, which can lead to both vegan and non-vegan meals being consumed as part of a balanced diet. Therefore, vegan women are able to make a conscious decision based on their beliefs, while still adhering to their diet.
78	It is widely known that most animals are herbivores, and some species, such as lions, are primarily vegetarian and may subsist on a mainly vegan diet. Therefore, it is important to consider the wide variety of animals that may require a vegan diet in order to thrive.
79	Nuclear power plants are an energy source which can provide us with significantly more energy than other options. 95% of the energy generated by nuclear plants is not released as CO2, which is beneficial for the environment. However, there are risks associated with nuclear energy, such as radiation exposure. Although accidents like Chernobyl are rare, the potential for a similar event to occur remains. We need to be aware of the potential risks, but also trust in our modern technology and expertise to make nuclear energy a viable option.
80	There is no doubt that nuclear energy is a viable option as it offers many benefits such as efficiency, affordability and lower environmental impact. However, it is important to consider the safe disposal of nuclear waste which is a challenge that has yet to be fully addressed. Wind, hydro, and solar energy sources are often preferred as they are more cost-effective and less likely to have negative environmental impacts. As magnetic energy develops in the future, everyone could benefit from this innovation.
81	Nuclear power is an efficient and cost-effective source of energy. Although nuclear waste is a challenge, the benefits of nuclear energy outweigh the negatives due to its low costs, high efficiency, and positive economic impacts.
82	I believe that nuclear energy should be utilized more heavily while we search for more sustainable energy sources. Fortunately, there is a new material called thorium which becomes safe after 100 years, and research is ongoing to develop ways of reusing nuclear power. To address the volcano risk, it may be beneficial to locate a waste storage facility in a tectonic plate, where the risk of an accident is lower and technology can continue to improve. Though this comes at a cost, it is worth the investment in order to ensure safety.
83	We should not rely heavily on nuclear energy as it comes with several risks. Radioactive waste is a major issue as it can be dangerous and difficult to dispose of. The cost of production can be high, and we may be relying on deep geological storage which could have long-term consequences we are not yet aware of. Solar energy is becoming increasingly affordable, making it a realistic option for many households.
84	I will first defend my argument and acknowledge the potential risk of nuclear power plants in the event of natural disasters. While the US power plants were lucky to avoid damage from Hurricane Sandy and other natural disasters, this could potentially be a risk in the future.   However, I believe that the US has been successful in maintaining high standards for nuclear power plants and mitigating this risk. This is primarily due to the fact that US power plants are increasingly designed with redundancy and safety in mind. As a result, while an event like Hurricane Sandy may cause disruption, the damage sustained is often minor and repairable.  I also believe that building multiple power plants simultaneously can help to reduce costs in terms of both initial investment and ongoing maintenance. This is due to the economies of scale which can be achieved by combining multiple projects into one.
85	Nuclear energy can be a cost-effective and profitable solution for electricity production when compared to other sources of energy. It does not add to the existing environmental impact and can provide a clean and reliable source of energy.
86	In this round, my opponent again misinterpreted my argument, which I believe was done either deliberately or accidentally. I argued that solar technology has been proven over many years and is a reliable and proven source of energy. I also stated that alternative sources of energy should be used in combination with nuclear energy to ensure a reliable and sustainable source of energy. It is clear that a mix of different energy sources is necessary to provide a secure and long-term supply of energy, and so solar energy should be used in conjunction with nuclear energy in order to meet current and future energy needs.
87	My opponent needs to look back to my round 2 where I proved carbon is released in earlier stages, this is a problem that my opponent has acknowledged. While my opponent argued that nuclear energy may cause carbon emissions in the short-term, they recognize that in the long-term nuclear energy has the potential to reduce overall carbon emissions when compared to other energy sources. Thus, the two sides agree that nuclear energy could cause fewer carbon emissions in the long-term.
88	We're fast reaching the end of the earth's supply of oil, and while wind energy can be a useful source of energy, it cannot provide the amount of energy required to power a metropolis like New York. Nuclear energy may be a viable solution as it has a lower carbon footprint and can provide a more consistent source of energy.   While alternative energy sources are definitely promising, it is important to consider the limitations of each and to ensure that the necessary infrastructure is in place to support their use. Everyone has their own limitations, so it is important to take these into account and think of creative ways to make a difference in the world.
89	There have been several articles posted on the internet that suggest that Donald Trump may not be as conservative as he appears. Some have suggested that he may be more of a spoiler candidate, taking away votes that could have gone to another Republican candidate. This has raised questions among conservatives and independents as to whether he truly means what he is saying. Only time will tell if this gamble paid off, as Trump has said he believes in.  It is clear that Trump's message has resonated with many voters and he has seen success in the polls. This raises questions as to whether his platform is genuine and whether his actions will align with his stated beliefs. This is a concern for voters who want to ensure that their values are aligned with the candidate they choose to support.
90	Donald Trump has certain qualities that make him a risky choice for president. In his last debate, he claimed that he would be able to solve international issues single-handedly, implying that he saw himself as a kind of "savior" of the United States. While the US and Iraq have had some disputes in the past, Syria has not posed the same level of threat and it is important that the US
91	Donald Trump has limited political experience, but his policies and viewpoints could cause significant disruption to US trade relations with China and Mexico, leading to job losses. He has also been criticized for being racist and sexist, as well as for not providing enough detail on how he plans to replace Obamacare. It is important to consider the potential consequences of such policies before supporting them.
92	Donald Trump has limited political experience and is perceived as having more extreme views than some other candidates. This could pose a risk as he may not be able to implement his policies effectively. While Trump has offered broad statements about replacing Obamacare, it is unclear exactly what he would do or how this could affect healthcare. Additionally, his stance on trade with China and Mexico could cause disruption to the US economy, particularly as these trade relationships are important for jobs and growth.
93	It is clear that Donald Trump poses a great risk to democracy and stability. His desire to rule with absolute power is a shared goal between the Sith and him, as evidenced by his public appearances where he has been seen wearing traditional Sith cloaks. It is therefore essential to keep an eye on his progress and stop him from taking the seat of ultimate power.
94	Donald Trump's statements on racism have been highly controversial, as he has at times seemed to condone or even justify racial inequalities. He has said that certain races can be perceived as more likely to be lazy, which can be seen as a racist view. Additionally, he has been accused of lying when he claimed to be the "least racist" person. His comments about Native Americans have also been viewed as insensitive. All of this indicates that Trump may have a
95	I did not specify that I was talking about Donald Trump, the 45th President of the United States. Although there are some similarities between Donald Trump and the fictional character I described, there are enough differences that it is clear that I am referring to the real-life president.
96	A President must have the ability to connect and relate to the people of the United States. Donald Trump has already caused some protests due to his policies, such as the Women’s March, which shows that he is not as popular as one would hope. This could be concerning as it suggests that he may have difficulty in implementing his policies.
97	Hillary Clinton called Trump a racist and Trump responded: “I believe that the accusations against me are part of a wider effort to influence the election. These charges are being leveled by an opponent who is desperate to remain competitive, and it is clear that they are intended to overshadow the successes of my campaign.”   Trump’s response indicated that he believes Clinton’s actions were motivated by her competition and the desire to remain successful in the primary. He asserted that her actions were part of a broader effort and recognized the need to address the charges while also acknowledging Clinton’s attempts to remain competitive.
98	I am hesitant to support Donald Trump due to his approach, but I appreciate that he is speaking honestly and is willing to take risks to try and turn around the current situation. This could be beneficial for the long-term, though it may be difficult to see in the short-term. I understand why he may want to transition out of office, but it is important for the Democrats to take responsibility for their actions and take the necessary steps to fix the issues.
